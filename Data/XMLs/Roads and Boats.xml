In ROADS & BOATS, each player builds up a civilization over a long period of time, like in many
other games. Unlike most games, however, ROADS
& BOATS is not about warfare, population growth,
city or statebuilding. The emphasis instead is on
logistics, or rather: on transport.
Each player starts the game with three donkeys, a
pile of wooden boards, a number of stones and two
geese. With these few resources, you try to build
such diverse things as woodcutters, roads, boats,
mines, a stock exchange... but beware! There is no
concept of territory in this game: you cannot own
land, nor buildings, so the things you build can be
used by any other player.
The game can be played by one to five players and
lasts approximately four hours.

SUMMARY
& BOATS is played in turns. Each turn
consists of four phases. In each phase, all players
play simultaneously.
OADS

Players first go through a production phase in which all
buildings produce goods. There are primary producers
which produce goods every production phase (such as a
woodcutter, which produces one pile of trunks every
production phase). Secondary producers produce goods
only when fed the appropriate input goods (for
example, the sawmill will cut each pile of trunks
delivered into two sets of boards in the production
phase).

MATERIAL
free to write us. Please try to phrase your questions so
that we can answer them with “Yes (because ...)” or “No
(because ...)”. You can also check our website for any
previously asked questions. Our addresses can be found
on the inside of the cover.

GAME MATERIAL
For each player (red, yellow, green or blue) there are:
30 wooden transporters, 15 walls (wooden rods), 2
wooden discs in the player’s colour;
40 cardboard wonder bricks in
the player’s colour;

Second, players go through a movement phase in which all
their transporters may move according to their abilities.
The transporters move goods from one tile to another
in order to produce new goods or to build new
buildings. As the game progresses, players will make
new transporters which can carry more and move more
steps.

1 home marker in the player’s
colour (for technical reasons,
the counter sheets contain 3 red
and 3 yellow home markers, but
only one of each is needed);

The next phase that the players go through each turn is
the building phase. Players may construct buildings on
tiles on which they have one of their transporters and
the goods required to build that building (e.g. two sets
of boards for a stone quarry). These buildings will start
producing goods in the next production phase. Players
may also build roads to allow their transporters to move
to new tiles, and walls to prevent other players from
taking away goods that they want to use.

8 research markers (glass stones);

At the end of the turn, in the wonder phase, all players
may contribute bricks to build a wonder. When this
wonder is finished, the game ends. The player who has
gathered most wealth points, especially stock bonds,
wins the game. Players can influence the length of the
game by building more bricks in the wonder.

1 research table;

1 player aid that lists the most important rules.

Research Table

Furthermore, there are:
15 neutral walls (plain-wooden rods);
33 neutral (white) wonder bricks;
18 mines (brown wooden cylinders);

After the wonder phase, the production phase of the
next turn starts.

18 little plastic bags that go with the mines;

Beginners at the game are advised to regard their first
(few) games as practice. ROADS & BOATS is one of those
games that you should start without knowing all the
rules. Understanding will come through experience.
The player aids contain a summary of the most important
rules. Use them. For hints on strategy and for oneplayer rules, see the scenario book.

140 hexagonal tiles; check that you have three
copies of sheet Ax3 and one copy of sheet Bx1;

This book should answer all questions about the game
rules. If you still find something missing or unclear, feel

one more glass stone (to use on the phase chart);
rule book and scenario book;
If you ever need more goods, buildings, walls or
coloured (non-white) wonder bricks, you may create
new ones. The number supplied is not meant to limit
the game.

FIRST-TIME PREPARATIONS
The sticker sheets hold a series of mine numbers and 8
stickers in the players' colours. For each of the numbers,
put one sticker on a mine and the other sticker on a
mine bag. The players' stickers should go on the wooden
discs of the same colour. For each player there is a
praying figure and a sequence marker.

SETTING UP
The game world will be as large as the plastic sheet.
Keep in mind that extra space is needed around it for
the player aids, research tables, the wonder and the piles
of other game parts. The wonder board is put next to
the playing area so that every player can see it. Put a
glass stone on the phase chart. The tiles, the buildings
and the goods are placed so that players can easily reach
them. Each player chooses a colour and takes the
corresponding supplies of transporters, walls and wonder bricks, a home marker, a research table and a player
aid. Cover each item on each research table with a
research marker (glass stone).

The Wonder
There are two ways to make a map. Inexperienced players are advised to select one of the maps provided in the
scenario book. More experienced players may want to
make a map of their own using the following rules.
Determine how big the map is going to be.
As a rough estimate, use about ten land tiles per player.
The number of sea tiles can be varied as you please. You
can use more land tiles if you want to have a long buildup phase before the interaction starts, or less if you want
to start interacting with each other right away. In our
opinion, it is advisable to give every player at least some
opportunity to settle before being harassed by others,
but you may think otherwise. A lot of sea tends to give
very interactive, hostile games.
World Size

Starting Player The player who proposed to play ROADS

& BOATS starts laying the map.
CREATING THE WORLD

woods (dark green)

Proceed clockwise. Every player places
two tiles in the playing area, one by one, such that each
tile borders on at least one other tile already present.
Each tile can be placed anywhere, except for rivers.

pasture (light green)

Rivers Rivers must be placed in a natural way. You may

The world map consists of hexagonal tiles of six
different types (some of the tiles contain a river):

rock (grey)
mountains (brown)
desert (yellow) and
sea (blue).

Tile Placement

start a river only by playing a source tile or by playing a
normal river tile such that it flows into the sea. You may
not place a tile such that a river ends without a source or
that finishing another river becomes impossible. For
instance, you may not use the last “straight” river tile if
it is needed elsewhere, nor may you start a river if all

SETTING UP
sources have been used elsewhere. A river may not run
off the map.

ORDER OF PLAY
ORDER OF PLAY
LL players start the game simultaneously. Each
game turn consists of four phases. These are:

1. (re-)production
2. movement

Source Tile

Normal River Tiles

3. building
4. wonder construction

Covering the Map

Place the plastic sheet over the map.
Make sure the entire map is covered. Fix the sheet in
place with adhesive tape that can be removed easily after
playing.
DETERMINING THE STARTING SEQUENCE
Put the praying figures in a cup and take them out one
by one. Place the markers in the row at the temple. The
first figure taken out of the cup is placed closest to the
temple. The corresponding sequence markers are
placed on the sequence chart in the same order from left
to right. So the first position is for the player whose
praying figure is furthest from the temple. The players
choose their starting places in the order as indicated on
the sequence chart.

Throughout the game, the phase chart is used to indicate which phase is being played.
In principle, all players resolve each phase simultaneously. Sometimes, conflicts may arise as to the order of
play within a phase. Each player may request that the
order of play is established when the phase is about to
begin. If such a request is made, the order of play is
determined according to the conflict rules on page 17.
If the order of play has not been determined at the
beginning of the phase, conflicts may nevertheless arise
during the phase. In that case, play is in the order of the
sequence markers on the sequence chart.

STARTING PLACES AND RESOURCES
Any land tile may be chosen as a starting place, provided
there is at least one empty tile between you and your
nearest neighbour. It is advisable to select a starting tile
close to rock, woods and pasture. Mark the tile by
putting your home marker on the tile. All initial
resources are also placed on the tile: each player gets 3
donkeys, 5 sets of boards, 1 pile of stones and 2 geese.
On some maps, it may be advisable to determine which
tiles will be starting tiles instead of letting the players
choose freely. In many scenarios, starting tiles are so
marked.

PRODUCTION
(RE-)PRODUCTION PHASE
the (re-)production phase, every tile is checked for production. Production takes place on
tiles with primary producers, secondary producers and
on empty pasture tiles containing livestock. Research
can also be produced. This is explained in a separate section.
N

Some goods (stone, fuel) can be produced by either a
primary or a secondary producer.
PRIMARY PRODUCERS
Primary producers are represented by large square
pieces with an encircled symbol. They produce one item
of the appropriate type every production phase. They
produce even if no transporter is nearby! The item produced should be placed on the tile or on a transporter
on that tile. In case of a conflict, see the rules about the
order of play above.
Primary producers (and their products) are: woodcutters (trunks), stone quarries (stone), clay pits (clay),
oil rigs (fuel) and mines (gold and iron) (pictures on the
back cover).
Mines

Mines have a variable output. Each turn, for
each mine, a counter is drawn randomly from the bag
with the mine's number. This counter is either iron ore
or gold. The mine produces the product drawn. Mines
with empty bags do not produce anything.
SECONDARY PRODUCERS
Secondary producers are represented by large square
pieces with the symbol of their product. Secondary
producers produce one item of the appropriate type if
the required input goods are available.
If more than one set of input goods is available, a secondary producer produces as many sets of output goods,
provided its capacity is high enough. The capacity of a
producer is the maximum number of output goods it is
able to produce per turn.
E.g. a sawmill produces 2 sets of board if 1 pile of trunks
is present, 4 sets with 2 piles and 6 sets for 3 piles. If
more than 3 piles of trunks are present, the sawmill still
produces only 6 boards; the surplus trunks remain on
the tile.

8

PRODUCTION
Secondary producers (products) are: sawmills (board),
stone factories (stone), coal burners (fuel), papermills
(paper), mints (coins), and stock markets (stock bonds).
Pictures can be found on the back cover.
Coal burners and papermills can use either two piles of
trunks, two sets of boards, or one of both for input.
Goods on Transporters Goods on transporters will only be

used as input goods if the owner of the transporter
wants them to be used. To determine the order in which
goods from different transporters are processed, see the
conflict rules on page 17.
All output goods are placed on (one of) the transporter(s) the input goods came from. It is not possible to
forcibly take somebody else's output goods if he or she
turned in the input goods. If the transporter cannot
carry all output (see the movement section), any excess is
placed on the tile.
Goods on the tile

During the production phase, players
with a transporter on a factory tile can take goods from
the tile, deliver them to the factory for processing and
receive the output. They can take the output even if they
hand in goods from the tile only. In case of a conflict, see
the conflict rules (page 17).
After all players have produced what they want, each
factory will attempt to process any complete set of input
goods which remains on the tile. The output will be
placed on the tile unattended. The factory continues
processing goods from the tile until the full capacity for
that round has been exhausted, or until no complete set
of input goods remains. Coal burners and paper mills
will use all remaining boards on the tile before starting
to process trunks.

TRANSPORTER PRODUCTION
Some factories produce transporters. A transporter
automatically takes the colour of whoever handed in the
input goods.
Wagons

Wagons are always assigned to the player who
handed in the donkey. No other transporter of the donkey's owner needs to be present to claim the wagon.
Water transporters Water transporters must be placed in

the water immediately upon production. The transporter must be placed in a river flowing through the tile, or
on the coastline between the factory tile and a neigh-

PRODUCTION
bouring sea tile. In the latter case, the transporter can
only leave the tile by going to the sea tile chosen.
If a player cannot launch a water transporter because all
shores of the factory tile have been blocked by other
players' walls, he or she cannot use the factory.
Limited number of Transporters

At the end of the production phase, a player may own no more than eight
transporters; no more than five of these may be land
transporters, and no more than five may be water transporters.
As soon as a player owns too many transporters, he has
to put excess transporters out of use immediately. Only
a transporter that is currently at a transporter factory
can be put out of use: the transporter is destroyed by
simply taking it off the board. The transporter that is
destroyed does not need to have the same type as the
transporters produced by the factory. If the newly built
transporter and the one that delivered the input goods
are the only transporters at a transporter factory, one of
them must be destroyed immediately. When a transporter is destroyed, the goods used for its production
are not refunded.
Unclaimed transporters If enough input goods remain on

PRODUCTION
EXCHANGE OF GOODS, RIVERS
During the entire production phase, transporters on
the same tile can exchange goods with the tile and with
each other freely, if their owner(s) want them to.
Goods can be exchanged, delivered or taken across a
river only if there is a bridge, or a transporter in the river
that is willing to act as a ferry.
Practical Matters It is advisable to place newly produced

goods on the building, so as not to get confused. Every
player should look after the buildings he or she built to
make sure production is not forgotten. Place the goods
on the tile or transporter at the end of the production
phase.
Timing

Usually, all production takes place at the same
time. Sometimes, two players may want to use the same
secondary producer, or they may want to take the products of a primary producer before anyone else can. In
case of such a conflict, use the conflict rules on page 17.
Every player may choose to produce in whatever sequence he or she prefers. So, it is possible to produce
paper first, then use it to produce research, upgrade a
transporter factory (see page 16) and produce a transporter there in one turn.

the tile at the end of the production phase, and the
transporter factory's capacity has not been used by the
players, the factory will produce a transporter by itself.
Since the players have already completed their production phase, no one can claim the new transporter.
The transporter must therefore be destroyed. The input
goods are lost and no new transporter is brought into
the game.
Livestock

Livestock (donkeys, geese) will reproduce if
left as a pair on an empty pasture tile. A tile is empty if it
contains no building, goods or other transporters. In
the presence of a building, goods or other transporters,
donkeys or geese do not reproduce, not even if they are
on the other side of a river. However, roads, walls and a
home marker may be present. So two donkeys of the
same player will produce another donkey, but three will
not. Donkeys do not reproduce if their owner does not
want them to.
Note that deserts change into pasture, and can thus be
used for reproducing, as soon as the irrigation mark is
built (see the wonder phase).

Land transporters can move only over roads, except for

river blocks any road movement except on source tiles or
if a bridge is present.
Only a donkey could move from A to D. Even donkeys
cannot cross unbridged rivers.

A land transporter may move a number of tiles up to its
movement capacity each turn; it may move up and down a

road in one turn, provided it has enough movement
points available. Donkeys may move a maximum of 2
tiles (1 if there is no road), wagons 3 and trucks 4 tiles
per turn.

Goods which are dropped on a tile can be carried further by another player who moves later. However, no
goods may be moved by more than one transporter of the
same player in the movement phase of any one turn. To
reflect this, flip over goods that have been moved this
turn.
Any transporter may carry a number of goods up to its
carrying capacity. The goods are placed on top of the
transporter which carries them. Donkeys may carry up
to 2, wagons up to 3 and trucks up to 6 goods at a time.
A transporter may move more goods in a turn, if it
drops some goods before picking up more.
Example on next page: The donkey moves two steps, taking
one pile of trunks out of its tile and returning with two
piles of stones.
The wagon moves three steps, first taking three stocks,
which it drops on the donkey's tile, taking two piles of
trunks with it on the next step. It cannot take any stones,
as the stones have already been moved this turn.

While moving, a land transporter can pick up things
and drop them on any tile it passes, including the tile it

taken from or given to another transporter if its owner
is willing to yield or accept the goods. Goods can be
dropped on transporters instead of on the tile.

Example: The docked steamship first has to move into the
open sea, which would take up one movement point. It
could use its remaining five points to dock anywhere on
the coasts marked O. This will end its turn, no matter
how many movement points it used. The coast marked
X is too far to reach in one turn.
When docking near the river mouth, it has to choose at
which side to dock, so it can take either the boards or the
trunks. Note that docking at B does not give access to
the stones on that tile (but it would if there were a
bridge).
Before or instead of docking, the ship could travel up
and down the river, taking the boards, trunks and/or
stones and dropping resources without ending its turn.
It could also pass by the oil-rig or the raft and exchange
goods there without ending its turn.

Boats can move only on sea and rivers. On a river, a boat
moves just like a land transporter on a road. Moving
from a river to open sea takes up one movement point.
On open sea, boats can move from the coast to open sea,
between sea tiles and from a sea tile to a land tile at the
cost of one movement point per step. Moving from a sea
tile to a land tile, if not to enter a river, is called docking.
After docking, a boat may not move any further. A
docked boat is placed on the coastline between the land
tile and the sea tile it came from.
Only docked boats and boats on a river may interact
with a land tile. A docked boat can only leave the tile by
moving to the sea tile it came from.
Boats can exchange goods if they are on the same tile,
even on open sea.
The carrying/movement capacities of the water transporters are 3/3 for rafts, 5/4 for rowing boats and 8/6
for steamers.
It is not allowed to leave goods on a sea tile or to discard
them in any way.

WALLS
No transporter may move through a wall of another
player's colour. Moving through your own walls is
allowed, as is moving through neutral walls. When a
non-neutral wall has been built along the coast, only the
wall's owner can dock there.
CONFLICT
It is impossible under any circumstances to take goods
forcibly from somebody else's transporter. In case of
conflicts about taking goods from a tile, confer to the
conflict rules on page 17.
CARRYING TRANSPORTERS
Any transporter may carry another transporter. However, it is not allowed to move a transporter that has

11

MOVEMENT
moved on his own already in the same phase. Neither
transporter may carry anything else while one is carrying the other. The transporter can only be unloaded at
the beginning of a subsequent movement phase. In that
movement phase both transporters may carry goods as
normal.
Water transporters can be unloaded only at a river or a
sea shore. It is impossible under any circumstances to
leave a water transporter on the land, unless it is being
carried. A boat in a river can unload another boat only
in that river. A boat on shore can unload another boat
only on the same shore.
A transporter which is carrying another transporter can
still be followed by geese (see below).

BUILDING
BUILDING PHASE
may build by using goods from tiles on
which they have a transporter. It is possible to
build buildings, roads, bridges, walls and new mine
shafts. It is also possible to demolish walls.
LAYERS

PRESENCE OF TRANSPORTER
You may only build on tiles in which either a land
transporter, a boat in a river, or a docked boat of your
own colour is present. You cannot build anything on
the other side of a river unless a bridge is present. A boat
in the river can build on both sides. You cannot build
on a tile on which you have no transporter.

GEESE
Geese do not have to be carried by transporters, although they can be. A goose will follow any transporter
moving out of its tile, if the owner of the transporter
wants it to. However, geese cannot be left alone at sea: a
goose at sea will always follow a transporter moving out
of its tile, if no other transporter remains with the goose
(but geese can be dropped on an oil-rig, of course).
Geese do not follow transporters on the other side of a
river, unless there is a bridge.
Geese which had been following one player's transporter, will follow the transporter of another player
which passes through the tile, if that player wants them
to. The first player can prevent this only by loading the
geese on his transporter. In case of conflicts, see the
rules about the order of play on page 17.

BUILDINGS
Any building can be built by taking the relevant
building goods (a combination of boards and stones, as
indicated on the player aid) from your own transporter(s) or the tile. Cooperation between transporters
of different players is possible, that is, you may also use
goods from other players' transporters if they are willing
to put them at your disposal.
Only one building may be built on each tile. This is true
even if a river splits the tile. The home marker does not
count as a building. Buildings can never be removed.
Some buildings can only be built on certain tiles, as
indicated on the player aid. Possible restrictions are
mountains, rock, woods, sea or shore (i.e. a river tile or a
tile next to a sea tile). Only oil rigs may be built on a sea
tile. If no restriction applies, a building can be built on
any land tile except deserts.
Note that deserts convert into pasture as soon as the
irrigation mark has been built on (see the wonder
phase). Before that, only roads and walls can be built in
the desert.
Any factory that requires a shoreline can only be built
on a tile that contains a river or on a tile that borders on
a sea tile. A shore tile will always remain a shore tile,
even if it has been surrounded by walls. Note, however,
that you cannot produce a boat if you cannot put it
directly into the water. This allows players to deny other
players' the use of boat factories by building walls on the
shore of the tile that the boat factory is on.

BUILDING

Some buildings can only be built after the appropriate
research has been performed. See the research rules for
details.

on river shores.It is allowed to build a road that crosses a
wall, even if the wall belongs to another player. However, only the owner of the wall will be able to use the
road.

MINES

A road is built by drawing it with the marker on the
plastic plate.

If a player builds a mine, fill the appropriate bag with 3
gold nuggets and 3 iron ore counters (or 4/0, 0/4, 5/5 if
the appropriate research has been performed, see page
16).
The player who built the mine randomly draws one
counter from the bag each turn during the production
phase. This constitutes the production of that mine. If
the bag is empty, the mine does not produce anything.
It is, however, possible to extend the mine by building
new shafts, refilling the bag.
It is allowed at any time to look in the bags and count.
BUILDING NEW MINE SHAFTS
If the appropriate research has been performed, a
player may choose to build new shafts in any mine at
which he or she has a transporter. When building a new
shaft, three gold nuggets and three iron ore are added to
the contents of the mine's bag, whether it was already
empty or not. Instead of three gold and three iron, you
can add four of one kind or five of both. In that case you
must have done the appropriate research for that
mixture as well as for building new shafts (see page 16).
The added mixture can be another one than the
original one.
You may build as many shafts as you like, as long as you
hand in the necessary input goods (a new shaft costs one
iron and one fuel).
OIL RIGS
As an oil rig is built in open sea, it is not possible to leave
goods on the tile to build it. A player must therefore
carry all the required goods on his or her transporter(s)
to build it.
ROADS
A road may be built from the middle of the building tile
to the middle of a neighbouring tile by using one pile of
stones from (a transporter on) that tile. All roads on a
tile are automatically linked to each other, unless there
are rivers between the roads. Parallel roads can be built

BRIDGES
A bridge can be built by expending one pile of stones on
that tile. All roads on both sides of the river are subsequently connected. A bridge may be built even if there
are no roads present.
If a river tile contains no bridge, transporters, goods,
buildings and roads on that tile are considered to be on
one side of the river. For instance, a transporter on the
right side of the river cannot access goods or build anything on the left side of the river.
River springs never need a bridge. At river splittings,
two bridges are needed to connect all parts of the tile.
WALLS
A wall can be built between any two tiles, except between two sea tiles. Only the player who owns the wall
may pass through it. Other players may not pass.
A wall is built by using one pile of stones on any of the
two tiles it borders on. Place a wall token (wooden rod)
there.
The owner of a wall can strengthen it by paying an additional two piles of stones for a second wall token, an
additional three for a third, etc. This can be done immediately or in later turns. So a three token wall costs a
total of six piles of stone. There can never be walls of
more than one colour between two tiles at any one time.
Walls can be demolished by using two sets
of board on any of the tiles bordering the wall. The wall
counter is then taken from the tile and replaced by a
neutral wall token.
Demolishing

Walls that consist of two tokens may be demolished at a
cost of three sets of board, walls of three tokens by
expending four sets, etc.
A wall which is built “on top of” a
demolished wall counts as strengthening the existing
wall, even if it is done by another player. So, a second
wall costs two piles of stones and will be two tokens
Subsequent Walls

strong, a third wall costs three stones and will be three
tokens strong, etc. To keep track of this, neutral wall
tokens are used. A demolished wall is replaced with a
number of neutral wall counters equal to the number of
tokens in the demolished wall.

No Building From Both Sides

When building, strengthening or demolishing a wall, all necessary material has to
be provided from one side of the wall. It is not allowed
to provide the necessary goods for a wall or for a demolition from both sides of the wall. However, you can
build a wall from one side, then strengthen it from the
other.

Building from boats A docked boat can build or demolish

walls on any of the borders of the land tile it is in (except
on the other side of a river if there is no bridge). A boat
on sea, which is not docked, pays two extra piles of stone
or board to build or demolish a wall. Walls cannot be
built between sea tiles.
Building across rivers Walls can be built across rivers at no

extra cost.
Shutting Out Docked Boats

If a boat has docked and
another player builds a wall so as to close off its exit to
sea, so that the wall dissects the boat, then the boat is
placed immediately in the sea tile it came from. It is
then in open sea.
Example: The steamship can build a wall at A or C at a cost of
1 + 2 = 3 piles of stones because it is building from sea.
Demolishing wall D will cost 2 + 2 = 4 sets of boards, and
it would take 2 + 2 = 4 stones to immediately build a
new, stronger wall there.
Both rafts could build at A (cost: 1 stone); any wall at A
will push the other player's raft into the open sea.
Both rafts could also build a wall in the spaces marked F
(1 stone). Because of the river, they cannot build in
stretch G, unless they first build a bridge.
The truck could build at G, and/or demolish wall H (for
2 boards) or J (3 boards) and rebuild a wall there (at H
for 2 stone; at J for 3 stone).
The two donkeys cannot cooperate to build a strong wall
on top of the neutral wall at B, as they are not on the
same tile. The lower donkey could build on all the places
marked E.

WONDER

WONDER

WONDER PHASE
FTER the building phase, every player has the
opportunity to buy one or more bricks in the
wonder. A brick may yield 1 to 10 wealth points at the
end of the game (see victory conditions).

A player can buy an infinite amount of bricks each turn,
provided he or she has enough goods to do so. Goods
used to buy bricks in the wonder must be expended
from the player's starting tile. This tile must also
contain at least one of that player's transporters. Bricks
are always placed on the leftmost open place on the
lowermost uncompleted level of the wonder.
As long as the first four rows of the wonder have not
been fully built, the first brick bought by each player in
any one turn costs one goods token (any goods will do),
the second two, the third three, etc. Buying three bricks
in one turn is thus very costly (six goods). Bricks bought
by other players in the same turn do not count towards
this increase in price. As soon as the first four rows of
the wonder have been fully built, the first brick costs two
goods, the second three, etc.
As soon as a brick is built on the irrigation mark in the
wonder, all deserts are irrigated and converted into
pastures. The actual tiles do not have to be replaced.
After all players have had their chance to build in the
wonder, a neutral brick is added. It is placed on the
leftmost open place on the lowermost uncompleted
level of the wonder.
As soon as a brick is built on the mark indicating the
number of players, the wonder is complete and the
game ends.

RESEARCH

RESEARCH

RESEARCH

Big mines are filled with 5 gold nuggets and 5 iron ore. You cannot combine specialization and big mines.
Nevertheless you may research both to
specialize some mines and enlarge
others.

ESEARCH may be produced during the production phase. It enables a player to build things
which cannot be built otherwise.

PRODUCING RESEARCH
Research may be produced during the production phase
at the cost of two geese and one paper. No building is
needed. The geese and the paper must be on the same
tile, which must also contain one of the player's transporters. If two geese and a paper are left on a tile, that is,
if they are not being carried by a transporter, both geese
and paper are used by the game and disappear. This
leads to a great increase in metaphysical understanding
which has no practical relevance in the game.
ALLOCATING RESEARCH POINTS
Any research point must immediately be allocated to
one of the seven possible “projects”. This is indicated by
taking the glass stone off the appropriate slot on your
research table. Research points cannot be saved, nor can
they be traded in any way.
RESEARCH SUBJECTS
Factories
Researching these subjects gives a player the right to build certain buildings.
These buildings are indicated by an R
in the buildings table on the player
aid. No player may build any of these
buildings (rowboat factories, truck
factories, steam ship factories and oil
rigs) unless the appropriate research
has been completed.
Mines
In addition, it is possible to research the ability to build
better mines. There are two types of improvements:
specialized and big mines.
When built, specialized mines are not
filled with the usual three gold nuggets and iron ore, but may be filled
with 4 gold and 0 iron or vice versa.

16

Researching mines does not alter the stock of existing
mines in any way. You can still build normal mines
afterwards if you want to.
New Shafts
This subject enables a player to build
additional mine shafts (see building
rules).
Light bulb
This slot has no effect. It is reserved for
possible use with future expansion
rules.
UPGRADING TRANSPORTER FACTORIES
If a player researches a transporter factory (e.g. steam
ship factories), he or she may upgrade all (or some)
transporter factories of the appropriate type (land or
sea) provided one of that player's transporters is on the
same tile as the factory. So, if you have a wagon on a tile
with a raft factory, you may upgrade it to a steam ship
factory even if you did not build the factory yourself; on
the other hand, you may not upgrade factories on a tile
in which you do not have a transporter, even if you built
the factory yourself. Another player cannot prevent you
from upgrading even if he, too, has a transporter present.
Upgrading must be done immediately after the research
is produced (and thus occurs in the production phase);
in later turns, upgrading is no longer possible. Upgrading a factory does not cost any goods.
After upgrading, the new factory may build a transporter of the new type in the same production turn.
After the upgrade, it is not possible to produce the old
type of transporters at that factory anymore.
Only transporter factories can be upgraded. The transporters themselves cannot be upgraded, nor can mines
be upgraded. New transporters will have to be produced
in the transporter factory. The contents of mines
change by production and shaft building only.

CONFLICT
CONFLICT
N most cases, all players play simultaneously.
However, on some occasions a player may want
to perform an action before or after another player, so
that conflict arises. In that case it is necessary to determine a playing sequence.

Other types of conflict do not occur. It is impossible
under any circumstances to take goods from somebody
else's transporter, to destroy other player's transporters
or to destroy buildings, roads or bridges already present.

CONFLICT
three players, only slot 1, 2 and 3 are used. After the first
player has chosen his position, the other players take
turns in choosing their positions, the player who is
closest to the temple choosing last.
After all players have chosen their positions, play proceeds in the order indicated by the playing sequence
chart.
For an example of a conflict round, see the next page.

CHOOSING A PLAYING SEQUENCE
At the beginning of each phase, every player may
declare that he wants the sequence of play to be determined. If no player wants this, all may play
simultaneously. If conflicts arise after the phase has already started, use the order as indicated on the sequence chart, the player on position one playing first.
In the production phase, determine what will be produced by the mines before determining the order of
play.
All players have a praying figure, lined up in front of the
temple. The figure closest to the temple is said to be in
front of the row. The order of the praying figures
corresponds to the order in which players may choose
when to play. People close to the temple are busy
praying, and are thus late in attending to mundane,
wordly matters like playing sequences. However, they
may invoke the favour of the gods to alter this state of
affairs.
A sequence of play is determined in two steps. First,
players may decide either to keep praying or to “cash in”
their piety. Starting from the player whose praying
figure is closest to the temple, all players have the option
to move their praying figure to the back of the row. If
more than one player chooses to do so in the same
phase, the player whose praying figure was closest to
temple originally now becomes the last player in the
row.
Second, each player chooses a playing position. The
player whose praying figure is furthest from the temple
may start. He puts his sequence marker on the sequence
chart at whatever slot he prefers. Note that the number
of slots corresponds to the number of players, i.e. with

CONFLICT
EXAMPLE OF A CONFLICT ROUND
Production

See Figure 1 on next page - Figure a shows
the row at the temple.
Both mines produce gold. Blue declares he wants the
order of play to be determined.
Starting from Red, each player has the chance to stop
praying. Red decides to be pious. Blue, however, stops
praying and moves his praying figure to the back of the
row (fig. b). It is of no use to Yellow to stop praying as he
was last in the row at the beginning of the turn.

last, Blue cannot predict which mine will be closed off,
and therefore cannot prevent it. Blue moves a donkey
with two boards to A. The donkey on the mine stays
there and the third Blue donkey moves to the second
mine.
Yellow moves the donkey with two stones to mine 2. Yellow's other donkeys stay put.
Building

Blue chooses to play first; Yellow then chooses to play
second and Red plays last (fig. c).

The order of play does not matter, so players agree to
build at the same time. Yellow builds walls at the dashmarked spots. The other players cannot build anything
due to lack of goods.

Blue gets the gold at mine 1 and the pile of trunks at the
woodcutter.

Wonder

At the sawmill, both Yellow and Blue can hand in
trunks and get boards in return, to a maximum of six
sets of boards between the two of them. Blue plays first
and has his pile of trunks cut into two sets of boards.
Yellow has two piles of trunks cut into four sets of
boards. The factory has now produced its full capacity of
six sets; therefore Yellow cannot have his third pile of
trunks cut.
At the quarry, Yellow gets the stone; there is no other
transporter there.
The papermill can only produce one paper each turn
and will do so for Yellow, since Yellow plays before Red.
Only if Yellow does not use the mill, can Red use it.
Movement (Figure 2)

Conflict arises again. This time it is Red that wants an
order of play to be determined.
Starting from Red, each player has the chance to stop
praying. Red decides to do so and moves his praying
figure to the back of the row. Yellow wants to keep
praying. Blue started the phase at the end of the row,
and thus has no options (fig. d).
Starting from Red, each player may now choose when to
play. Red chooses to move first; Blue then chooses to
play second and Yellow plays last (fig. e).
Red moves first and takes the gold piece at mine 2.
Blue only has two boards and does not know whether to
take them to A or to B. Yellow threatens to build walls
to close off either mine 1 or 2, but as Yellow will move

No one buys wonder bricks. A neutral brick is placed

he game ends as soon as the wonder has been

Conflict Example
(1) Before Production
(2) After Movement

These items must be in your possession! That is: they must
be on a transporter. Objects lying on a tile unattended
do not count towards wealth points.
Wealth points are also awarded for bricks in the
wonder. Each row in the wonder scores 10 points; these
are divided evenly among all players' bricks on that row.
If a player's total on a row is not a whole number, it is
rounded down. The last row of the wonder scores 10
points too, even if it is incomplete.

Example: There are six players bricks on the row. Blue scores
2 x 10/6 = 3 points (3 1/3, rounded down), the red player
scores 3 x 10/6 = 5 points, and Yellow scores 1 x 10/6 = 1
point (1 2/3, rounded down). The neutral (white) brick
does not influence the score in any way.

Instead of calculating, you can use the table on the back
cover to determine the scoring of wonder rows.
BREAKING TIES
In case of a tie, the tied player whose praying figure is
closest to the temple wins the game.

						               													<description>In Roads &amp;amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.&amp;#10;For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp;amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;amp;cetera expansion: Roads &amp; Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
