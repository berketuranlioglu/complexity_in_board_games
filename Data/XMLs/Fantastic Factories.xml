SETUP

SAM

Terminology: Dice represent the workers in your factories. Throughout these rules, the terms
“worker” and “workers” are synonymous with “die” and “dice”.
The player who used a tool most recently receives the ﬁrst player token. Shuﬄe the
blueprint and contractor decks separately.
To start the game, each player chooses a color (not white) and begins with:
·
·
·
·
·

4 dice matching their player color
A Headquarters player board
A player aid card (“Legend” on one side and “Each Round” on the other side)
1 metal resource and 2 energy resources
4 random blueprint cards as their starting hand of cards

First Player Token

The area of the table in front of each player is their compound where they will build factories and other
cards throughout the game. Players may look at their hand but should keep it hidden from others.
Deal 4 random blueprints and 4 random contractors face up onto the table (see diagram on opposite
page). Place a tool label token above each face up contractor card. The order of the tools does not
matter but must remain the same for the rest of the game. These 8 revealed cards form the
marketplace. Place the metal, energy, goods tokens and white dice (used when extra dice are needed
beyond your 4 colored dice) on the table within reach of all players to form the supply.
Unlimited Supply: There is no limit to the number of resources and dice available to players. If the
supply runs out, use some other means to keep track.

OBJECTIVE
The goal is to earn as many points as possible. Points can be earned in two ways:
prestige ( ) and goods ( ). Each card in your compound is worth the prestige value
printed on its top right corner. Additionally, production factories can manufacture
goods that you accumulate throughout the game. Your total score is the number of
goods you have + your total prestige.

PLAYING THE GAME

ODUCTION

Each round consists of two phases. During the market phase, players take turns drafting a card from
the marketplace. After all players have drafted, the work phase begins. During the work phase, all
players simultaneously roll their dice, place their dice as workers, and build cards.

MARKET PHASE
In the market phase players take turns in order, starting with the player with the ﬁrst player token and
then continuing clockwise. On your turn you must choose one of two options:
A. Gain a blueprint card. Choose 1 of the 4 blueprints in the marketplace and put it in your hand
for free. Reﬁll the marketplace with the top card from the blueprint deck.
Tip: When choosing a blueprint card, look for cards you are interested in building or cards
that have the same tool symbol (
/
/
/
) as a card in your hand that you want to
build. (See "Building Cards” in the “Work Phase” section for more information.)
OR
B. Hire a contractor. Choose 1 of the 4 contractors in the marketplace to hire. To hire a
contractor you must discard a blueprint from your hand with the same tool symbol as the
token above the contractor. Execute the instructions written on the contractor
card then immediately discard it. Reﬁll the marketplace with the top card from
the contractor deck.
Some contractors will have an additional cost beyond discarding a blueprint.
When applicable, this additional cost is shown on the top left corner of the card.

2

FORE

Additional Cost

Optional action: Before choosing a blueprint or contractor, the
active player may pay 1 metal OR 1 energy resource to discard
either all the blueprints or all the contractors (but not both) in the marketplace and reveal 4 new
cards from the corresponding deck. Each player can do this once per turn. This can be useful if you
don’t like any of the choices or want to eliminate cards that may be important to other players.
Once all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins.

WORK PHASE
During the work phase, all players take their turns simultaneously. However, if there are any players
learning the rules for the ﬁrst time, we recommend taking turns one at a time for the ﬁrst round or two.
The work phase begins with everyone picking up their dice and rolling them. Players then (in any order)
build cards, place workers, and activate cards.

BUILDING CARDS
To build a card in your hand, you must pay the build cost as
indicated on the top left corner: Discard another blueprint card
with the same tool symbol (
/
/
/
) from your hand and
also pay the indicated resource cost (
and/or
).

BASIC ACTIONS
Each player has a Headquarters player board with three basic actions available: Research, Generate,
and Mine. To use one of these basic actions, place a worker in an available slot on your board and
immediately execute that action, as described below.

+2 EXTRA

Research

HEADQUARTERS
RESEARCH

For each worker you place on the Research ﬂoor, draw one
blueprint card from the top of the blueprint deck. Any value worker
may be used, and the value of the worker does not matter.
Drawing Cards: Whenever you draw a card during the work
phase for any reason, you must draw from the top of the
deck. You may not draw cards from the marketplace.

GENERATE

MATCH Bonus:

If any deck runs out of cards, shuﬄe the discard pile to reﬁll
the deck.

MINE

For each worker you place on the Generate ﬂoor, you take energy
resources equal to the value of the worker (i.e. the number on the
die face). The value of the worker must be
,
, or
.
Mine
For each worker you place on the Mine, you take 1 metal resource
from the supply. The value of the worker must be
,
, or
.

Note: Mine and Generate produce resources in diﬀerent quantities! Mine will only produce 1 metal
resource per worker while Generate may produce multiple energy resources per worker depending
on the value used.

5

MATCHING BONUS
With the basic actions in your Headquarters, if the worker you are placing matches another placed
worker on the same basic action, you gain an extra card or resource corresponding to that action. If all
three of your placed workers match, the bonus is two extra instead. The dice do not have to be placed
all at the same time in order to get the matching bonus.

ACTIVATING CARDS
Once you’ve built a card into your compound, you may activate it—even on the same turn you built it!
The recipe for activating a card is printed on the lower portion of the card using symbols. If you pay
everything on the left side of the arrow then you gain everything on the right side in return. Some cards
require workers to activate in which case you place the required workers on the card. You can refer to
the Legend player aid card to see what each symbol means.

UTILITY

Activation Limit: Each card can only be activated once per turn. If
the card has no worker slots, sometimes it can be unclear whether
the card has already been activated. You can choose to indicate a
card has been activated by pushing the card up slightly from the
other cards in your compound.

6

Activation Order: Cards can be
activated in any order as long as you
can meet the activation requirements.
The output is gained immediately,
which can help you activate other
cards or build more cards.

Worker Placement: You cannot use the same
worker for multiple actions. Each worker can only
be used once per turn. At the end of the work
phase, leave your workers placed on the cards so
other players can see you are ﬁnished and also
how you played your turn.

Accumulating Goods: It is recommended that the goods you gain are placed on
the card that manufactured them. This allows players to see which cards are being
utilized. Players can freely exchange equivalent value goods tokens with the supply
at any time.

ENDING THE WORK PHASE

2

2

Once all players have placed all their workers and completed all their actions, they must discard down
to 12 total resources (metal and energy resources combined) and 10 cards in hand. The work phase is
now complete. Pass the ﬁrst player token to the next player clockwise and a new round starts again with
the market phase.

GAME END
Once any player has manufactured 12 or more goods or has built 10 or more buildings in their
compound, the game end is triggered. Players ﬁnish the current round and then one more round is
played (market phase + work phase). A reminder of the end condition is printed on the player aid card:

GAME END :

12

OR

10

+1

Important Note: Triggering the end of the game with 12 or more goods refers only to the goods
tokens that have been manufactured. This does not include the prestige value of buildings.
Also, once a player has 10 or more buildings in their compound, the game end is triggered
regardless of the prestige value of those buildings.
Once the game ends, each player adds the number of goods they
manufactured + the amount of prestige on buildings in their compound to
calculate their ﬁnal score. The player with the highest score is the winner!
In the event of a tie, the tie breaker is determined ﬁrst by the player with the most metal resources,
then by most energy resources, and ﬁnally by most blueprints in hand. If there is still a tie, the tied
players rejoice in their shared victory.

SOLO RULES
In Solo Mode, you play against a basic simulated opponent called “The Machine”. Rather than choosing
a set of colored dice to use, you must use 4 white dice.

SETUP
Set up the game as normal for one player. Then deal out a number of blueprints face up to form the
The Machine’s starting compound. The number of blueprints depends on how diﬃcult you want your
opponent to be:
Diﬃculty

# of starting cards

Easy

2

Medium

3

Hard

4

If any of the dealt cards are Monument type cards (with a gray banner), discard them and continue
dealing until The Machine has the desired number of cards that are all non-Monument cards. The
Machine may build Monument cards later in the game but cannot begin with any in play.
The Machine’s Compound: The Machine’s
compound is always grouped by card
type/color (production, utility, training,
special, and monument).

Then discard all contractors (

After performing The Machine’s action, reﬁll the marketplace.

WORK PHASE
Check the values of the remaining red, blue, purple, and yellow dice to determine if The Machine
manufactures any goods, according to the rules below.
Each colored die corresponds to a card type:
·
·
·
·

The red die corresponds to the red Training type cards.
The blue die corresponds to the blue Production type cards.
The purple die corresponds to the purple Special type cards.
The yellow die corresponds to the yellow Utility type cards.

For each die, if the value is lower than or equal to the number of corresponding cards in The Machine’s
compound, then The Machine manufactures a good. Note that as The Machine’s compound grows, they
become increasingly more likely to manufacture goods each work phase.

As a player, you trigger the game end the same as in a normal game (reminder: 12 goods or 10 cards in
your compound). However, the Machine may only trigger the end of the game by manufacturing 12 or
more goods. Once the game end is triggered, both the player and the Machine play one more round.

SCORING
Calculate your own score the same way as in a normal game (reminder: goods + prestige). To calculate
The Machine’s score, they receive 1 point for each of their goods, 1 point for each card in their
compound (regardless of prestige value), and 1 additional point for each Monument type card in their
compound. If you have more points than The Machine, you win!

)

Draw and reveal a blueprint. Gain metal and energy equal to the
build cost of that blueprint. The resources you gain are an exact
combination of the metal and energy cost of the revealed card. For
example, if the card costs 2 metal and 1 energy, you will gain 2 metal
and 1 energy. In the case of a card with cost discount rules (e.g.
Megalith), you gain the full cost without applying any discounts.

Miner (2x)
INVESTOR

Gain 3 metal and pick an opponent to gain 1 metal.

Specialist (3x)

Gain an extra die of any value during the next work phase. You may
roll your other dice ﬁrst and then decide the value of the extra die.
Discard the extra die at the end of the round.

COMMON MISTAKES
RESEARCH & MINE VS GENERATE

Without a match bonus, each worker on Mine or Research will only gain you 1 metal or blueprint
regardless of value. However, Generate works diﬀerently and will gain you energy equal to the
value of the worker. Note that
is the largest value you can place on Generate.

MARKETPLACE BLUEPRINTS

During the market phase, players are not allowed to draw a blueprint from the deck. If they do not like
the choices available to them, they must pay 1 resource (metal or energy) to reﬁll the marketplace.

GAME END

Any player can trigger the end of the game by having 12+ goods or 10+ cards in their compound. Note
that prestige ( ) is worth points but is irrelevant to meeting either end condition. Once any player
meets either condition, there is still one additional round (market + work phase) afterwards.

TIPS & STRATEGIES
It is recommended that you play Fantastic Factories once or twice to discover your own strategies before reading this section. For
players looking to master the game, these tips, tricks, and suggested strategies may improve your play.

WAIT TO BUILD

MARKETPLACE MATTERS

Since you can build as many cards as you want each round
and can also activate those cards on the same turn you build
them, waiting to build a card until you actually need to use it
will allow you to save your cards/resources in case a better
opportunity arises.

1’s only generate 1 energy. Unless you really need that
energy, it is usually more eﬃcient to use that worker to draw a
blueprint card.

Pay attention to what strategies other players are utilizing. For
example, the Replicator allows players to copy a card in the
marketplace. You might consider refreshing the blueprints in
the marketplace depending on whether you or an opponent
has the Replicator and how useful the cards are in the
marketplace. The same tip applies to Black Market. And if any
player is seeking to build Beacons, it would be wise to keep
the marketplace clear of any Beacons. On the other hand, if
you are looking for Beacons, you might refresh the
marketplace each turn until you ﬁnd one.

DRAW FIRST, DRAW OFTEN

END GAME PRODUCTION

RESEARCH WITH 1’s

Some production factories manufacture 2 goods at a time.
These factories have a heavy resource costs or diﬃcult-to-roll
conditions. They can play an important role to winning the
game but require supporting cards before they can be used
eﬃciently or reliably. You should generally avoid building
these cards early on until you have the necessary supporting
cards.

If you know you need to draw cards during the work phase,
do it early in your turn so you have as much information up
front as possible. Keeping your hand full of cards also grants
you ﬂexibility to hire diﬀerent contractors during the market
phase.

GOLEM SYNERGY

MONUMENTS FOR THE WIN

Golem is a powerful card that has many uses that may not be
immediately apparent. For example, each round you can pay
1 energy to gain a 1 that you can use to research and draw a
blueprint. You can also gain 1 extra energy using the Golem
worker if you are able to get a matching bonus on Generate.
Golem also has excellent synergy with Biolab and Concrete
Plant.

Once you assemble an eﬃcient goods manufacturing engine,
you may ﬁnd yourself with excess resources and no useful
cards to build. If you know you have all the pieces of your
engine in hand, you can focus on picking up cheaper
monument cards like Obelisks that will help you close out the
game with extra prestige.

						               													<description>It's a manufacturing arms race! Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time. You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique. Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more. This puzzle collection can be found in the BGG Play-By-Forum area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
