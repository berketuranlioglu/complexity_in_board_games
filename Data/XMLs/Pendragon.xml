Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

1.0 Introduction
Pendragon is a board game about the fall of the Roman Diocese
of Britain, from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and
Saxon raiders to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both
Celtic and Germanic. It adapts GMT Games’ “COIN Series”
game system about asymmetrical conflicts to depict the political,
military, religious, and economic affairs of 5th Century Britain.
In Pendragon, one to four players each take the roles of one or more
Factions in Britain: the post-Roman army in Britain seeking to
maintain imperial order and perhaps morphing into warlords; the
landholding civilian aristocracy of the Romanized Celtic Briton
tribes aiming to recover their independence while preserving
their lands and wealth, the Germanic peoples (Saxons proper,
Angles, Jutes, and others) threatening Britain as they look for
new opportunities across the North Sea, and the non-Romanized
Celtic peoples from across the Irish Sea or from the cold North
(mainly Irishmen and Caledonian Picts) eying the disintegrating
provinces with appetite.

•	 58 Stronghold “castles” (10 red [Forts], 15 light blue [Towns], 15
medium blue [Hillforts], 6 green [Scotti Settlements], 12 black
[Saxon Settlements]) (1.4)
•	 Eight Faction round cylinders (2 red, 2 blue, 2 green, 2 black; 1.8,
2.2)
•	 12 pawns (1 red, 1 blue, 6 white, 4 gray; 1.9, 3.1.1)
•	 A sheet of markers
•	 Four Faction player aid foldouts (3.0. 4.0, 7.0)
•	 Two Epoch and Battles sheets (2.0, 3.6, 6.0)
•	 A Non-Player Guidelines Summary and Battle Tactics sheet
(8.1-.4, 8.4.2)
•	 A Non-Player Event Instructions foldout (8.2.1)
•	 A Non-player flowchart foldout (8.5-8.8)
•	 Three four-sided dice (gray) and four six-sided dice (red, blue,
black, and green)
•	 A background play book
•	 This rule book
NOTE: Several extra wood pieces have been provided for use as spares.

1.3 Game Board and Map
The game board shows a map of late-Roman Britain and environs
divided into Region, City, and Sea spaces, with several tracks
around the edge and within spaces.

Issuing commands and exploiting their Factions’ special actions
and various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence
or control the populations of Britain, extract resources and build
renown, and achieve their Factions’ aims. Cards regulate turn
order, events, and victory checks.

The game’s most important functions are summarized on several
aid sheets. The last few pages of this rule book list key terms in
an index and explain how to set up. New players should start with
the tutorial in the Playbook.

1.1 General Course of Play

Available
Forces

In Pendragon, cards are played from the deck one at time, with
one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event card shows
the order in which the Factions become Eligible to choose either
that Event or from a menu of Commands and Feats. Executing
an Event or Command renders that Faction Ineligible to do so
on the next card. Epoch cards mixed in with the Event cards
provide periodic opportunities for instant wins and activities such
as collecting resources.

1.2 Components
A complete set of Pendragon includes the following:
•	 A 22” x 34” game board (1.3)
•	 A deck of 83 playing cards (5.0)
•	 90 golden Prosperity/Plunder cubes (1.7)
•	 102 Troop cubes (20 red [Cavalry], 30 light blue [Militia], 15
medium blue [Comitates], 12 green [Scotti Warbands], 25 black
[Saxon Warbands]) (1.4)
•	 55 Raider triangular cylinders (30 green [Scotti], 25 black [Saxon])
(1.4)

City
Sea

1.3.1 Regions. Borders delineate Regions of the map. Each
Region features the name of its main Briton tribe, two Stronghold Sites (1.3.5), and one of three terrain types: Clear, Fens, or

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
Hills. Terrain affects Battle (3.6) and certain Events (5.0). Region
also show a Population value (1.3.6) and have holding boxes for
Control markers (1.6) and Prosperity cubes (1.7).
1.3.2 Cities. Two map spaces, Londinium and Eboracum, are Cities. They have only one Stronghold Site (a Town Site that cannot
hold a Hillfort) and follow a different Control rule (1.6). They
also show Population values and have Prosperity holding boxes.
1.3.3 Roads. A Road network is superimposed on the map,
running through and linking several Regions and both Cities.
Briton Units can move along these Roads during March (3.2.2,
3.3.2) and Intercept (3.2.3) Commands as long as the Roads are
Maintained (6.6.1, 6.8.4).
NOTE: Roads are not spaces. Their benefit applies only if moving along
connected Roads. For example, movement from Corieltauvi to Dobunni is
along a Road, from Corieltauvi directly to Cornovii is not.
1.3.4 Adjacency. Any two spaces (Regions or Cities) sharing a
border (not just a corner) are adjacent. Roads run through spaces
and do not affect adjacency (1.3.3).
NOTE: Silures and Durotriges Regions are not adjacent to each other, nor
is Trinovantes to Cantiaci.
1.3.5 Stronghold Sites. Each Region has two Stronghold Sites,
and each City has one. Each Site is either a Town Site or a Hillfort
Site. Strongholds may occupy Sites only, one Stronghold per
Site. Towns may occupy Town Sites only. Hillforts, Forts, and
Settlements may occupy either type of Site (1.4.2).
EXCEPTION: Hillforts are not allowed in Cities.
NOTE: Town Sites have names in white on dark gray.
1.3.6 Population. Each Region and City has a Population number. Feats or Events (4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 5.0)
can add or subtract to a Region’s Population, but never
below 0 or beyond its printed Population plus one. Cities’ Populations never increase, but can drop. Use markers to show
changed Population values. Regions subject to the Tears Of
Epona Event show a tear symbol.
DESIGN NOTE: A Population of “0” does not mean that the area is
entirely empty of people, simply that the population has dropped so low as
to make the area insignificant in manpower, economic, and political terms.
•	

Refugees: Whenever the Population of a Region
or City actually drops, put one Refugees marker
in the Civitates Available Forces box, unless a
specific Event instruction says differently.

NOTE. The Civitates Rule Feat (4.3.1) can only add Population to a Region
if a Refugees marker is available. There are only four Refugees marker in
the game: when all four are in play, no more may be added. Refugees are not
Population (until added to a Region) and do not count for Briton Control or
any game total.
1.3.7 Seas. Four Sea spaces border the island of
Britain. Seas can be either Patrolled or not (by Setup,
2.1, or Event, 5.0) and affect origins and strengths
of Raids and Marches (3.4.1, 3.5.1, 3.4.3. 3.5.3).

3

1.3.8 Coasts. Any space sharing a border with a Sea is Coastal to
that Sea. Some Regions are Coastal to two Seas.
NOTE: Dobunni Region does not border on Oceanus Hibernicus and is not
Coastal. Londinium is Coastal on Oceanus Germanicus.
1.3.9 Caledonia: Caledonia is an area from which Raids can
originate (3.5.1) but which holds no pieces (1.4.2).

1.4 Forces
Wooden pieces represent the Factions’ forces, either Units—
Troops or Raiders—or Strongholds:
•	 Dux Troops are Cavalry (red cubes), and their Strongholds are
Forts (red castles).
•	 Civitates Troops are Militia (light blue cubes) and Comitates
(medium blue cubes), and their Strongholds are either Towns
(light blue castles) or Hillforts (medium blue castles).
•	 Barbarian Troops are Warbands (black cubes for Saxons, green
for Scotti), and their Strongholds are Settlements (black castles
for Saxons, green for Scotti). Other Barbarian Units are Raiders
(black triangular cylinders for Saxons, green for Scotti).
NOTE: See also Foederati (1.4.3)—Barbarian pieces in Briton employ can
count as Dux or Civitates Forces.
1.4.1 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. Each Faction (1.5)
has an Available Forces box showing its inventory of forces pieces,
including spots for its Strongholds. These Force pools limit the
number of pieces that a Faction may have in play. Keep a Faction’s
forces not on the map in its Available Forces box. Place Available
Strongholds in the highest-numbered empty spots, revealing the
number of on-map Strongholds to help track earnings, upkeep,
victory, and so on (6.5, 6.6, 7.2).
•	 Placement: Pieces may be placed from or replaced with those
in the Available Forces boxes only (not from other holding
boxes). A piece to be replaced by a piece that is not Available
is simply removed.
•	 Removal: When removing pieces from the map, put them in
their Available Forces boxes (EXCEPTION: Cavalry Casualties).
•	 Cavalry: Put Cavalry Units removed during Battle into their
Casualties box instead of Available. Cavalry pieces can go Out
of Play (a separate holding box) via Epoch Round Upkeep
(6.6.1) or Event (5.0).
•	 Comitates: Most scenarios begin with all or most Comitates
pieces in a holding box, Not Yet in Play (2.1). Comitates enter
the Civitates Available Forces box or the map via Events (5.0).
Important—Voluntary removal: A Faction while executing
a Command, Feat, or Event to place its own Units may take
such Units (Troop or Raider pieces in that Faction’s color, not
Strongholds) from the map into Available only if the appropriate type is not Available. Britons may so remove Foederati with
their color marker (only) of the Nation to be placed (1.4.3).
Barbarians may not so remove Foederati. (Dux may voluntarily
remove Forts during Epoch Round Upkeep, 6.6).

NOTE: The Patrolled or No Patrol status of Seas is set by scenario (2.1)
and may change via Events (5.0).

1.4.2 Stacking. Any pieces may occupy a space, except:
•	 Towns may occupy only Town Sites, one per Site.
•	 Hillforts, Forts, and Settlements may occupy Town or Hillfort
Sites, one per Site (1.3.5). NOTE: Hillforts thus may occupy Town
Sites, except in Cities.
•	 No pieces may occupy Seas or Caledonia (1.3.7, 1.3.9).
Important—Unless otherwise specified, a Faction placing a
Stronghold via Command (3.0), Feat (4.0) or Event (5.1) must
place it in a valid vacant Site; if via an Event (only), if no such
Site is vacant, the Faction may select and replace an existing
Stronghold in a valid Site.
1.4.3 Foederati. Barbarian Warbands and
Settlements may be in the employ of either
the Dux or Civitates Faction. Place a Foederati marker—red for Dux or blue for Civitates—on such Warbands and Settlements to show their Foederati status. Foederati
pieces are considered pieces of the employing Faction (Dux or
Civitates), not of their original Faction, in all aspects (such as for
Control, 1.6, and Commands, 3.0) unless otherwise specified for
their Saxon or Scotti Nationality (see Home Terrain in Battle,
3.6.1, and victory, 7.2, for example).

1.5 Players and Factions
Up to four players can play Pendragon, each as one or more
Factions: the Dux (red – post-Roman Army), the Civitates (blue
– Briton lords), the Saxons (black – Germanic peoples), or the
Scotti (green – non-Romanized Celts).
•	 The Dux and Civitates Factions are “Britons”, and (except at
Fragmentation of the Imperium, 6.8) share Control (1.6) and
Resources (1.8.1).
•	 The Saxon and Scotti Factions are “Barbarians”.
•	 All Factions are “enemy” to all others. EXCEPTION: Before
Fragmentation (6.8), Dux and Civitates are Friendly to one another
unless fighting each other in Battle (3.6).
1.5.1 Spare Factions. With two or three players, the players run
leftover Factions:
•	 With three players, one player runs the Saxons and Scotti.
•	 With two players, one player runs the Dux and Civitates, the
other the Saxons and Scotti.
A player running two Factions uses the lower victory margin of
the two (7.1-7.3) and only causes play to end on a victory check
(6.3) if both Factions are meeting their conditions.
Non-Player Option: If playing solitaire, or as an alternative to
the above with two or three players, use the Non-player rules
in section 8 to govern leftover Factions.
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. All negotiations are open. Once a player agrees
to something within the execution of a Command, Feat, Event,
or Epoch Round, that agreement is binding during that action
only. The rules do not otherwise bind players to agreements. In
general, assets such as Resources, Renown (1.8), or Plunder (1.7.4)
may not be transferred between Factions. However—

•	 Army Preemption. Under Roman Rule and under Autonomy
with Military Dominance (per the Imperium track, 6.8.2), the
Dux Faction may spend Briton Resources (blue cylinder; not
Wealth, 1.8.4) for Commands, Feats, Annona, and Upkeep or
transfer them to Barbarians as if they were Dux Resources.
•	 Briton Cooperation, No Preemption. At Autonomy with
Civilian Dominance only, Dux may so spend blue Briton
Resources only with Civitates agreement. (At Fragmentation
it may not do so, 6.8.2.)
•	Tribute. A Briton Faction may transfer any of its Resources to
a Barbarian Faction during either’s execution by the Sequence
of Play (2.3.4) of a Command, Feat, or Event. Such Resources
are converted to Renown 1 for 1. The Civitates Faction may so
transfer Wealth (1.8.4) to another Faction, converting to Dux
Resources or Barbarian Renown 1 for 1. (It cannot directly
transform Resources into Wealth.)

1.6 Control
A Faction Controls a Region if it has a Stronghold there and its
Troop and Stronghold pieces (not Raiders) outnumber those of
all other Factions combined. Foederati pieces count for their
employing (marked) Faction (1.4.3).
•	 Raiders never count for or affect Control (but can affect
requirements for certain Command and Feat actions).
•	 A Faction Controls a City if it has a Stronghold there (regardless
of other pieces).
1.6.1 Briton Cooperation. Except under Fragmentation (6.8), Civitates and Dux (including Foederati,
1.4.3) add together to determine Briton Control, and
Briton Control is “Friendly Control” to the Dux.
Under Fragmentation, “Briton Control” means Control by the
Civitates Faction, and Dux Control is assessed separately.
NOTE: Unlike in other COIN Series volumes, a Faction must have a
Stronghold in a space to Control it, and Raider pieces are ignored for Control.

1.7 Prosperity & Plunder
Each space at any given moment holds an amount of Prosperity
(small gold cubes), possibly 0. Keep unused gold cubes off to
the side of the game board.
1.7.1 Regional Prosperity. Each Region may start with up to
twice its current Population (1.3.6) in Prosperity. Put a Region’s
Prosperity cubes into the two rows of squares in the space. When
adding Prosperity, begin at the bottom row, left to right; once this
row holds Prosperity equal to the Region’s current Population,
add any further Prosperity to the top row, without exceeding
Population in either row. When removing Prosperity (such as via
Raid, 1.7.4, 3.4.1, 3.5.1), reverse that order: begin on the top row
and remove from the bottom row only once the top row is empty.
Epoch Round Recovery at Imperium Autonomy or Fragmentation
adds Prosperity only to the bottom row (6.7, 6.8.6).
NOTE: No Prosperity cube is removed or added at the time of a change
in the Population of a Region subsequent to a Feat or an Event effect; any
excess cube following a Population reduction would be removed during the next
Recovery Phase (6.7.1).

Top row
Bottom row

1.8.3 Dux Prestige. The Dux Faction gains or loses
Prestige via Battle consequences (3.6.5), Events (5.0,
6.4), and Revenue (6.5.1). Prestige affects Dux
victory (7.2, 7.3) and Dominance (6.2.2). Track
Prestige on the edge track with its round red marker.

Open boxes
for Pop +1

NOTE: Prosperity will be added to the rightmost, open box of each row only
when Population is at printed Pop +1.
1.7.2 City Prosperity. Cities have only one Prosperity row and
can hold twice their printed Population in Prosperity. A Barbarian
Faction that destroys a City’s Stronghold in Battle (3.6) immediately Plunders all its Prosperity (1.7.4).
1.7.3 Total Prosperity. The number of all Prosperity cubes in the map’s Regions and Cities equals
“Total Prosperity” (do not count Plunder cubes on
Units). Total Prosperity can affect Dux victory (1.9,
7.2-7.3).
1.7.4 Plunder. “Plundering” a space means taking Prosperity
cubes from that Region or City (1.7.1-1.7.2) and putting them
onto Raiders or Troops there; those and any other gold cubes
carried by Units are Plunder cubes (no longer Prosperity). Raid
(3.4.1, 3.5.1) and many other actions result in Plunder. Return
(3.4.2, 3.5.2) and other actions or Epoch phases convert Plunder
into Renown, Resources, or Wealth.
Important—Units may carry one Plunder cube each. Cavalry
may carry Plunder only from a Retaliate Feat (4.2.4) or Event.
The executing Faction decides which candidate Units in a
space receive new Plunder. A Faction may not shift Plunder
among Units.

1.8 Resources, Renown, Prestige, & Wealth
At any moment, each Briton Faction has between 0 and 80
Resources and each Barbarian Faction between 0 and 80 Renown
that they spend to pay for Commands or Feats (3.0, 4.0). Dux
has between 0 and 80 Prestige. Civitates have between 0 and 80
Wealth. Mark Resources and Renown along the 0-80 board edge
track with a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) and Prestige
and Wealth with round markers. Ignore any drop below 0 or rise
above 80 in these totals.
1.8.1 Briton Resources. The Civitates Faction’s
Resources (tracked with a blue cylinder) are called
“Briton Resources”.
NOTE: The Dux Faction often will draw on Briton Resources rather than
Dux Resources—see 1.5.2, 6.8.2. Dux can accrue Dux Resources (red
cylinder) at any Imperium via Requisition Feat (4.2.3) or Event (5.0) and
at Fragmentation (only) via Epoch Revenue (6.5.1). See also Passing (2.3.3).
1.8.2 Barbarian Renown. Barbarian Factions earn and spend
Renown instead of Resources.

5

1.8.4 Civitates Wealth. The Civitates can convert
Briton (blue) Resources or Plunder (1.7.4) into
Wealth. Track Wealth on the edge track with its
round blue marker. Wealth is needed for Muster
and Upkeep of Comitates Units and Muster of Towns (3.3.1,
6.6.2) and affects Dominance (6.2.2). (See also transfer of Wealth
to Resources or Renown, 1.5.2). Civitates may at any time spend
(pay) Wealth as if Briton Resources, and they must do so if called
upon to spend Resources but Briton Resources are at 0.
EXCEPTION: Imperial Taxation (6.5.3, 6.8.3) takes Briton Resources
but never affects Wealth.

1.9 Victory Markers and Pawns
Use markers on the edge track as follows to show various totals
that affect victory (7.0). NOTE: Colored, labeled bands along the track
show Victory thresholds (7.2).
•	
Dux victory – Track Prestige (1.8.3)
with the round “Dux Prestige”
marker. Under Roman Rule and
Autonomy (6.8), track Total
Prosperity (1.7.3) with the “Total
Prosp” marker and the sum of
Prestige and Total Prosperity with
the red “Prosper + Prestige”
victor y marker. Under
Fragmentation, flip “Total Prosp.” to “Dux Control” and
“Prosper + Prestige” to “Control + Prestige” and instead track
Dux Controlled Population and the sum of Dux Control and
Prestige with those markers. Mark the current Dux victory
threshold (6.8.7, 7.2.1) along the edge track with the red pawn.
•	
Civitates victory – Track total Population under
Briton Control (under Fragmentation, meaning
Civitates Control, 1.6) with the blue “Briton
Control” victory marker. Mark the current
Civitates victory threshold (6.8.7, 7.2.2) along the edge track
with the blue pawn.
•	
Saxon victory – Track total Population under
Saxon Control with the black “Saxon Control”
victory marker. Before Fragmentation, the
position of the black Saxon Renown cylinder (1.8)
also bears on Saxon victory (7.2.3).
Scotti victory – The position of the green Scotti
•	
Renown cylinder (1.8) shows Scotti victory.
NOTE: Scotti victory (7.2) may also require a certain total of
the Scotti Nation’s Settlements on the map (including Foederati)—a total shown
by the highest number visible in the Scotti Available Forces display (1.4.1).

DESIGN NOTE: Renown represents the fame of leaders, chiefs, or kings
in the Barbarian homelands, determining their ability to attract Raiders
and initiate campaigns.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the
same options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible
Faction Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.6) and play the next card
(2.3.7).

2.0 Sequence Of Play
2.1 Set Up
Follow the instructions at the end of this rule book to choose a
scenario, assign Factions to players, prepare the deck, and set up
pieces, markers, and Prosperity.

Important—If the Dux Passes, add +3 Briton Resources (blue
cylinder) if at Roman Rule or Autonomy (6.8), or add +3 Dux
Resources (red cylinder) if at Fragmentation.

2.2 Start

NOTE: Ineligible Factions may not Pass.

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile face up. Then reveal the next card on
top of the draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played
first; the card on top of the draw deck will be played next.

2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.

NOTE: All players will see one card ahead into the deck (2.3.7). All played
cards and the number of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: After the
steps of each Event card play
are completed, place round
Eligibility cylinders corresponding to the Faction involved (1.5) into appropriate boxes of
the Sequence of Play track. During Epoch Rounds (6.0), place
the Epoch marker in the current phase’s box.

2.3 Event Card
When playing an Event card, up to two Factions will execute a
Command or the Event.
•	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction symbols shown at
top of the card.
•	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute a Command or
Event on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start
the card in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.6). Factions that did are
Ineligible. (All Factions start the game Eligible, 2.1.) See also Free
Actions, 3.1.2 & 5.5.

Faction order

2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost
symbol in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st
Eligible to execute a Command or Event or to Pass. The next
leftmost is the 2nd Eligible.
NOTE: Ignore any gray details around the Faction symbols unless using
Non-player rules (8.2.1).

FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass
(2.3.3), it may execute either:
•	 A Command (3.0)—with or without a Feat (4.0)—or
•	 The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction
does not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute a Command or possibly
the Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
•	 Command Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed a
Command, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited
Command (2.3.5).
•	 Command & Feat: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed a
Command with a Feat, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute
either a Limited Command or the Event.
•	Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd
Eligible Faction may execute a Command, with a Feat if desired.
NOTE: The game board Sequence of Play track also shows these options.
2.3.5 Limited Command. A Limited Command is a Command
selecting just one space, with no Feat (4.0). A Limited Command
counts as a Command.
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Commands, Feats, and Events (or after
all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders on the
Sequence of Play track as follows:
•	 Any Faction that did not execute a Command or Event (and
was not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
•	 Any Faction that executed a Command (including a Limited
Command) or Event to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise
specified by the Event; see also Free Actions, 3.1.2 & 5.5).
2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw
deck’s next card. Play the card which is on top of the played card
pile, per the appropriate sequence.
Important—If the newly revealed card is an Epoch card (2.4),
swap the two cards: the previous card returns face-up onto
the draw deck (to be played after the Epoch card), the Epoch
card goes onto the played card pile face-up, and an Epoch
Round ensues (6.0).

2.3.3 Passing. If a currently 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction opts
to Pass, it remains Eligible for the next card and receives +3
Resources if a Briton Faction or +1 Renown if a Barbarian Faction. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
2.3.8 Pivotal Events. Certain
Factions by scenario setup (2.1)
begin with a Pivotal Event card
unique to them. Pivotal Events are
a type of Event (5.7). A Faction
may play its Pivotal Event to
interrupt a currently played Event
card (including Eligibility order,
2.3) if:
•	That Faction is Eligible (1st,
2nd, or neither), AND
•	Any red pre-condition on the
card is met, AND
•	 The 1st Eligible Faction has not
yet done anything.
PROCEDURE: The Faction interrupts the usual Sequence of
Play by replacing the played Event card by its Pivotal Event card
and executing the Pivotal Event. The new Eligibility sequence
follows, and the Pivotal Event stays in the played card pile, as
normal. The interrupted Event card goes back on top of the draw
deck and will be the next Event card played.
TRUMPING PIVOTAL EVENTS: The Scotti may play their
Pivotal Event on top of another Faction’s Pivotal Event, canceling it; the Saxons may do so to the Dux and Civitates (if the
precondition is met); the Dux may do so to the Civitates; the
Civitates may not do so. A cancelled Pivotal Event card returns
to its owner for later use.
PLAY NOTE: The 1st Eligible Faction need not declare what it would
execute before a Faction must decide whether to play its Pivotal Event.

2.4 Epoch Card
If playing an Epoch Card, conduct
an Epoch Round (6.0), marking
each phase on the Sequence of
Play with the “Epoch” marker.
NOTE: Each series of Event Cards
up to an Epoch Round is called an
“Epoch”.
2.4.1 Epoch Event. During the
Epoch Event Phase of the Epoch
Round (6.4), the Faction(s) noted
in the Event text on the Epoch
card resolve the Epoch Event
(5.6).
2.4.2 Final Epoch. If the last Epoch Card’s Victory Phase (6.3)
is completed without a victory, the game ends anyway: conduct
an immediate Recovery Phase (6.7, unless at Fragmentation, 6.8),
then determine victory by 7.3.
NOTE: The Event of the last Epoch card and the rest of that Epoch Round
do not take place.

3.0 Commands
3.1 Commands in General
A Faction executing a Command chooses one of the four Commands listed on its Faction sheet and selects one or more spaces
to be involved. Select (and mark with pawns, 3.1.1) all spaces to
be involved in all actions before resolving any (Commands and
Feats, 4.0, including spaces where pieces are yet to arrive). Select a
given space only once for a given action. Commands usually cost
Resources or Renown, sometimes Wealth; the executing Faction
must pay those costs up front, upon selection.
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which
the Command is resolved and the Friendly pieces affected or
enemy Faction(s) or pieces targeted. Once targeted, an enemy
Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent possible.
NOTE: Unlike in other COIN Series volumes, players must predesignate spaces before executing actions. Commands that have no results—such as Intercepts
or Battles from which all defending Raiders successfully Evade—still count as
executed Commands for Sequence of Play and addition of Feats (2.3, 4.1).
3.1.1 Pawns. Mark spaces selected for various actions such as
Commands with white pawns and Feats (4.0) with gray pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Actions. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Commands
or Feats: they cost no Resources or Renown and, if executed by
a Faction other than the one playing an Event, do not affect its
Eligibility (2.3.6). Other requirements and procedures still apply
unless modified by Event text (5.1.1, 5.3, 5.4).
PLAY NOTE: Refer to the Faction foldouts during play and to the following
rules sections only as questions arise.

3.2 Dux Commands
The Dux Faction chooses from Train, March, Intercept, and Battle Commands.
3.2.1 Train. Training places Dux Cavalry and/or Civitates Militia
Units from Available Forces and can improve local Prosperity.
Select any spaces that have a Fort (red Stronghold, 1.4) or Dux
Control (Briton Control before Fragmentation, 1.6). Select just
one such space if this is a Limited Command (2.3.5).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, pay 3 Resources (1.8.1)
per space to place up to 1 Cavalry per Fort and/or, if there is a
Town or Hillfort, up to 2 Militia. Then, in each of up to 2 selected
spaces with Dux Control (Briton Control before Fragmentation)
and either Fort or Cavalry piece, pay 2 Resources to add a number
of Prosperity cubes equal to its current Population (fill lower
row first, 1.7.1).
PLAY NOTE: When no Cavalry is Available, Dux can Train to move
Cavalry from one space to another by removing Cavalry to Available then
placing them (1.4.1).

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

DESIGN NOTE: The Dux ability through Training to restore Prosperity
represents the administrative as well as the engineering capabilities of the
Roman or post-Roman army to help an area recover from the devastation
of war.
3.2.2 March. Marching moves Cavalry and/or allied Troops.
Select any spaces with Cavalry or red Foederati as origins. Form
Marching groups as desired from Troops that begin together in
an origin space. Troops starting together in a space may form
multiple groups. Each group must include at least one Cavalry or
red Foederati cube. Blue Foederati, Comitates, and Militia may be
included if not Fragmentation (6.8) and if the Civitates Faction
agrees to those pieces’ entire route of March. Pay 2 Resources
per origin space from which at least one group will move out. If
this is a Limited Command (2.3.5), select just one origin space
(with multiple groups, if desired).
PROCEDURE: One by one, move each group together into an
Adjacent space then, if desired and if the preceding move followed a Maintained Road (1.3.3) into a space with Dux Control
(Briton Control before Fragmentation, 1.6) at the outset of the
March Command, into a further Adjacent Region, and so on. Any
group departing a Maintained Road or entering a space without
Dux/Briton Control must stop there.
MILITIA: Militia may move no more than one space per March
Command, regardless of Roads.
PICKUP: A moving group may pick up Troops (under the same
conditions as above) when entering a space by paying 2 Resources
(if not paid already for that Region).
PLAY NOTE: Mark each space where Resources are paid with a white
pawn.
DROPOFF: A moving group may drop off Troops in a space;
the rest of the group may move on if at least one Cavalry or red
Foederati remains in the moving group.
3.2.3 Intercept. Intercepting enables Cavalry and red Foederati
to move and immediately fight Raiders, sometimes with the help
of local allies. Select any spaces with both Raiders and Friendly
Control (Briton Control before Fragmentation, Dux Control
at Fragmentation, 1.6) as target spaces, and select spaces with
both Cavalry or red Foederati and such Control as origins. Form
Intercepting groups as desired from Cavalry and red Foederati that
begin together at an origin (a space may have multiple groups).
Pay 2 Resources per origin space from which at least one group
will move out. If this is a Limited Command (2.3.5), select just
one target space (with multiple groups from multiple origins, if
desired).
PROCEDURE: One by one, move each group together either to
an Adjacent space or exclusively along Maintained Roads (1.3.3,
including origin and destination), and in both cases only from,
through, and to spaces that had Friendly Control (1.6) at the outset
of the Intercept Command. After all movement, all Cavalry and
red Foederati in each target space Battle one Barbarian Faction
which has Raiders there (including against that Barbarian’s Warbands). Any Civitates already present fight alongside (3.6) unless
Fragmentation (6.8).

NOTE: Cavalry and red Foederati may Intercept within their own space and
fight at no Resource cost.
3.2.4 Battle. Battle enables the Dux and possibly allied forces to
destroy enemies, to gain Prestige if the Dux win, and to restore
local Prosperity if they destroy enemies carrying Plunder (1.7).
Select any spaces with Cavalry or red Foederati Troops and enemy
pieces. If this is a Limited Command (2.3.5), select just one space.
Pay no Resources.
PROCEDURE: In one space at a time, select one Faction for
Dux to fight using the Battles procedure (3.6).

3.3 Civitates Commands
The Civitates Faction chooses from Muster, March,
Trade, and Battle Commands.
REMINDER: The Civitates may use Wealth to pay for all or part of the
Resource cost of a Command or Feat (1.8.4).
3.3.1 Muster. Mustering places Militia, Comitates, Hillforts, and/
or Towns from Available Forces. Select any spaces that already
have Civitates pieces. Select just one such space if this is a Limited
Command (2.3.5).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, pay 2 Resources to either:
•	 Place 1 Militia per Town or Hillfort, plus—if Briton Control
(meaning Civitates Control under Fragmentation, 1.6)—place
1 Militia per current Population there, plus pay 1 Wealth (in
addition) per Unit to place Comitates instead of a Militia (from
the Civitates Available Forces Box only, 1.4.1); OR
•	 If Friendly pieces outnumber Barbarians (including Raiders),
replace 1 Militia with a Hillfort in a vacant Hillfort or Town
Site, and/or pay 2 Wealth (in addition) to replace 2 Militia or 1
Hillfort and 1 Militia with a Town at a vacant Town Site (which
may have just been vacated by replacing a Hillfort).
PLAY NOTE: Muster cannot place Comitates pieces that are not yet in
play. When Militia or Comitates are on map but not Available, Civitates
can Muster to move such Units from one space to another by removing them
to Available then placing them (1.4.1).
3.3.2 March. Marching moves Civitates and/or allied Troops.
Select any spaces with Comitates, Militia, or blue Foederati as
origins. Form Marching groups as desired from Troops that begin
together in an origin space. Troops starting together in a space
may form multiple groups. Each group must include at least one
Comitates, Militia, or blue Foederati cube. Red Foederati and
Cavalry may be included if not Fragmentation (6.8) and if the
Dux Faction agrees to those pieces’ entire route of March. Pay
2 Resources per origin space from which at least one group will
move out. If this is a Limited Command (2.3.5), select just one
origin space (with multiple groups, if desired).
PROCEDURE: One by one, move each group together into an
Adjacent space then, if desired and if the preceding move followed a Maintained Road (1.3.3) into a space with Briton Control
at the outset of the March Command, into a further Adjacent
Region, and so on. Any group departing a Maintained Road or
entering a space without Briton Control must stop there.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
MILITIA: Militia may move no more than one space per March
Command, regardless of Roads.
PICKUP: A moving group may pick up Troops (under the same
conditions as above) when entering a space by paying 2 Resources
(if not paid already for that Region).
PLAY NOTE: Mark each space where Resources have been paid with
a white pawn.
DROPOFF: A moving group may drop off Troops in a space;
the rest of the group may move on if at least one Comitates or
blue Foederati remains in the moving group.
3.3.3 Trade. Trading allows the Civitates to collect Resources
outside the Epoch Rounds and to recover Prosperity. Select
any spaces with Towns. Select just one space if this a Limited
Command (2.3.5).
PROCEDURE: For each selected space, add +1 Briton Resource
for each Town there. Then, in up to 2 selected spaces with Briton
Control, pay 1 Resource per space to add a number of Prosperity
cubes equal to its current Population (1.7.1).
NOTE: Trade typically earns Resources equal to total Towns on the map, or
1 Resource if a Limited Command.
3.3.4 Battle. Battle enables the Civitates and possibly allied forces
to destroy enemies and to gain Wealth or restore local Prosperity
if they destroy enemies carrying Plunder (1.7). Select any spaces
with Comitates, Militia, or blue Foederati Troops and enemy
pieces. If this is a Limited Command (2.3.5), select just one space.
Battle costs no Resources.

9

•	 PLUNDER: If the target space is a Region (not City), take
and put onto Saxon Units there (1.7.4) a number of Prosperity
cubes from the Region up to the lower of the Region’s current
Population and the number of Saxon Raiders just placed there
(only). NOTE: Raid cannot at this step take more Prosperity than is
left in the target Region. Each Unit can carry at most one Plunder cube
(1.7.4).
•	 BATTLE: Then, if desired, select one Faction (Dux and
Civitates together before Fragmentation) there for the group
of Raiders just placed there (only) to fight using the Battles
procedure (3.6). NOTE: Raids may include Battle by Raiders only,
whereas Barbarian Battle Commands (3.4.4, 3.5.4) must include
Warbands.
•	 If the space had Scotti Control at the outset of the Raid and/
or a Scotti (not Foederati, 1.4.3) Settlement was destroyed, the
Scotti immediately lose Renown equal to the number of Plunder
cubes placed on Saxon Units from Scotti Control and/or Scotti
Settlements.
SAXON RAID EXAMPLE: The Saxons execute a Raid Command
targeting three Regions—Parisi (from Oceanus Germanicus), Corieltauvi
(from the Iceni Region, where they have a Warband and a Settlement), and
Atrebates (from Oceanus Britannicus). The Saxons spend 6 Renown total—2
Renown per target Region.

PROCEDURE: In one space at a time, select one Faction for
Civitates to fight using the Battles procedure (3.6).

3.4 Saxon Commands
The Saxon Faction chooses from Raid, Return,
March, and Battle Commands.
3.4.1 Raid. Raiding places Raider Units and Plunders nonFriendly Regions and Strongholds. Select up to three target
Regions and/or Cities without Saxon Control, or only one if
this is a Limited Command (2.3.5). Pay all Renown costs before
Raiding any space. Each target space must either:
•	 Border Oceanus Britannicus or Oceanus Germanicus Sea OR
•	 Have at least 1 Saxon Warband and 1 Saxon Settlement, or be
Adjacent to a Region with such pieces, or border a Sea itself
bordered by a Region with such pieces.
PLAY NOTE: Use white pawns to mark target Regions.
PROCEDURE: Pay per target space, either 1 Renown point to
roll one four-sided die (1D4) or 2 Renown to roll three (3D4).
NOTE: If free (5.5), pay 0 Renown to roll three dice. Then, for each
such space in turn—
•	 Roll and place that total of Saxon Raiders there.
•	 If the Raid used a Patrolled Sea (1.3.7) to reach that Region
(under the first or second bullet above), reduce that number of
Raiders by the total number of Forts (red Strongholds) located
in Regions bordering that Sea.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

These target Regions respectively hold 4, 1, and 3 Prosperity currently; none
has Saxon Control.
The Saxons decide to begin with their Raid on Parisi. They roll three four-sided
dice for a dismal total of just 4 Raiders! The Dux recently built a Fort at
Derventio, so 4 Forts total are in Regions bordering Oceanus Germanicus,
which is Patrolled. Those Forts drop the rolled total by –4, so all Raiders are
removed before even landing. That Raid is unsuccessful—prevented by the ships
and fortresses of the “Saxon Shore” defensive system, leaving Parisi untouched.
The Saxons then proceed with their Raid on Corieltauvi. They roll three
four-sided dice and roll a total of 8. Since the Raid is originating from a
Region (Iceni) without crossing a Patrolled Sea, there is no reduction. The
Raid thus places 8 Raiders in Corieltauvi. However, despite their number and
Corieltauvi’s Population of 2, the Raiders can Plunder only the lone Prosperity
cube remaining in the Region (leaving it at 0 Prosperity).
Finally, the Saxons tackle the Atrebates Raid. They roll three four-sided dice
for a total of 5. The three Forts bordering the Patrolled Oceanus Britannicus
drops that number by –3, leaving 2 Raiders to land in Atrebates. Those
Raiders each collect 1 Plunder, leaving the Region with 1 Prosperity, preserved
by the Saxon Shore defenses’ winnowing of the Raiders. (The Saxons could
have initiated Battle in each target Region but declined.)
3.4.2 Return. Returning brings Raids to a close by removing
Raiders from the map and converting Plunder into Renown. Select
any number of spaces, or only one if this is a Limited Command
(2.3.5). Each space must have either a Saxon Raider or Warband.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, transfer Plunder to
Renown—remove all Plunder carried by Saxons (to off-board)
and add Saxon Renown equal to the number of Plunder cubes
removed. Then remove all Saxon Raiders from each selected
space (to Available).
PLAY NOTE: Britons usually cannot stop Raids before they inflict
damage, but they can prevent Raiders from Returning home with Plunder
to deny them Renown.
3.4.3 March. Marching moves Saxon Warbands (not Raiders).
Select any number of destination spaces, each adjacent to a Region
with a Saxon Warband or to a Sea, or only one such space if this
is a Limited Command (2.3.5). Pay 1 Renown per destination
space, 2 if moving by sea.
PROCEDURE: For each selected space, move any number
of Saxon Warbands from adjacent spaces into the destination
space. Once per March Command, Saxon Warbands may move
from 1 Coastal Region to another bordering the same Sea; that
destination may not have a Dux Fort. NOTE: Plunder carried by
Warbands moves with them.
3.4.4 Battle. Battle enables the Saxons to gain Plunder and
destroy enemies. Select any spaces with Saxon Warbands (not
just Raiders) and enemy pieces, or only one if this is a Limited
Command (2.3.5). Pay no Renown.
PROCEDURE: In each Battle space at a time, first—if it is a
Region (not City) that has no Saxon Control—take the Region’s
Prosperity cubes up to its current Population as Plunder onto
the Saxon Warbands (up to one per Unit, 1.7.4); then select one
Faction for all (non-Foederati) Saxon Warbands and Raiders there
together to fight using the Battles procedure (3.6).

3.5 Scotti Commands
The Scotti Faction chooses from Raid, Return,
March, and Battle Commands.
3.5.1 Raid. Raiding places Raider Units and Plunders nonFriendly Regions and Strongholds. Select up to four target Regions
and/or Cities without Scotti Control, or only one if this is a
Limited Command (2.3.5). Pay all Renown costs before Raiding
any space. Each target space must either:
•	 Border Oceanus Hibernicus or Oceanus Septentrionalis Sea,
OR
•	 Border Caledonia (Novantae or Votadini, 1.3.9), OR
•	 Have at least 1 Scotti Warband and 1 Scotti Settlement, or be
Adjacent to a Region with such pieces, or border a Sea itself
bordered by a Region with such pieces.
PLAY NOTE: Use white pawns to mark target Regions.
PROCEDURE: Pay per target space, either 0 Renown to roll
one four-sided die (1D4) or 1 Renown point to roll two (2D4).
NOTE: If free (5.5), pay 0 Renown to roll two dice. Then, for each
such space in turn—
•	 Roll and place that total of Scotti Raiders there.
•	 If the Raid used a Patrolled Sea (1.3.7) to reach that Region
(under the first or second bullet above), reduce that number of
Raiders by the total number of Forts (red Strongholds) located
in Regions bordering that Sea.
•	 If the Raid originated from Caledonia, reduce the number
of Raiders by the total number of Forts (red Strongholds) in
Carvetii and Textoverdi.
•	 PLUNDER: If the target space is a Region (not City), take
and put onto Scotti Units there (1.7.4) a number of Prosperity
cubes from the Region up to the lower of the Region’s current
Population and the number of Scotti Raiders just placed there
(only). NOTE: Raid cannot at this step take more Prosperity than is
left in the target Region. Each Unit can carry at most one Plunder cube
(1.7.4).
•	 BATTLE: Then, if desired, select one Faction (Dux and
Civitates together before Fragmentation) there for the group
of Raiders just placed there (only) to fight using the Battles
procedure (3.6).
•	 If the space had Saxon Control at the outset of the Raid and/
or a Saxon (not Foederati, 1.4.3) Settlement was destroyed,
the Saxons immediately lose Renown equal to the number of
Plunder cubes placed on Scotti Units from Saxon Control and/
or Saxon Settlements.
3.5.2 Return. Returning brings Raids to a close by removing
Raiders from the map and converting Plunder into Renown. Select
any number of spaces, or only one if this is a Limited Command
(2.3.5). Each space must have either a Scotti Raider or Warband.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, transfer Plunder to
Renown—remove all Plunder carried by Scotti (to off-board)
and add Scotti Renown equal to the number of Plunder cubes
removed. Then remove all Scotti Raiders from each selected
space (to Available).

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
3.5.3 March. Marching moves Scotti Warbands (not Raiders).
Select any number of destination spaces, each adjacent to a Region
with a Scotti Warband or to a Sea, or only one such space if this
is a Limited Command (2.3.5). Pay 1 Renown per destination
space, 2 if moving by sea.
PROCEDURE: For each selected space, move any number of
Scotti Warbands from adjacent spaces into the destination space.
Once per March Command, Scotti Warbands may move from 1
Coastal Region to another bordering the same Sea; that destination
may not have a Dux Fort.
NOTE: Plunder carried by Warbands moves with them.
3.5.4 Battle. Battle enables the Scotti to gain Plunder and destroy
enemies. Select any spaces with Scotti Warbands (not just Raiders)
and enemy pieces, or only one if this is a Limited Command
(2.3.5). Pay no Renown.
PROCEDURE: In each Battle space at a time, first—if it is a
Region (not City) that has no Scotti Control—take the Region’s
Prosperity cubes up to its current Population as Plunder onto
the Scotti Warbands (up to one per Unit, 1.7.4); then select one
Faction for all (non-Foederati) Scotti Warbands and Raiders there
to fight together using the Battles procedure (3.6).

3.6 Battles
Whenever two Factions do Battle, whether from a Battle Command (3.2.4, 3.3.4, 3.4.4, 3.5.4), Dux Intercept (3.2.3), Barbarian
Raid (3.4.1, 3.5.1), enemy response to Barbarian Deep Raid via
Surprise Feat (4.4.2, 4.5.2) or to Saxon Ravage (4.4.3), or an
Event, they use the Battles procedure below and as listed on the
Battles aid sheet.
3.6.1 General. The following applies during all Battles.
BRITON COOPERATION: Unless at Fragmentation (6.8.1)
or a Battle between the Dux and Civitates, Dux pieces (Cavalry,
Forts, and red Foederati) and Civitates pieces (Comitates, Militia,
Towns, Hillforts, and blue Foederati) within a Battle space fight as
a single attacking or defending side. Under Fragmentation, Dux
and Civitates pieces fight as separate Factions.
NOTE: Dux and Civitates may Battle one another regardless of Imperium
(6.8).
BATTLE STEPS: Within a Battle, first Field Battle and then
Assault (as applicable) proceed through a sequence of steps that
determine the order in which various Units will inflict and absorb
losses. A given Unit may Strike (inflict losses upon the enemy)
once per Field Battle (3.6.3); defenders do so twice per Assault,
Attackers once (3.6.4). A Unit’s type (1.4), the terrain (1.3.1),
Feats (4.0), Capabilities (5.3), and other Events (5.0) together
as applicable determine the step in which a Unit will Strike. All
Strikes and losses within a given step are simultaneous. A Unit
cannot Strike if it was removed in an earlier step.
STRIKES AND LOSSES: See the tables below. Each Striking
Unit inflicts and absorbs 1 loss, except—
•	 In Field Battle, Militia and Raiders are halved (inflicting and
absorbing only ½ loss each, 3.6.3).

11

•	 In the Escalade step of Assault (3.6.4), defending Units inflict
losses per the type of Stronghold, attacking Raiders absorb only
half losses (½ each), and one attacking Cavalry may absorb
double loss (2 losses).
A Unit must be allocated its full loss in order to be removed
(Cavalry to Casualties, 1.4.1). Within a Battle step, all losses that
can be absorbed to remove a Unit must be (EXCEPTION: Cavalry
in Assault, 3.6.4). It is therefore possible that the final ½ loss
suffered in a Battle is in effect ignored. Within these restrictions,
each Battling Faction selects its own Units to absorb losses.
•	 If Civitates and Dux are fighting together and cannot agree
on allocation of losses, each must absorb as close to half the
total losses possible within each step, without more than a
single Unit total absorbing a loss without removal, and with
the Dux absorbing any odd losses. EXAMPLE: A Briton force
of 1 Cavalry, 1 Comitates, and 1 Militia during a Field Battle against
Raiders suffers 1½ losses; if the Briton Factions fail to agree on how to
absorb them, remove the Cavalry (1 loss) and the Militia (½ loss).

TERRAIN: As noted in sections below (3.6.2, 3.6.3), certain Units
may enjoy advantages when fighting in Home Terrain or other
Rough terrain (1.3.1).
•	 Fens is Home Terrain for all black Units—Saxon Raiders, Saxon
Warbands, and red or blue Saxon Foederati.
•	 Hills is Home Terrain for all green Units—Scotti Raiders, Scotti
Warbands, and red or blue Scotti Foederati.
•	 Hills is Home Terrain for Comitates and Militia if the Civitates
have played their Cymbrogi Pivotal Event (providing them that
Capability, 5.3, 5.7).
•	 Fens and Hills are Rough terrain (helping Raiders Evade there
(1.4) even if not Home Terrain, 3.6.2); Clear and City are not
Rough.
3.6.2 Pre-Battle. Before a possible Field Battle (3.6.3), certain
Units may try to Evade or Ambush to Strike earlier. Attacking
then defending Factions designate their own Units in the space
as desired and roll a six-sided die (D6) for Raiders then Troops.
•	Raiders: Raiders may roll either to Evade or Ambush (not
both). Designate before rolling which attempt, if any, all Raiders
in that space will make. Raiders successfully Evade on a roll of
4-6 on a six-sided die if in Home Terrain, 5-6 in other Rough
terrain, and 6 in Clear terrain. Raiders in Home Terrain Ambush
on a 5-6 roll on a six-sided die.

© 2017GMT Games, LLC

12

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

•	Troops: All Warbands, Foederati Troops, Comitates, and/
or Militia (not Cavalry or Raiders) in Home Terrain similarly
may roll either to Evade or Ambush. Such Troops in Home
Terrain successfully Evade on a roll of 5-6 on a six-sided die
or Ambush on a 3-6.
EVASION: Groups that Evade successfully do not take part
in any ensuing Field Battle or Assault (they neither Strike nor
absorb losses). If all Units of a side in the Battle space Evade
successfully, there is no Field Battle. (Non-Evading attackers may
Assault enemy Strongholds.)
AMBUSH: Troops that successfully Ambush will Strike in the
Charge/Ambush step of the Field Battle (only, along with
Cavalry).
NOTE: Ambush—whether via this pre-Battle step, a Feat (4.0), or an
Event (5.1.1)—will only apply to Units that are in their Home Terrain.
EXAMPLE: Dux Retaliation (4.2.4) in Clear terrain does not enable
Saxon Units to Ambush.
3.6.3 Field Battle. After resolving Pre-Battle per above, carry out
the following steps in order. Each type of Unit Strikes during its
allocated step if and only if it has not Evaded successfully (3.6.2),
has not Withdrawn in the Withdrawal step, has survived earlier
steps, and has not already Struck in an earlier step.
•	 Trap (step 0): All Units benefitting from an Event enabling
them to “Trap” (if any) Strike simultaneously, then Factions
apply losses to their own Units (3.6.1).
•	Withdrawal: Surviving defending Units may Withdraw within
Friendly Strongholds in the Battle space (place Withdrawn Units
on the Stronghold piece) up to Holding Capacities shown in the
Strongholds and Assaults table below (and with any Plunder
they carry). Before Fragmentation (6.8), Dux and Civitates
may admit the other’s Units into its Strongholds. Withdrawn
Units neither Strike nor absorb losses in the Field Battle; if all
non-Evading defenders Withdraw, immediately end the Field
Battle and proceed to Assault.
•	 Charge/Ambush (step 1): All surviving Cavalry and
Ambushing Units Strike; apply losses (3.6.1).
•	 Melee (step 2): All surviving Warbands, Foederati Troops,
Comitates, and Militia Strike; apply losses.
•	 Harass (step 3): All surviving Raiders Strike; apply losses.
3.6.4 Assaults. If all defending Units have successfully Evaded,
have Withdrawn, or have been removed, surviving non-Evading
attackers may Assault the defending Faction or Factions’ Strongholds. If the space has two defending Strongholds, the attacker
chooses which to Assault first (if any) and—if that Assault
removes the first Stronghold—whether to Assault the second.

ASSAULT STEPS: After resolving any Field Battle (3.6.3) and if
the defending Faction(s) have any Strongholds in the space, the
attacker may carry out the following steps in order.
•	 Coup de Main: If the Assault is part of a Raid or Battle
Command (3.4.1/.4; 3.5.1/.4) paired with the Surprise Feat
(4.4.2, 4.5.2), roll a six-sided die (D6). Coup de Main succeeds
on a roll no more than +1 above the difference between the
target Stronghold’s Holding Capacity and the number of Units
Withdrawn inside it. EXAMPLE: A Town (Capacity of 4) has 2
Militia pieces inside; a roll of 3 or less [(4 – 2) + 1] succeeds. Eboracum
and Londinium Capacity counts as 4 for this roll. If Coup de
Main succeeds, skip the Escalade step below and immediately
Storm the Stronghold.
•	 Escalade (step 1): All Units Withdrawn inside that Stronghold
plus the Stronghold’s intrinsic Garrison Units Strike. Each
such Unit inflicts losses equal to the Stronghold’s Escalade
Defense value on the Assaulting Units (3.6.1 and tables above).
Assaulting Raiders are halved during this step (for absorbing
losses, usually, only ½ loss per Raider piece). If Assaulting
Units include Cavalry, Dux may elect to have one Cavalry cube
absorb double losses (usually, 2 losses, perhaps preventing any
removal); if Dux does so, the first attacking Unit to absorb
losses must be that Cavalry.
DESIGN NOTE: Despite the label “Cavalry”, not all Dux units were
mounted.
•	 Storm (step 2): All surviving Units on both sides Strike
(including the Stronghold Garrison). Each inflicts 1 loss (no
halving or Defense Factor). The Stronghold’s intrinsic Garrison
absorbs losses first, then pieces Withdrawn inside do so. NOTE:
Defenders Strike in both Assault steps.

INTRINSIC GARRISON: During Assault, Strongholds have
intrinsic Garrison Units per the table above that Strike and must
be removed via losses for the Stronghold to fall. The Garrison
will absorb losses before any defending pieces Withdrawn into
the Stronghold have to.
DESIGN NOTE: Garrisons in part represent Stronghold walls.

STRONGHOLD DESTRUCTION: If the intrinsic Garrison
and any Withdrawn Units absorb enough losses to remove them
entirely and Assaulting Units remain, remove that Stronghold. If
the defender has another Stronghold in the space, the attacker
may now Assault that Stronghold also.

a) Pre-Battle—The Saxons are on Home Terrain in the Fens of Corieltauvi. They form a group from all the Raiders and another from the Warband.
Each will roll for Ambush. The Raiders need a 5 or 6 but roll a “3”. The
Warband also rolls a “3”, but that is good enough to enable it to Strike at
the same time as the Cavalry.

3.6.5 Battle Consequences. Carry out the following, according
to which pieces the Battle in that space has removed so far.
•	 If any Cavalry pieces (not a Fort’s intrinsic Garrison) fought
and its side removed more enemy pieces (including Strongholds)
than it lost, the Dux gains +1 Prestige (regardless of what
pieces survived). EXCEPTION: Do not add Prestige if Dux and
Civitates are Battling one another before Fragmentation (6.8). If an
enemy fighting against Cavalry removed more pieces than it
lost, lower Prestige by –1.
•	 If Assault removes a Fort (red Stronghold) or—before
Fragmentation—a Town, lower Prestige by –2 for each such
Stronghold destroyed.
•	 If an Assault removes a Stronghold, the executing Faction
places 2 Plunder from off board onto any attacking Units (up
to holding capacity, 1.7.4). If that Stronghold was a Town, it
instead places 3 Plunder. If that Stronghold was in a City, also
take all the City’s Prosperity as Plunder.
•	 If Dux Assault removes a Stronghold, add +1 Prestige,
unless against Civitates before Fragmentation (6.8).
•	 If a Barbarian Faction removed more enemy pieces
(including Strongholds) than it lost and has pieces remaining
in the space—excluding Evaders (3.6.2)—it gains +1 Renown.
•	 If the executing Faction removed any enemy pieces
carrying Plunder (1.7.4), that Faction may either distribute
half (round down) of the removed Plunder among attacking
Units (other than Cavalry); or, if Briton, return the first
removed Plunder to the Battle space as Prosperity (1.7.1-.3); or,
if Barbarian in a space that it Controls (1.6), gain +1 Renown
for each removed Plunder. Set other removed Plunder aside,
off board.

b) Field Battle—There is no Trap step (a rare Event case, 5.0). The
Civitates decide to Withdraw their lone (and expensively bought) Comitates
into their Town’s safety. The Dux decides to fight in the field with their three
Cavalry present, in hopes of gaining Prestige, wear down the Raiders, and
destroy the Warband. Three Cavalry Charge to inflict three losses at the same
time that the Warband Ambushes to inflict one. Dux removes one Cavalry.
Saxons could remove six Raiders (½ each) to save the Warband, but then
too few Raiders (only three) would survive to kill off the Cavalry force; so the
Saxons remove the Warband and four Raiders, leaving five Raiders with two
Plunder. These Raiders then Harass to destroy the remaining two Cavalry.

3.6.6 Siege. After any Battle Consequences, the attacker may
besiege one or both defending Strongholds in the Battle space
to wear down Withdrawn defenders if meeting the following
requirements.
•	 All defending Units in the space must have Evaded, Withdrawn,
or been removed in Field Battle.
•	 Besieged Strongholds may not have been Assaulted.
•	 The besieger must have a number Troops (not Raiders) in the
space at least equal to the Holding Capacity of that Stronghold.
Count each attacking Troop for only one Siege that Battle.

c) Assault—The Saxons have cleared the Region from Briton Troops in the
field and have five Raiders left after the Field Battle to Assault. They will seek
to use their Surprise Feat (4.4.2) to find a weakly defended part of the walls
and take the Town of Ratae by Coup de Main. The Town’s Capacity of 4,
plus 1, minus the 1 Unit Withdrawn to defend it, mean that the Saxons need
a roll of 1-4 for a Coup de Main. The roll is a “6”, the Assault proceeds
by the usual sequence instead. In the Escalade step, the Town’s defenders of
one Comitates and two intrinsic Garrison Units each inflict ½ losses per the
Town’s Defense Factor, for a total loss of 1½ on the assailants to remove three
Raiders. In the Storm step, the defenders inflict enough losses to remove the
remaining Raiders, while the intrinsic Garrison absorbs the 2 losses from the
Raiders. The Assault is over, and the Town does not fall.

STARVATION: The defender immediately removes one Unit
piece from within that Stronghold (if any, Cavalry to Casualties;
no impact on Prestige, 3.6.5).
BATTLE EXAMPLE: Nine Saxon Raiders have landed in Corieltauvi
and taken two Plunder, reinforcing a lone Saxon Warband that Settled there
previously. As part of a Battle Command (3.4.4) with a Surprise Feat (4.4.2),
the Saxons decide to fight the Britons. The Imperium is not yet Fragmented
(6.8), so the Dux and Civitates in the Region must both defend together.

d) Battle Consequences—The three Cavalry were wiped out, but the
Saxons lost more pieces, so the Dux receives +1 Prestige in recognition of
their brave stand. The two Plunder cubes that the eliminated Saxons had
been carrying are set aside (since the Britons were not the executing Faction).
e) Siege—No Siege is possible, for a variety of reasons: the Town already was
Assaulted; the Fort at Lindum has no Units in it for a Siege to remove; and
too few Saxon Troops survive in any case (zero) to equal the Fort’s Capacity
of 2. The Battle is over.

4.0 Feats
4.1 Feats in General
When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes a Command in at least one space (3.0), it may also execute
one type of its Feats (EXCEPTION: Limited Commands, 2.3.5).
Some Feats have added Resource or Renown costs. As with
Commands, the executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or
pieces affected and the order of actions as allowed within the
rules and predesignates those spaces (marking them with gray
pawns, 3.1.1, even if requirements will only be met later during
that accompanying Command). Select a given space only once
for a given Feat. Events may grant free Feats (costing neither
Resources nor Renown nor further affecting Eligibility, 3.1.2, 5.5).
Important—With the exception of Feats that modify Commands among several spaces (Surprise, Ravage, Shield Wall,
and Ransom; 4.4.2-.4, 4.5.2-.3), a Faction may execute its Feat
at any one time immediately before, during, or immediately
after its Command.
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Feat, the 2nd Eligible
Faction will have the option to execute the card’s Event, and vice versa (2.3.4).
4.1.1 Accompanying Commands. Some Feats are limited to
accompanying certain types of Commands (3.0), and/or only
where those Commands occur, and/or by Fragmentation (6.8).
Unless otherwise specified by Event (5.1), a Feat must accompany
some Command.

4.2 Dux Feats
The Dux Faction may choose from Build, Invite,
Requisition, and Retaliate Feats.
4.2.1 Build. Building places Forts or Towns by rebuilding Roman
fortifications with the engineering expertise of the Roman or
post-Roman army and can add Prestige. It may only accompany
a Train or March Command (3.2.1-.2) and occur in spaces that
have Cavalry, more Friendly than enemy pieces (including Raiders),
and a valid Stronghold Site (1.3.5).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, pay 3 Resources to
either—
•	 Place a Fort from Available into a vacant Town or Hillfort Site;
OR
•	 Remove two Militia cubes or one Militia and a Hillfort from
the space to place a Town in a vacant Town Site (only, 1.3.5,
may have been just vacated by replacing a Hillfort) and add +2
Prestige.

4.2.2 Invite. Invitation enables the Dux Faction to settle Barbarian Foederati mercenaries under its command on available land,
or to bribe Foederati away from the Civitates. It may accompany
Train, March, or Intercept Commands (3.2.1-.3), not Battle. It
may occur in just one Region (not City) that must have both a
Dux piece (Cavalry, red Foederati, or Fort) and Briton Control.
It is not allowed under Fragmentation (6.8).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either—
In a Region, place one Settlement of a Barbarian
•	
Faction (from Available, 1.4.1)—either in a vacant
Town or Hillfort Site (1.3.5) or by replacing a (red)
Fort—in order to place up to three (if Saxon) or two (if Scotti)
Warbands of that Barbarian Faction, all under red Foederati
markers (1.4.3); OR
•	 In a Region or City, pay 1 Resource per piece to convert all blue
Foederati Warbands and Settlements of one Barbarian Nation
to red Foederati (flip their blue Foederati markers to red).
NOTE: In order to place new Foederati Warbands, Invite must place a new
Foederati Settlement.
4.2.3 Requisition. Requisition enables the Dux Faction to secure
funds for its sole military use from Briton Resources (even at
Fragmentation, 6.8). It may only accompany Train, March, or
Battle Commands (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.4), not Intercept (3.2.3). It
may occur in any spaces with at least 1 Dux piece (Cavalry, Fort,
or red Foederati).
PROCEDURE: For each of up to six selected spaces that have
a Civitates Stronghold (Town, Hillfort, or blue Foederati Settlement), transfer 1 Resource from (blue) Briton Resources to (red)
Dux Resources. Once Briton Resources reach zero, instead transfer from Civitates Wealth (1-for-1, to a minimum of zero). Then
convert all Dux Plunder anywhere to Dux Resources, 1-for-1.
4.2.4 Retaliate. Retaliation enables the Dux to strike directly at
enemy Renown or Wealth while gaining Plunder and Prestige. It
may only accompany Intercept (3.2.3) or Battle (3.2.4) Commands
and occur in just one space that must have an enemy Stronghold.
It may target the Civitates only under Fragmentation (6.8).
PROCEDURE: In one Battle space (3.6) —
•	 Cavalry may receive and carry any Plunder from destroyed
Strongholds (1.7.4, 3.6.5).
•	 If the Battle removes all Strongholds of that enemy in the space,
add +3 Dux Prestige total, and reduce that enemy’s Renown
or Wealth by –5 total.

4.3 Civitates Feats

4.4 Saxon Feats

The Civitates Faction may choose from Rule, Invite,
Reinforce, and Pillage Feats.

The Saxon Faction may choose from Settle, Surprise,
Ravage, and Shield Wall Feats.

4.3.1 Rule. Ruling enables the Civitates to amass Wealth, reduce
Dux Prestige, or increase Population under Briton Control. It
may accompany Muster (3.3.1), March (3.3.2), or Trade (3.3.3)
Commands (not Battle), and occur in up to three spaces with
Briton Control (not Dux Control under Fragmentation, 6.8).

4.4.1 Settle. Settling enables the Saxons to convert transient
Raiders and locals into Warbands, plant Settlements, and grow
their Population in Britain. It may only accompany Return (3.4.2)
or March (3.4.3) Commands and occur in a single space where
Saxon pieces—including Raiders—outnumber those of all other
Factions’ combined (including enemy Raiders).

PROCEDURE: In each selected space, transfer all Plunder carried
by Civitates Units to Wealth, 1 for 1 (remove Plunder cubes and
add Wealth), then, either—
•	 Pay 2 Briton Resources to add +1 Wealth; OR
•	 If no Dux piece, pay 1 Wealth to reduce Dux Prestige by –1;
OR
•	
If a Region (not City) with a Civitates Stronghold,
pay 5 Resources and discard an available Refugees
marker to add +1 Population (to a maximum of 1
above printed Population, 1.3.6).
NOTE: It is possible to mix and match all three options in different spaces
within the same Rule Feat.
DESIGN NOTE: Ruling represents efforts by the civilian authorities to
secure their treasure and luxury, promote their authority by resettling refugees,
and challenge the legitimacy of the imperial or post-imperial authority by a
display of wealth and power.
4.3.2 Invite. Civitates Invite as Dux does (4.2.2) but
replace Hillforts instead of Forts and to Civitates
command using blue Foederati markers or flipping red
to blue (1.4.3).
4.3.3 Reinforce. Reinforcing enables the Civitates to add Friendly
Troops to battles from neighboring spaces or by local emergency
muster. It may accompany a Battle Command (3.3.4) only and
may occur in both any Battle spaces and spaces with (blue) Briton
Control that are adjacent to a Battle space. Pay 2 Resources per
space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either—
•	 Roll a six-sided die and move that number less 2 (1D6–2) of
Briton Troops (Comitates, Militia, and blue Foederati Warbands;
plus Cavalry and red Foederati only if the Dux agrees) total
into any adjacent Battle spaces; OR
•	 If the space is a Battle space, Muster Militia (only) there as per
3.3.1 (at no added cost).

PROCEDURE: First, if that space has or is adjacent to any Raiders Returning as part of that accompanying Command (3.4.2, 4.1),
roll a six-sided die (D6) for each such Raider and place a Warband
in the Settle space for each roll of 4-6. Then, if desired, either:
•	 If the Settle space already has a Saxon Settlement, pay 3 Renown
to place 1 Warband per Saxon Settlement there plus—if under
Saxon Control at the outset of this Settle Feat—1 Warband per
the space’s Population; OR
•	 Remove 3 Warbands (to Available) to add +1 Population (up to
printed Population +1, 1.3.6) and/or, if the space has an empty
Site, remove 2 Saxon Warbands to place 1 Saxon Settlement
there.
PLAY NOTE: Raid (3.4.1, 3.5.1) followed by Return (3.4.2, 3.5.2)
plus Settle is the main path for placing Barbarian forces onto the map.
4.4.2 Surprise. Surprise may enable the Saxons to catch enemy
Strongholds unawares and to Raid deep into less well-protected
or still prosperous enemy territory. It may only accompany Raid
(3.4.1) or Battle (3.4.4) Commands and occur in only one Raid
or Battle space.
PROCEDURE: Assaults in the Surprise space roll for Coup de
Main (3.6.4). If the Surprise accompanies a Raid Command, the
Surprise Raid Region may be a Deep Raid:
•	 A Deep Raid may select a target Region adjacent to a valid Raid
target Region (3.4.1).
•	 The Deep Raid target counts as one of the three allowed
Regions for the Raid Command and is subject to any Patrolled
Sea or Event effects that would apply to that adjacent Region
(through which the Deep Raid passes).
•	 In the Deep Raid Region, either the Dux or a Faction with
Control (1.6)—the Dux has the first option—may free Battle
(3.6) the Saxons before the Raiders Plunder the Region. If the
Faction with Control Battled, the Saxons may not Battle.

4.3.4 Pillage. Pillaging enables the Civitates to Plunder enemy
territory and damage enemy Renown or Prestige. It may accompany a March or Battle Command (3.3.2, 3.3.4) and occur in any
Regions without Briton Control (1.6).
PROCEDURE: In each selected Region, collect Prosperity up
to the Region’s Population as Plunder on Civitates Troops (each
Unit may take and carry only 1 Plunder cube, 1.7.4); then, if there
is an enemy Stronghold in the Region, reduce that one enemy’s
Renown or Prestige by the amount Plundered.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

4.5 Scotti Feats
The Scotti Faction may choose from Settle, Surprise,
Ransom, and Entreat Feats.
4.5.1 Settle. Scotti Settle works like Saxon Settle (4.4.1) using
Scotti pieces and Scotti Control, except that rolls of 5 or 6 (instead
of 4-6) are required to replace Raiders with Warbands and the
Scotti may not remove Warbands to place Population.
4.5.2 Surprise. Scotti Surprise works like Saxon Surprise (4.4.2).
A Scotti Deep Raid target counts as one of the four allowed
Regions of the Scotti Raid Command (3.5.1).
4.5.3 Ransom. Ransoming can enable the Scotti to attempt to
gain Renown from payments for high-ranking captives. It may
accompany Raid (3.5.1) or Battle (3.5.4) Commands and may
occur in any Raid and Battle Regions. If with Raid, some Scotti
Raiders must succeed in landing in the Region for Ransom to
occur there.

SURPRISE WITH DEEP RAID EXAMPLE: The Saxons decide to
accompany a Raid Command with a Surprise Feat. They select the Catuvellauni
Region for a Deep Raid—Catuvellauni is adjacent to the Iceni Region, which
(among other adjacent Regions) is a valid target for a normal Saxon Raid via
Oceanus Germanicus (3.4.1). The Saxons select two additional Regions as
regular Raid targets, Iceni and Trinovantes, and pay 2 Renown for each of the
three targets. Patrols from Forts bordering Oceanus Germanicus will reduce the
number of Raiders reaching Catuvellauni, as for the other targets. Before the
Raiders Plunder Catuvellauni, an enemy there may Battle them. Any Assaults
in Catuvellauni during the Raid would attempt Coups de Main (3.6.4).
4.4.3 Ravage. Ravaging enables the Saxons to gather Plunder
quickly and terrorizes the local Briton population into flight. It
may only accompany Raid (3.4.1) or Battle (3.4.4) Commands. It
affects all Raid and Battle Regions that the Saxons desire, except
a Raid target where no new Raiders arrived.
PROCEDURE: In those Raid and Battle Regions, Plunder is not
limited by the Region’s Population (only by carrying capacity,
1.7.4), but no Saxon Assault is allowed. In each Region, after
Plunder (if any, 3.4.1, 3.4.4), roll a six-sided die (D6)—on a 4-6,
reduce the Region’s Population by –1 (to a minimum of 0, 1.3.6).
Then (regardless of the roll), in each Ravaged Raid Region where
the Saxons do not Battle, the Dux, then Civitates, then Scotti may
free Battle against the Saxons there (3.6, in rare cases, several
Battles, but no non-Saxon Unit may Battle more than once, and so
Britons fighting together may Battle only once). In those Battles,
Saxons may not Evade or Withdraw.

PROCEDURE: In each Region, after Plunder (if any, 3.5.1, 3.5.4),
roll a six-sided die (D6)—on a 4-6, transfer 1 Resource or Renown
from a Faction that has a Stronghold there to Scotti Renown.
NOTE 1: Successful Ransom against a Civitates Stronghold when Briton
Resources are at 0 compels the Civitates instead to transfer Wealth to Scotti
Renown (1.8.4).
NOTE 2: Successful Ransom against a Dux Stronghold compels the Dux to
transfer a Dux (red) Resource to Scotti Renown, even if Army Preemption
is in effect. If Dux Resources are at 0 and Army Preemption is in effect, a
Briton (blue) Resource (but no Wealth) is transferred instead.
NOTE 3: Only 1 Stronghold can be targeted by Ransom per Region and
per Feat.
4.5.4 Entreat. Entreating enables the Scotti to convert Civitates
pieces to Scotti pieces. It may accompany Return (3.5.2) or Battle
(3.5.4) Commands and may occur in a single Hills Region (not
Fens, Clear, or City, 1.3.1-.2) that has at least one Scotti Warband
in it. The Entreat Region need not have been selected for Return
or Battle.
PROCEDURE: Pay 4 Renown to replace up to one Hillfort in
that Hills Region with a Scotti Settlement and up to two Militia
with Scotti Warbands.

NOTE: For each Ravage roll that effectively reduces a Region’s Population,
add one Refugees marker in the Civitates Available Forces box (1.3.6)
4.4.4 Shield Wall. Forming Shield Wall improves Saxon discipline
in Battle. It may only accompany a Battle (3.4.4) Command and
affects all Battle spaces.
PROCEDURE: During Field Battle (3.6.3, not Assault, 3.6.4),
double losses (usually, two instead of one) are needed to remove
Saxon Warbands.

Faction.

(5.2)

5.1 Executing Events
When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally and in the order given (sometimes involving actions or
decisions by other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the
executing Faction makes all selections allowed for in implementing
the text, such as which pieces are affected. Some Events have
costs.
EXAMPLE: Saxons playing an Event to place Foederati would get to choose
either red or blue Foederati markers.
NOTE: Instructions to place pieces, unless otherwise specified, mean the
placing Faction’s pieces.
5.1.1 Events versus Rules. When executing Event text, follow
normal rules, such as restrictions and procedures for free actions
granted (5.5), unless otherwise specified. Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence, except that:
•	 Events do not place pieces that are not Available (1.4.1) unless
specified (such as from Casualties or Out of Play); they remove
rather than replace if the replacement is not Available. NOTE:
The executing Faction can remove its own pieces to make them Available
(1.4.1).
•	 Events may not violate stacking (1.4.2). Unless otherwise
specified, a Faction placing a Stronghold via Event (5.0) must
place it in a legal vacant Site, if possible; if no legal Site is vacant,
the Faction may select and replace an existing Stronghold in
such a Site.
•	 Events do not raise Resources, Renown, Prestige, or Wealth
above 80; any excess is lost (1.8).

DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of the same
cause, alternative interpretations, or forks in the historical road.

5.3 Capabilities
A yellow triskele marks an Event as a
“Capability”, meaning it has lasting effects
that either help or hurt one or more Factions. When executing such text, put the card near
the affected player(s) and place a triskele/sail marker on its
appropriate side (Unshaded or Shaded) onto the card. The Event’s
effects last for the rest of the game (unless altered by a later Event,
5.1.2).

5.4 Momentum
An orange sail marks an Event as a
“Momentum”, meaning it has lapsing
effects that help or hurt one or more Factions. When executing such text, put the card near
the draw deck and place a triskele/sail marker on its appropriate
side (Unshaded or Shaded) onto the card. The Event’s effects last
until the end of the next Epoch Round (6.7, unless altered by a
later Event, 5.1.2).

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

5.5 Free Actions
Many Events allow the Executing or other Factions immediate
Commands or Feats that interrupt the usual sequence and are free:
they may be executed to their full extent at no cost in Resources or
Renown and do not further affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1). Other
aspects such as location requirements remain, unless modified
by Event text (5.1.1). Free Feats that modify Accompanying
Commands—such as Surprise (4.4.2, 4.5.2), Ravage (4.4.3),
Shield Wall (4.4.4), and Ransom (4.5.3)—may only be executed
if that Accompanying Command (4.1.1) is also occurring as part
of the Event.

5.6 Epoch Events
Epoch cards—labeled as either Early or Late—bear Events
(2.4.1) that are executed during the Epoch Event phase of the
Epoch Round (6.4) instead of during the Event card Sequence
of Play (2.3). Epoch Events may show Faction symbols that refer
to which Factions have the main decisions to make in executing
the Event. Epoch Events are and function otherwise as Events.
NOTE: While Epoch Events have optional aspects within them, the overall
Events must be executed.

5.7 Pivotal Events
Pivotal Event cards are given to certain Factions at Setup (2.1)
and interact with the Sequence of Play in a different way (2.3.8).
They may feature a pre-condition in red text that must be met in
order to play the card. Pivotal Events are and function otherwise
as Events, including possible Capability effects that linger (5.3).

6.0 Epoch Rounds
Conduct an Epoch Round in the sequence of phases below (6.16.7) as each Epoch Card is played. The Epoch Round sheet and
game board also list this sequence.

NOTE 2: In simple situations, such as when no Foederati Warband is
carrying Plunder and/or all Foederati are being paid, you may dispense with
placing Plunder on the Warbands and transfer directly the amounts paid to
the respective Nations’ Renown.

6.2 Imperium Phase
6.2.1 Hoarding. Civitates may transfer Briton Resources up to
half the number (rounded up) of Towns on the map (Hillforts
instead if the Cymbrogi Event is in effect, 5.7) to Wealth (one
for one).
6.2.2 Imperium Track. Check and adjust the
Imperium marker on the Imperium Track (6.8) in
sequence as follows.
•	 If at Roman Rule and Briton Control is 30 or less and/or Total
Prosperity + Prestige is 55 or less, shift down to Autonomy
(without changing Dominance).
•	 If Briton Control is 20 or less and/or Total Prosperity +
Prestige is 30 or less, set status to Fragmentation.
•	 If the above caused any shift down from Roman Rule or
Autonomy, divide Prestige and Wealth by 2 (round up).
•	 If at Military Dominance and Wealth exceeds Prestige by at
least 10, shift to Civilian Dominance.
•	 If at Civilian Dominance and Wealth does not exceed Prestige
by at least 6, shift to Military Dominance.

6.3 Victory Phase
If any Faction has met its victory condition (7.2), the game ends
now; see Victory (7.1) to determine winner and rank order. If
not but if this is the final Epoch Round, conduct an immediate
Recovery Phase (6.8) and then determine Victory (7.3). If neither,
continue with an Epoch Event phase per below.

NOTE: The preceding card will have been switched to the top of the draw
deck upon revealing the Epoch card (2.3.7).

EXCEPTIONS: If a player is running two Factions, both must meet their
conditions to end the game (1.5.1). If the “Barbarian Conspiracy” scenario
or if at Fragmentation (6.8) in any scenario, skip the above final Recovery.

6.1 Annona Phase

6.4 Epoch Event Phase

For each Foederati Warband on the map (red or blue), the Dux
may pay 1 Resource to place 1 Plunder (from off-map) on it. Then
the Civitates may do the same thing. Once both Factions are done
with the payments they want or can execute, in every Region with
a Foederati Warband of any given Nation and color left without
carrying Plunder, remove all Foederati markers of that color from
that Nation’s pieces (adjust Control). Then transfer all Plunder
carried by Foederati Warbands (not newly released Warbands) to
the Renown of that Foederati’s Barbarian Nation. A Foederati Settlement with no corresponding Foederati Warbands at the outset
of Annona remains Foederati. Released Warbands (Scotti then
Saxons) then Plunder their Region’s Prosperity up to Population.

Resolve the current Epoch card’s Event (5.6).

NOTE 1: Annona must be paid either for all Foederati of a given color
(red/blue) and Nation (Saxon/Scotti) within a given space, or for none there
of that color and Nation.

6.5.2 Civitates Revenue. Add (blue) Briton Resources equal to
Prosperity under (blue) Briton Control plus the total number of
Towns or—instead, after Cymbrogi (5.7)—Hillforts on the map.

NOTE: Epoch Events often shift Imperium status (6.8).

6.5 Revenue Phase
Add or subtract Prestige, Resources, and Renown as follows (to
a maximum of 80 and minimum of 0 each, 1.8).
6.5.1 Dux Revenue. At Military Dominance (6.8), increase Prestige
by +5 if under Roman Rule or +2 if under Autonomy. Under
Fragmentation, add (red) Dux Resources equal to Prosperity (not
Plunder, 1.7) under Dux Control (1.6) plus Towns under Dux
Control plus the total number of (red) Forts on map.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
6.5.3 Imperial Taxation. Then, under Roman Rule only (not
Autonomy or Fragmentation, 6.8.3), reduce Briton (blue)
Resources by –30 if Military Dominance or –20 if Civilian Dominance (to a minimum of 0, and with no effect on Wealth, 1.8.4).
6.5.4 Saxon Revenue. Add Saxon Renown equal to Prosperity
under Saxon Control.
6.5.5 Scotti Revenue. Add Scotti Renown equal to the number
of non-Foederati Scotti Settlements on the map.

6.6 Upkeep Phase
Each Faction, in the order listed below, makes choices and
adjustments as specified below. Adjust Control as needed (1.6).
6.6.1 Dux Upkeep. Dux stows Plunder, pays Resources, then
redeploys Cavalry and red Foederati as follows.
•	 First remove all Plunder carried by Dux and add the number
of cubes removed to Dux Resources (1 for 1).
•	 Then the Dux chooses for each (red) Fort on the map whether
to pay 1 Resource or to remove it to Available.
If under Autonomy (6.8.4) and Roads remain
•	
Maintained, the Dux chooses either to pay 10
Resources to Maintain the Roads or to flip the
Roads Maintained marker permanently to Not
Maintained (1.3.3).
•	 The Dux relocates all Cavalry on the map to any spaces with
Forts. (Cavalry in spaces without Forts must relocate; Cavalry
already at Forts may do so. If the map has no Dux Forts, Cavalry
stay put.)
•	 Then the Dux must relocate all red Foederati to red Foederati
Settlements of their Barbarian Nation or—if no such
Settlements are left on the map—remove all red Foederati
markers of that Nation.
•	 Put a fraction (rounded down) of Cavalry pieces in the
Casualties box into the Dux Available Forces box, as specified
by the current Imperium status on the Imperium track (6.8.5);
put all remaining Casualties into the Out of Play box.

19

•	 Then the Civitates must discard half (rounded up) of all
Refugees markers in their Available Forces box.
•	 Next, the Civitates must relocate all Militia and Comitates (blue
cubes) from spaces without a Town or Hillfort to the nearest
Town or Hillfort (counting by adjacent spaces, choosing which
spaces if equidistant). (If the map has no Towns or Hillforts,
cubes stay put.)
•	 Finally, the Civitates must relocate all blue Foederati to blue
Foederati Settlements of their Barbarian Nation or—if no such
Settlements are left on the map—remove all blue Foederati
markers of that Nation.
6.6.3 Saxon and Scotti Upkeep. Each Barbarian Faction in
turn sends its loot home, relocates to its Settlements, and finds
more renowned leaders if prior leaders have been ineffective and
become discredited.
•	 Each space where any Saxon Units are carrying Plunder (only),
the Saxons undertake an immediate Return Command (3.4.2).
•	 Then the Saxons must relocate all their (non-Foederati)
Warbands from spaces without (non-Foederati) Saxon
Strongholds to the nearest such Stronghold (choosing which
if equidistant; remove Warbands if none such).
•	 Next, if Saxon Renown is less than 10, set it to 10.
•	 Finally, the Scotti carry out the above steps (with and where
applicable to Scotti pieces instead of Saxon), but raising Scotti
Renown to 6 (instead of 10).

6.7 Recovery and Reset Phase
Before regular play resumes, some Prosperity recovers and various
game functions reset.
6.7.1 Recovery of Prosperity. In each Region with any Control
(including Barbarian, 1.6), add Prosperity cubes equal to Population (1.7, 1.3.6) as follows. First, add to the bottom row of
squares in the Region; then—only under Roman Rule—add to
the top row. No rows may hold more Prosperity than the space’s
Population; remove any excess. Finally, in each City with any
Control, add Prosperity to fill the row completely. Adjust the
Total Prosperity marker.
Important—During the Recovery Phase, Prosperity cubes
may be added to the top row of squares within each Region
only if Imperium is under Roman Rule (6.8).

6.6.2 Civitates Upkeep. As follows, return a portion of Militia to
civilian life, pay Comitates, stow Plunder, and redeploy Civitates
forces.
•	 First remove all Plunder carried by Civitates and add the number
of cubes removed to Wealth (1 for 1).
•	 Then each space, remove 1 in 3 Militia there (rounded down)
to the Civitates Available Forces box.
•	 Then the Civitates must either pay Wealth for Comitates or
remove them. Every 1 Wealth spent pays for up to 3 Comitates.
Then remove any Comitates piece for which nothing was paid
to the Civitates Available Forces box.

DESIGN NOTE: Control denotes the degree of order that allows the
population to recover from the depredations of raiders, revolts, or armies
and resume productive activity. Regions without Control are in anarchy,
stalling recovery. The erosion of Roman Rule takes with it the administrative
wherewithal for full recovery of Prosperity absent specific local care, such as
in a Train Command (3.2.1).
6.7.2 Reset. Discard all Momentum Events in play (5.4) to the
played cards pile (2.2). Shift all four Factions’ Eligibility cylinders
into the “Eligible” box (2.3.1). Play the next (already revealed,
2.3.7) card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s new
top card (2.3.7).

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

6.8 Imperium

•	 Under Roman Rule with Civilian Dominance, two-thirds
(rounded down) of Casualties go to Available, the balance Out
of Play.
•	 Under Autonomy, one-half (rounded down) of Casualties go
to Available, the balance Out of Play.
6.8.6 Recovery. During Epoch Round Recovery (6.7.1), Roman
Rule allows addition of Prosperity cubes to Regions’ bottom and
then top rows of squares; Autonomy and Fragmentation allow
addition to bottom rows only.
NOTE: Dux Train Command (3.2.1) and Events (5.0) can place Prosperity
in top rows regardless of Imperium.

The game board’s Imperium track shows the status of the Roman
Empire and the political cohesion of Roman Britain—including
which Briton Faction currently dominates politically—with a
round Imperium marker that shifts left, right, down, or (rarely) up,
among five statuses: Roman Rule with either Military or Civilian
Dominance, Autonomy with either Military or Civilian Dominance, and Fragmentation (without any Dominance). Imperium
status shifts during the Imperium phase of the Epoch Round (6.2)
and via Events (5.0)—including Epoch Events (2.4.1, 5.6, 6.4)
and Pivotal Events (2.3.8, 5.7) and immediately affects various
parameters as specified below.
NOTE: Imperium typically decays toward Fragmentation, which has no
Dominance. Shift “down” means toward Fragmentation, “up” toward Roman
Rule, “left” toward Military Dominance, “right” toward Civilian. Shift to a
certain Dominance must be within Roman Rule or within Autonomy, unless
otherwise specified.
6.8.1 Briton Cooperation. Until Fragmentation, Dux and
Civitates may share Resources (1.5.2, 6.8.2), their pieces within
each space determine Briton Control jointly (1.6.1), and they
fight together in Battle against Saxons or Scotti (3.6.1); under
Fragmentation, they do not.
6.8.2 Army Preemption. Under Roman Rule (at any Dominance)
and under Autonomy with Military Dominance, Dux may spend
(blue) Briton Resources without Civitates agreeing. At Autonomy
with Civilian Dominance, Dux may spend (blue) Briton Resources
only with Civitates agreement (1.5.2).

6.8.7 Victory. Imperium status is crucial for Dux and Civitates
victory conditions as it affects their victory thresholds per 7.2
and 7.3 (and as shown on the Faction foldouts), and Dominance
is necessary for victory (except under Fragmentation obviously).
Also, under Fragmentation, Dux victory depends on Dux Control
rather than total Prosperity, and Saxon victory depends on Control
alone. Mark the Dux and Civitates thresholds that apply at the
current Imperium with red and blue pawns along the edge track.
DESIGN NOTE: The sliding Briton victory conditions represent the
gradual shift from protecting the Imperium in Britannia as an extension of
the Western Roman Empire or as a rump British Empire to acquiescence
in the fragmentation of the diocese into autonomous kingdoms.
NOTE: Imperium does not affect Sea Patrols (1.3.7).

7.0 Victory
Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and
on the Faction aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties
Whenever any Non-player Faction (1.5, 8.0) passes a victory check
(7.2), all players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player
does so or if none does by game end, the Faction that reached
the highest victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd-highest
comes in 2nd place, and so on. Ties go to any Non-players, then
the Civitates, then the Dux, then the Saxons.

7.2 Exceeding Victory Threshold

6.8.3. Imperial Taxation. During Epoch Round Revenue (6.5.3),
Roman Rule (only) reduces Briton (blue) Resources by –30 if
Military Dominance or –20 if Civilian Dominance (no effect on
Wealth, 1.8.4).

Check each Faction’s victory upon each Victory Phase (6.3), comparing the various victory totals (in some cases, victory markers,
1.9) to the thresholds noted on the Faction foldouts, along the
game board’s edge track, and below.

6.8.4 Road Maintenance. Under Roman Rule,
Roads are always Maintained (1.3.3). Under Autonomy, Dux during Epoch Round Upkeep either pays
or sets Roads to Not Maintained (6.6.1). Under
Fragmentation, Roads are automatically Not Maintained.

7.2.1 Dux. The Dux score equals the sum of the current Prestige
value (1.8.3) plus either total Prosperity (1.7.3, regardless of Control, 1.6) or—at Fragmentation only (6.8.7)—the sum of Prestige
plus Population under Dux Control (1.3.6, 1.6).

6.8.5 Dux Casualties. During Epoch Round Upkeep (6.5.1),
the Imperium track states the fractions of Cavalry Casualties that
return to Available or go Out of Play:
•	 Under Roman Rule with Military Dominance and under
Fragmentation, all Casualties go to Available.

Before Fragmentation, the Dux wins if Prosperity plus Prestige
exceeds:
•	 75 at Roman Rule, or
•	 60 at Autonomy;
	 …and they hold Military Dominance.

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
At Fragmentation, the Dux wins if Population under (red) Dux
Control plus Prestige exceeds 17.
7.2.2 Civitates. The Civitates score equals the Population currently under (blue) Briton Control (1.3.6, 1.6).
Before Fragmentation, the Civitates win if Briton Control exceeds:
•	 36 at Roman Rule, or
•	 27 at Autonomy;
	 …and they hold Civilian Dominance.
At Fragmentation, the Civitates win if Briton Control (Population
currently under blue, not red (Dux) Control) exceeds 16.
7.2.3 Saxons. Before Fragmentation, the Saxons win if Saxon
Renown exceeds 30 and at least 4 Saxon Settlements (including
Saxon Foederati, 1.4.3) are on the map. Regardless of Imperium,
the Saxon also win if Population under Saxon Control (1.3.6,
1.6) exceeds 10.
7.2.4 Scotti: The Scotti win (regardless of Imperium) if Scotti
Renown exceeds 45 and at least 4 Scotti Settlements (including
Scotti Foederati, 1.4.3) are on the map.
NOTE: Saxon and Scotti Available Settlement spaces show whether enough
are on map to enable such victory.

7.3 During the Final Epoch Round
If play reaches the Victory Phase (6.3) of the final Epoch Round
(2.4.2) and no Faction meets its victory conditions set forth
in 7.2, conduct an immediate Recovery Phase (6.7, unless at
Fragmentation, 6.8). Then the Faction with the highest victory
margin wins. A victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond
or short of its condition.
•	Dux: Prosperity plus Prestige – 75 at Roman Rule with Military
Dominance, or – 85 at Roman Rule with Civilian Dominance,
or – 60 at Autonomy with Military Dominance, or – 70 at
Autonomy with Civilian Dominance, or Dux Control plus
Prestige – 17 at Fragmentation.
•	Civitates: Briton Control – 38 at Roman Rule with Military
Dominance, or – 36 at Roman Rule with Civilian Dominance,
or – 31 at Autonomy with Military Dominance, or – 27 at
Autonomy with Civilian Dominance, or – 16 at Fragmentation.
•	Saxons: The higher of Saxon Renown – 50 + 5 per Saxon
Settlement on the map (only if no Fragmentation) or Saxon
Control – 10 (at any Imperium).
•	Scotti: Scotti Renown – 65 +5 per Scotti Settlement on the
map (or on Dal Riada Event card).
NOTE: The margin will be positive if the Faction has reached its goal,
negative or zero if not.
STOP! You have read all rules needed to play with four
players, or with two or three players running spare Factions
among them (1.5.1).

21

8.0 Non-Players
This section governs an option to substitute game-run Factions
for players when fewer than four players are at hand, including
for solitaire (1.5).
NOTE: If players are running all four Factions, this section and its accompanying charts are not needed!
A unique “Non-player” can run each of up to any three Factions
missing a player. The first four subsections (8.1-8.4) below apply
to all Non-player Factions, the next four cover specifics of each
Non-player Faction in turn (8.5-8.8), and the last covers solitaire
(“1-player”) roles and outcomes (8.9).
These rules are summarized on various Non-player aids including:
•	 A Non-Player Guidelines Summary of key rules from sections
8.1-8.4, Random Spaces (8.3.3), Battle Tactics (8.4.2), and
Raider Assault (8.5.3-.4, 8.6.4-.5) sheet.
•	 An Event Instructions foldout list (8.2.1).
•	 A foldout of separate flowcharts for each Non-player (8.5-8.8).
TERMS: Unless otherwise specified, the use in Non-player rules
and charts of:
•	 “Scotti”, “Saxon”, or “Barbarian” without “Foederati” mean
non-Foederati (1.4.3).
•	 “Control” (such as in “player Control”) includes Briton Control
for both the Civitates and—unless Fragmentation (1.6.1)—the
Dux.
•	 “Most Control” means Controlled Population (1.6, 7.2), not
number of Control markers or spaces.
•	 “Victory”, “above victory”, and “at victory” refer merely to
how a Faction is currently marked along the edge track in
comparison to its threshold and disregard the victory effects
of Settlements or Dominance (use 7.2, not 7.3).
Important: Non-players follow the same rules as players
—normal Resource and Renown costs, requirements, and
procedures apply—EXCEPT as specified in rule 8.1.2 (Commands not Limited).

8.1 Non-Players and Sequence of Play
A Faction run by rules section 8 is a Non-player. Whenever such
a Non-player Faction has an opportunity to act by the Sequence
of Play (2.3), consult its Non-player flowchart sheet and the
corresponding rules herein (8.5-8.8) to determine its actions, such
as which Command it will execute, or whether it will opt for an
Event, or will Pass.
8.1.1 Command or Event? When a Non player has a choice
between Event and Command, the flowchart will show which
it selects. In general, Non-players decline the following Events:
•	 Ineffective Events—those that, in the current situation and
following any relevant Non-player instructions (see 3rd bullet
below and 8.2.1), either would have no effect or would merely
remove own pieces (EXAMPLE: placing a type of piece that is not
Available). “Effective” Events are those that do have an effect.
Adding or removing a Capability or Momentum (5.3, 5.4) is an
effect.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
“Do Not Play” Events noted by a raven at that
Faction’s symbol on that Event card and on the Nonplayer Instructions foldout list (8.2.1).
Some Non-Player Instruction Events noted by a
sword, when their added preconditions are not met
(8.2.1, rendering the Event “Ineffective” as described
above).

INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: Early in a game, Non-player
Dux is Eligible to play unshaded “Pelagius”, which adds Prosperity. All
spaces are still at full Prosperity, so nothing would happen. The Dux instead
will either opt for a Command and Feat or Pass.
8.1.2 Non-Player Commands Not Limited. When a 2nd
Eligible Non-player by the Sequence of Play is to execute a
Limited Command (2.3.4-.5), the Non-player instead receives a
full Command plus Feat option. NOTE: A Command only by Event,
such as Scotti free Raid via shaded “Ard Ri” remains Command only and
does not add a Feat.
DESIGN NOTE: Non-players receive this benefit to aid them against
cleverer human players. A 1-player “Easy” option dampens the benefit for
a less strenuous solitaire challenge.
8.1.3 Non-Player Pivotal Events. Whenever a Non-player Faction has an unplayed Pivotal Event (5.7) whose precondition for
execution (if any) is met, the Non-player will execute the Pivotal
Event as soon as Eligible on the Sequence of Play (2.3, 2.3.8) and
that card’s Non-player Event Instruction (8.2.1) is met (possibly
trumping another Pivotal Event, 2.3.8). Each such condition for
playing a Non-player Faction’s Pivotal Event is found both on
the Non-Player Event Instructions list (8.2.1) and in a box on
that Non-player’s flowchart sheet.
8.1.4 Reading the Flowcharts. The Non-Player flowcharts show
priorities with circled numbers (e.g., , , , ) and letters (e.g.,
, ) to indicate their order and nature:
•	 Numbered priorities (e.g., , ) are sequential priorities. Execute
the instructions in each sequential priority to the maximum
extent before moving to the next sequential priority (8.3). Some
top-level sequential priorities (black circles; e.g., , ) contain
further sequential priorities (white circles; e.g., , ) that are
parts of and sequential steps to that top-level priority.
•	 Lettered priorities (e.g., , ) are nested priorities. Nested
priorities act as tie breakers within the sequential priorities to
which they are ordained. Each nested priority further narrows
the thus-far selected set of spaces. For readability, nested
priorities have a shaded background.
PLAY NOTE REGARDING NON-PLAYER RULES: We strongly
recommend that you refer to the charts first and only consult the following rules
sections 8.2-8.8 as questions arise. See also the examples in the Playbook.
If playing solitaire, see 8.9.

8.2 Executing Events
When a Non-player is to execute an Event, apply the following.

8.2.1 Instructions. Certain Events have instructions for Nonplayer Factions. The cards for these Events have the following
gray symbols at the edges of that Faction’s symbol as a cue, which
are also found on the Non-Player Event Instructions foldout list:
	 = Priority play	
	 = Special Instructions	

	 = also has Instruction
	 = Do not play

A shield indicates that the Non-player has a higher
likelihood of choosing to execute the Event. Such
Events appear earlier in that Non-player’s flowchart.
A few of them—for the Non-player Civitates and Dux
only—that bear a sword and a shield have special
Instructions the same way that all sword Events do (see
below). NOTE: A shield Event with a sword is a shield Event.
A sword indicates that the Event has special instructions
for that Non-player Faction on the Non-Player Instructions foldout, about how that Non-player will execute the
Event or added preconditions for choosing to execute it.
A raven indicates that that Non-player Faction will
always decline that Event and instead execute Command
and Feat or perhaps Pass (8.1.1).
When a Faction executes an Event that gives actions to another,
Non-player Faction, the 2nd Faction’s Event special instructions
(if any) apply to how it executes them.
EXAMPLE: A Dux player executes unshaded Event 52 “Mistborn”
and selects Non-player Civitates as the Briton that may free Muster and
may Battle. The Event has a sword for Non-player Civitates and the special
instruction “Play only where Civitates Battle condition (8.7.1) would be met
(after Muster).” Non-player Civitates would Muster per its flowchart (8.2.3,
8.7.4) then Battle—but would only do either if (after Muster) a space involved
would meet its Battle condition (8.7.1).
NOTE: Most Epoch Events (5.6) have special instructions for Briton Factions. Each Pivotal Event (5.7) has instructions regarding when the owning
Faction will play it (8.1.3).
8.2.2 Dual Use. As noted on the Non-player flowcharts, Nonplayer Barbarians opt for shaded Event text (5.2), if any, Britons
unshaded. NOTE: Instructions (8.2.1) may reverse this guidance for
certain Events.

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
8.2.3 Event-Driven Actions. Unless Instructions (8.2.1) for a
given Event specify otherwise, Non players:
•	 When by Event text are to carry out Commands and/or Feats
(5.4), follow that Faction’s Non-Player flowchart to implement
them (8.5-8.8), applying the flowchart’s conditions and priorities
to the relevant spaces. For multiple Non-player Commands
(such as “March then Battle”), start with the priorities for the
first and apply those for the second as applicable. NOTE: If a
choice among Commands, use the Faction’s flowchart to select one. If there
is a choice among Feats alone, follow the flowchart to see which Command
and Feat is selected, but ignore the Command. A Command only would
not add a Feat (8.1.2).
•	 When there is a choice of who gets Event benefits (such as
free actions, Capabilities, Resources, pieces, or Foederati marker
placement or removal), select themselves whenever possible.
Dux shift to Military Dominance and Civitates to Civilian
Dominance whenever able. EXAMPLE: Non-player Dux is up
for Event 52 “Mistborn”. Cavalry are Available and could be Trained
in a space where the Non-player Dux Battle condition (8.8.3) would be
met per the Event’s Dux special instruction (8.2.1), so Dux selects itself
as the Briton that may free Train and Battle rather than selecting the
Civitates.
•	 Within the above, when selecting spaces or other targets such
as Factions, pieces, Foederati markers, or seas per Event text,
follow the guidelines in 8.3 below.
•	 When ex¬ecuting an Event and given a choice that is not
otherwise prioritized, choose randomly among the possibilities
(8.3.2, 8.3.3).

8.3 Selecting Spaces and Targets
When executing Non-player actions, select spaces or targets per
Command and Feat priorities on the Non-Player flowcharts and
corresponding rules below (8.5-8.8), specific Event Instructions
(8.2.1) if any, general Event guidelines above (8.2.3), and otherwise
the guidelines within this section as applicable.
•	 Do so for each individual listed priority (in order), until there
are no more legal candidates or actions for that priority, or until
any space limit within that priority is reached.
•	 Then move on to the next priority and do the same, until any
overall limit for the Command, Feat, or Event is reached,
or until the Faction runs out of Resources or Renown (if
applicable).
•	 Sometimes, priorities provide a precedence of what should be
selected first; if not, select equal candidates randomly (8.3.2,
8.3.3).
•	 Unless otherwise specified, Non-players carry out whatever
actions apply to the maximum extent (such as in the most spaces
or with the most pieces allowed, and only so long as needed
pieces are Available and Resources or Renown are at hand).

23

8.3.1 Event Location and Faction Selection. Per above
guidelines for Event-driven actions (8.2.3) and within any Event
Instructions (8.2.1), Non-players select Event spaces (including
for use of Capability or Momentum effects on a limited number
of spaces, such as unshaded “Mariners By Sea”) to benefit
themselves before others and, within that, to result in the largest
effect possible (for example, in adding or subtracting Resources,
Renown, or Prestige). Unless otherwise specified, carry out actions
as fully as possible in the selected Region before moving on to
select others.
•	 Within the above (as applicable), select Event spaces to place as
many Friendly Strongholds then to remove or replace as many
enemy Strongholds as possible. (See 8.4.1 priorities among
Stronghold types once spaces have been selected.)
•	 Within that, select spaces to place as many total Friendly then
to remove or replace as many enemy pieces as possible (types
within spaces per 8.4.1).
•	 Within that, if Briton, add as many total Foederati markers
as possible, own color (1.4.3). If Barbarian, remove Foederati
markers from as many own Nation’s pieces—within that,
Strongholds—as possible; within that, remove most total
markers (including from the other Nations’ pieces), within that,
remove player before Non-player Foederati color.
•	 If Briton, flip Seas other than Septentrionalis only to
“Patrolled”. If Saxon, flip Germanicus and Britannicus only
to “No Patrol”. If Scotti, flip Hibernicus only to “No Patrol”.
8.3.2 Random Selection. Whenever equal possibilities (such
as spaces, like pieces, red or blue Foederati markers, or target
Factions) are offered to a Non-player, select among candidates
using an equal-chance die roll (D4 or D6, as appropriate) or the
Random Spaces Table for the occasional case of more than six
candidate spaces (8.3.3).
EXAMPLE: A player identifies five equal-priority spaces for a Non-player
action. The player designates each with a number “1” through “5” then rolls
a D6 to select one, re-rolling any “6”.
8.3.3 Random Spaces Table. When more than six land spaces
are equal candidates, use the Random Spaces Table to select one.
Roll a D4 and a D6 and find the space at that column and row of
the table. Follow the arrows to move down each column, then to
the top of the column at right, and from the last entry at lower
right to the first at top left, until a suitable candidate is found.
NOTE: To aid in finding spaces on the map, columns are arranged by
north, south, east, and west Britannia and names are color-coded by terrain.

8.4 Guidelines Within Spaces
Once spaces to be involved in actions are selected, apply the
following guidelines in each space, within the rules above (8.1-8.3)
and specific Non-player Faction priorities (8.5-8.8).
8.4.1 Placing, Removing, and Moving Pieces. Unless otherwise
specified, Non-players:
•	 If Briton, remove or target Barbarians (equally) first unless
Fragmentation, in which case they target all enemies equally.
If Barbarian, remove or target Britons first.

© 2017GMT Games, LLC

24

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

•	 Within that and as otherwise able, target enemy and place
Friendly Stronghold pieces first—Forts, then Towns, then
Hillforts, finally Settlements—then units—Cavalry, then
Comitates, then Warbands, then Militia, finally Raiders.
Withdraw Friendly pieces into Strongholds in the same order,
within that, those with Plunder first (3.6.3, 8.4.3).
•	 Remove Friendly pieces and place enemies in the reverse order
from above.
•	 If Briton, place non-Town Strongholds at Hillfort Sites before
Town Sites; if Barbarian, the reverse (1.3.5).
•	 Among Friendly units of the same type, remove or move those
without Plunder before those carrying Plunder (1.7.4).
•	 Remove pieces to be replaced even if no pieces are Available
to replace them.
•	 Never voluntarily remove own pieces (1.4.1).
•	 Take off-map Cavalry first from Out of Play, then Casualties,
then Available.
8.4.2 Non-Player Battle Tactics. Whenever a Non-player is or
may be attacking or defending in Battle (3.6), consult the Battle
Tactics table regarding tactical choices—such as attempts to
Evade or Ambush (3.6.2), Withdrawal into Strongholds (3.6.3),
or whether to Assault (3.6.4)—to determine its actions.
CAN RAIDER ASSAULT REMOVE STRONGHOLD? Refer
to this table in the frequent case when Battle Tactics call for
determining whether a group of Raiders would be able to remove
a Stronghold by Assault, sometimes including by Coup de Main.
Cross-reference the number of Raiders with the type of target
Stronghold. Shaded results show that that number of Raiders
would remove a Stronghold with that number of Withdrawn
units (larger numeral) or with the successful Coup de Main roll
indicated (smaller number with dice symbol).

8.5 Non-Player Scotti Actions
This subsection governs actions by the Scotti
Faction as a Non-player, as shown on the “NonPlayer Scotti” flowchart sheet. When the Scotti are Eligible by
the Sequence of Play (2.3) to take an action (and not executing
their Pivotal Event, 8.1.3), consult their flowchart—beginning at
the upper left—and, as needed, the rules below. When executing
Event-driven Commands and Feat (such as “free Raid” or “Battle
now”), consult individual flowchart boxes and rules sections below
as appropriate (8.2.3).
8.5.1 Return? Non-player Scotti begin by checking whether they
have enough Raiders or Plunder—which might be vulnerable to
Briton counterattack—on the map to merit a Return Command
(3.5.2). If the Scotti have Raiders in at least two Clear terrain
Regions, and/or have a total of at least 15 Raiders anywhere on
the map, and/or hold total number of Plunder cubes exceeding
a roll now of two six-sided dice, they immediately Return (and
Settle at the same time or perhaps Entreat afterward), as follows.
The Scotti Return Raiders and convert their Plunder into Renown:
•	 Select all spaces that have any Scotti Raiders carrying Plunder,
all Clear terrain with Scotti Raiders, and all spaces where the
Raiders would roll to place Warbands in an accompanying Settle

Feat per the priorities below. NOTE: Scotti Raider groups in Rough
terrain that have no Plunder and would be left out of a Settle Feat now
remain to await later Settle.
•	 In the special case of player use of the 1-Player Easy option, if
a Limited Command, the Scotti Return from the Region where
they hold the most Plunder (if tied, randomly among those,
8.3.2).
SETTLE: If the Scotti are Returning per above, they will Settle
as their Feat, but only if such Settle could place a Scotti piece
(including via die roll, 4.4.1 & 4.5.1, so must have pieces Available,
for example). Scotti Settle as follows (and as limited by the usual
Settle restriction that Scotti must outnumber all other pieces in
the space, 4.5.1).
•	 Settle in the space that has the most total Scotti Raiders in or
adjacent to it. If tied, select Hills first. If two or more Hills
(or no Hills) are tied for number of Raiders, select a space
with either a vacant Site (1.3.5) or a (non-Foederati) Scotti
Settlement. If several or none of those, select randomly among
the candidate spaces (8.3.2-.3).
•	 If, after rolling dice to replace Returning Raiders with Warbands,
a Settle space has three or more Scotti Warbands, replace two
Warbands with a Settlement (at a vacant Site in the Settle space,
4.5.1)—so that at least one Scotti Warband would remain there.
If that is not possible (and if there is already a Scotti Settlement
there) instead pay to place more Warbands.
ENTREAT: In the occasional instance that the Scotti did not
Settle as a Feat added to their Return Command (because Entreat
would be able to place a piece), the Scotti instead Entreat (4.5.4)
as follows. They do so also if they are Battling (see 8.5.3 below).
•	 Entreat after executing Return or, if Battling, before attacking.
Select a space (Hills with Scotti Warband, 4.5.4) where Entreat
is assured to either place a Scotti piece (by replacing Militia
and/or Hillfort) or would at least remove a Hillfort (even if no
Settlement is Available to replace it). If there are several such
potential Entreat spaces, select one randomly.
NOTE: If there is no Hills Region with a Scotti Warband and Hillfort or
Militia, or if the Scotti have less than four Renown to spend, or the best that
Entreat could do is remove Militia without placing any Warbands, then the
Scotti do not Entreat (see below).
If Scotti are Returning but can neither Settle nor Entreat per the
restrictions for those Feats and within the above priorities, they
add no Feat. If the Scotti are Battling but cannot Entreat, they
instead add a Surprise Feat per 8.5.4 below.
8.5.2 Priority Event? If the Return condition above was not met,
the Non-player Scotti check whether a high-priority Event for
them is on offer on either this or the next card, in which case they
may play the current Event or Pass for a chance to play the next:
•	
Check whether the green Scotti Faction symbol on
the current card bears a gray shield symbol (8.2.1). If
so—and if the Scotti have the option to play the
Event (because they are 1st Eligible or because the 1st Eligible
Faction used a Feat, 2.3.4)—they execute the Event. See 8.1-8.4
regarding additional guidance on how they execute the Event

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
(such as the decline of Events that are currently Ineffective,
Barbarian use of shaded text, how to select enemy targets, and
so on).
•	 If the current Event is not a Scotti “shield” Event, or if it is
but the Scotti are not able by the Sequence of Play to play an
Event now, check whether the next card showing (2.2, 2.3.7)
has the green Scotti symbol with a gray shield as either the 1st
or 2nd Faction symbol (not 3rd or 4th). If so, the Scotti Pass
(2.3.3).
8.5.3 Battle? If the Scotti neither Returned, nor played a priority Event, nor Passed for an upcoming one, they now check
whether an advantageous Battle is offered. If any space has
Scotti Warbands and those units could now Trap (via Event or
Capability, 5.1 & 5.3), could attempt Ambush (usually, in Hills,
3.6.3), and/or would be sure to Assault an enemy there, the Scotti
will Battle. A space must have an enemy in it with at least one
piece (whether unit or Stronghold) for this condition to apply.
Unless Fragmentation, count all Briton pieces together as a single
enemy (3.6.1, Briton Cooperation). Consider, in determining
whether the Scotti would Assault, whether all enemy units could
be removed in Field Battle (including with the aid of Entreat) or
could Evade or Withdraw to expose an enemy Stronghold that the
Scotti Warband(s) and Raiders (if any) there then could remove,
including by Coup de Main (and so would Assault per the Battle
Tactics table, 8.4.2).
The Scotti Battle in each space with such an enemy that they might
Trap, Ambush, or Assault. First check what Feat they may add,
if any; select where; and resolve any Entreat or Ransom before
attacking. Then execute the Battle(s).
•	 Choose the order in which spaces are resolved and among
multiple such enemies within a space (if any) so as to fight
against player before Non-player Factions. If a choice either
among player or among Non-player Factions, the Scotti first
fight the Faction marked the best against its victory threshold(s)
at the moment (7.2). (When attacking Scotti can Trap or attempt
Ambush, can Assault to remove a Stronghold including with a
possible successful Coup de Main roll, and/or can Siege, they
do so, 8.4.2).
NOTE: If the Scotti Battle in a Surprise space (4.5.2, 8.5.4) and a successful
Coup de Main roll could remove a Stronghold, the Scotti per the Battle Tactics
table (8.4.2) will Assault even if a failed roll would leave the Stronghold intact.
ENTREAT, SURPRISE, OR RANSOM: Battling Non-player
Scotti Entreat as their added Feat before attacking if able thereby
to remove or place a piece (see 8.5.1 above), otherwise Surprise
as part of Battle or Ransom before attacking, per 8.5.4 below.
8.5.4 March or Raid? If the Scotti neither Returned, nor played
or Passed for a priority Event, nor Battled, they check whether it
is time to March or launch Raids. If Scotti at this point have no
Warbands Available and would move Warbands per the March
priorities below (8.5.6), they do so, per those priorities.
If one or more Scotti Warbands remain Available, or those on
the map would not move per 8.5.6, the Scotti next check if they
will Raid. If at least 25 of the 30 Scotti Raider pieces are off-map
(either Available or in the Niall Noigiallach box, 5.3), roll a

25

six-sided die. On a roll of 1-4, the Scotti will March or Raid now;
on a 5 6, they will first check whether instead to play the current
Event per 8.5.5 below.
PLAY NOTE: Looking ahead to Event conditions (8.5.5), if a 1st
Eligible Faction has already played the current Event, or if that Event is
Ineffective (8.1.1) or has a Scotti “raven” (8.3.1), you can skip the above
die roll and go straight to Raid or March priorities below.
Otherwise, Non-player Scotti Raid up to 4 Regions (not Cities).
The first target Region (only) may be a Deep Raid (via Surprise
priorities below). The Scotti first will select up to four targets for
2D4 Raiders each, then may proceed to select targets for 1D4.
First, pay Renown (unless free) to roll 2D4 Raiders, starting with
locations reachable with the least subtraction of Raiders (such
as from Forts against Raids from Caledonia, 3.5.1), proceeding
to ever greater subtraction as needed.
•	 Within that priority, roll a six-sided die to determine which
targets to select for rolls of 2D4: if 1 4, target only up to the
rolled number (one to four) with 2D4, first selecting Regions
where Scotti pieces are already there or adjacent (regardless of
Prosperity); if 5-6, instead roll 2D4 only at Regions with at least
two Prosperity cubes, selecting those with the most Prosperity
cubes first.
•	 Within those priorities, select first Regions under Control (1.6)
by any enemy Faction. If there is still a tie among candidate
Raid targets, choose Regions that have the highest difference
in Population minus enemy Troops first (that is, the least well
defended Population), then randomly.
Then, only if already Raiding per above priorities for 2D4, or if
this is a free Raid by Event (5.5), pay (usually 0) Renown to roll
1D4 Raiders—or, if a free Raid, 2D4—at Regions reachable with
the least subtraction possible. Among Regions with the same
subtraction, select those with the most Prosperity cubes; among
ties, Hills first. (Do not use the earlier 2D4 priorities.)
Just-placed Raiders Battle only where assured of an Assault (per
the requirements of the Battle Tactics table, 8.4.2).
PLAY NOTE: Raiding Scotti thus will Battle only where Assault is sure
to remove a Stronghold regardless of enemy tactics such as Ambush rolls
or Withdrawal decisions, or will roll Coup de Main by Surprise or Event
(regardless of the Coup de Main roll needed for success, 3.6.4). Refer to
the “Can Raider Assault Remove Stronghold?” table to help determine
whether a certain number of Raiders can remove a Stronghold, including
via Coup de Main.
Niall Noigiallach: When this shaded Capability (5.3) is in effect,
modify the above priorities for the first target space of each Raid
Command as follows.
•	 If the Niall Noigiallach box has no Raiders in it, pay Renown
(unless free Raid) to add 2D4 Raiders to the box as the first
Raid target instead.
•	 If box already has Raiders in it, add all of them to the Raid’s
first target space.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

IF NO RAID: If the above Raid priorities result in no targets
being selected (due to such as lack of Renown or absence of
Prosperity), the Scotti instead check for March per 8.5.6 below
(not Event).
SURPRISE: Raiding Scotti will add Surprise as their Feat only as
needed for a Deep Raid to reach a higher priority target with the
first Region selected. Select only Regions where Prosperity cubes
exceed the number of enemy Troops there.
EXAMPLE: The first 2D4 Raid target Region that can be reached without
Deep Raid suffers no subtraction of Raiders, has two Prosperity cubes (after
a 1D6 roll of “1”), with same number of enemy Troops as Population, and
Hills terrain; the best Deep Raid target reachable by these priorities has 2
Prosperity cubes and 2 enemy Troops, but it also has all the attributes of the
first target above, so the Scotti do not use Surprise.
NOTE: In effect, if a Deep Raid is not needed to reach a better target for
the first Region Raided, then the Scotti will Ransom instead of Surprise.
Battling Scotti (8.5.3) add Surprise at the first enemy Stronghold
that they are assured of being able to Assault and where a successful Coup de Main roll would aid that Assault (regardless of
enemy Withdrawal choices) by reducing Friendly removals in
Escalade or resulting in removal of the Stronghold.
If the Scotti do not Surprise as their Feat with Raid or Battle,
they Ransom instead.
RANSOM: Raiding or Battling Scotti that did not Entreat or
Surprise as their Feat instead Ransom. NOTE: Ransom occurs before
Battle (4.5.3).
•	 They Ransom in each Battle or Raid space able (before resolving
any Battle, 4.5.3). If a choice among target Factions in a space,
they target any player Faction first (if it has the assets to pay).
If the Scotti did not Surprise and are Raiding or Battling only
in spaces where they will not be able to Ransom, they execute
no Feat.
8.5.5 Event? If the Non-player Scotti checked for Raid
but have fewer than 25 Raiders off map or rolled a 5 or
6, they check to see whether to play the current (nonshield) Event. If they may opt for an Event per the
Sequence of Play (2.3), and if the current Event would be Effective (8.1.1), and if it does not bear a gray raven behind the green
Scotti symbol, the Scotti execute the Event. Otherwise, they either
Raid per 8.5.4 above (or, if not, March per 8.5.4).
•	
Just as for a “shield” Event, see 8.1-8.4 regarding
additional guidance (such as Barbarian use of shaded
text). If the Scotti symbol on the card bears a gray
sword symbol, consult the Non-Player Event
Instructions foldout for that numbered Event.
8.5.6 March? If the Scotti checked the Raid priorities in 8.5.4
above but did not Raid, they check whether any of their Warbands
will March, as follows:
•	 Check the conditions in the “SETTLE” section below and
execute a Settle Feat now if possible.
•	 Then March with all Scotti Warbands that can reach each
space selected below, so long as they leave behind at least one
Warband per Scotti Settlement per origin space and keep all

Scotti Control they already have and add no enemy Control
by their departure. (If Warbands that might still move by
the restrictions above have not yet Marched, find a second
destination by the priorities below that at least some of those
Warbands can reach and March them there, and so on, until
either all such Warbands have Marched, no such destinations
remain that they can reach, or Renown is 0.)
•	 Move all such Warbands that can reach into first one and then
perhaps additional spaces in which the Scotti will then have
more units (Warbands and Raiders) than all enemy units total.
The space may already have more Scotti than enemy units and
may have no enemy units.
•	 If Scotti Warbands could reach multiple such spaces, start by
moving so as to remove as much Control from the destination
(by Population, 1.6, 7.2) as able of a player Faction that currently
exceeds its victory threshold (Briton Control would count as
both a Civitates player’s and—unless Fragmentation—a Dux
player’s Control, 1.6.1). If there are several such potential
destinations, start with Hill Regions (if any). If several or no
such candidate Hills, select one randomly.
•	 If there is no such player or no such removal is possible, or
if there are no more spaces reachable and the Scotti could
March additional Warbands, next March to spaces where the
move will either remove any Control of an enemy Faction or
would make the difference in enabling an immediately following
Settle Feat to place a Settlement (rather than Warbands or no
pieces, including consideration of whether a Settle Feat already
occurred ahead of the March Command and the space limit
on the Settle Feat, 4.5.1). If there are several such potential
destinations, again start with Hill Regions (if any), then selecting
randomly.
PASS: If the Scotti checked for possible Raid and March but
could execute neither, they Pass instead.
SETTLE: If the Scotti March, they Settle as their Feat, as follows
(in a space where they outnumber other’s pieces, 4.5.1, even if
not a March space).
•	 If they can place Settlement before Marching, while ending
with Scotti Control in the Settle space (whether or not they
began with any), they do so. If they can so place a Settlement
only after Marching, they do that instead.
•	 If they cannot place a Settlement, they instead place the most
Warbands they can (either before or after Marching),
If Settle cannot place any pieces, the Scotti execute no Feat with
their March.
8.5.7 Saxon Deep Raid and Ravage. In the rare instance of
Saxon Surprise Deep Raid where Non-player Scotti Control (4.4.2)
or Ravage where Scotti units (4.4.3), the Scotti force a Battle by
attacking the Raiding or Ravaging Saxon units if and only if the
Saxon Faction is being run by a player.

8.6 Non-Player Saxon Actions
This subsection governs actions by the Saxon
Faction as a Non-player (when Eligible to take an
action and not executing its Pivotal Event, 8.1.3), as shown on
the “Non-Player Saxons” flowchart sheet.
8.6.1 Return? Like Non-player Scotti, Non-player Saxons begin
by checking whether they have enough Raiders or Plunder on the
map to merit a Return (3.4.2). If they have Raiders in at least two
Clear terrain Regions, and/or have a total of at least 15 Raiders
anywhere on the map, and/or hold a total number of Plunder
cubes exceeding a roll of two six-sided dice, they Return (and
Settle at the same time), as follows.
The Saxons Return Raiders and convert their Plunder into
Renown:
•	 Select all spaces that have any Saxon Raiders carrying Plunder,
all Clear terrain with Saxon Raiders, and all spaces where the
Raiders would roll to place Warbands in an accompanying Settle
Feat per the priorities below.
•	 In the special case of player use of the 1-Player Easy option,
if a Limited Command, the Saxons Return from the Region
where they hold the most Plunder (if tied, randomly among
those, 8.3.2).
SETTLE: If the Saxons are Returning per above or Marching
per 8.6.3 below, they will Settle as their Feat as follows (in one
space where their pieces outnumber all others’, 4.4.1, or up to two
spaces with shaded Thanet Capability, 5.3). If Marching, they
Settle before any movement, if possible thereby to select Settle
space(s) per the priorities below (a space that would be sure of
adding pieces or Population). If Marching but able to select such
a space until after movement, they do that instead. If not able to
add something with March—or if the Command is already Return
not March—they Return and Settle instead (even if no Returning
Raiders, 8.6.3). EXAMPLE: If Settle before March would not be sure
to add something such as a Settlement but it would after March, the Saxons
Settle after March; if both would, the Saxons Settle before March.
NOTE: Non-player Saxons that are to March and Settle and can fulfill Settle
but not March priorities instead Return with Settle (8.6.3).
Non-player Saxons:
•	 Settle first where they are certain to add something (pieces or
Population). NOTE: Do not here consider rolls for Returning Raiders,
which are uncertain. Within that, they choose where they will add
the most Saxon Controlled Population able (7.2, by adding
either Control or Population by the priorities below). If two
or more tied for how much Control they will add, they choose
where the most Returning Saxon Raiders in or adjacent; and,
if that count is tied, Fens first, if any.
•	 If there is no such space where Settle is allowed, they Settle
in a space that has any Returning Saxon Raiders in or adjacent
to it, first where the most such Raiders total. If two or more
spaces are tied for the number of nearby Raiders, Settle first
in Fens terrain. NOTE: If shaded Thanet is in effect, count each
Raider only once in choosing two Settle spaces (that is, select the second
space considering only Raiders not already considered for the first).
In the Settle space(s):

27

•	 If Returning, first roll to replace Returning Raiders (if any)
with Warbands.
•	 Next, replace Warbands with a Settlement and then (whether or
not a Settlement was added) with added Population as able, but
only so as to end the Feat with the space under Saxon Control
(whether or not it began with Saxon Control) with at least two
(non-Foederati) Saxon Warbands per Saxon Settlement in the
space.
•	 If neither Settlement nor Population could be added (within
those restrictions), place Warbands by paying Renown where
able to place two or more Warbands in a space (only) or if the
Settle Feat is free (paying 0 Renown, 5.5).
If no Warbands, Settlement, or Population could be added by
the above priorities (including because only Warbands could be
added but no Saxon Warbands are Available), the Saxons add no
Feat to their Return or March.
8.6.2 Priority Event? Again like the Scotti, the Non-player
Saxons, if they did not Return, check for a high-priority Event:
If the current card’s black Saxon symbol has a gray
•	
shield (8.2.1)—and if the Saxons have the option to
play the Event (because they are 1st Eligible or
because the 1st Eligible Faction used a Feat, 2.3.4)—they do
so.
•	 If the current Event is not a Saxon “shield” Event, or if it is
but the Saxons are not able by the Sequence of Play to play
an Event now, check whether the next card showing has the
black Saxon symbol with a gray shield as either the 1st or 2nd
Faction symbol (not 3rd or 4th). If so, the Saxons Pass now.
8.6.3 March? Unlike the Scotti, the Non-player Saxons next
check for March. They may March (or perhaps Return instead)
now if each of two conditions is met: first, that a six-sided die
roll now results in a 1-2; second, that a Settle Feat now (either
with or without March movement) would be certain to add something—either a Settlement, Population, or at least two Warbands,
regardless of any die rolls (for Settle by any Returning Raiders).
If both conditions obtain, Saxon Warbands might March.
PLAY NOTE: First, roll to see if a roll of 1-2 is obtained. If so, then
check what the prospects for a Settle Feat would be both before and after
any movement of Warbands, per the Settle Feat priorities in 8.6.1 above.
Move Warbands as follows (perhaps after Settling, 8.6.1):
•	 March Saxon Warbands beyond those needed to leave behind
at least two Warbands per Saxon Settlement per origin space,
and to keep all Saxon Control already on the map, and add
no enemy Control by any departure. NOTE: If Warbands from
multiple origins might March, determine which moves first randomly.
•	 Move such Warbands that can reach each space selected below
in turn only as needed to meet the priority there, into first one
destination, then perhaps others. Move Warbands so that the
Saxons will have exactly four more Warbands than all enemy
Troops (not Raiders or Strongholds) total (including if the
space has no enemies). If Saxons could reach more than one
such space, start by moving so as to remove as much Control
as able from the destination (by Population, 1.6, 7.2) of a player
Faction that currently exceeds its victory threshold (8.0; Briton

© 2017GMT Games, LLC

28

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

Control counts as Control by both Civitates and Dux, unless
Fragmentation, 1.6.1). If no such player or no such removal
possible, instead move only so as to remove Control by any
Faction or so as to enable an immediately following Saxon
Settle Feat to place a Settlement. Among all such destinations,
chose Fens first, if any. Select additional destinations by the
same restrictions and priorities for any Warbands that could
March per above but have not done so.
IF NO MARCH: If Settle would be sure to place something (per
8.6.1 above), but no Warbands can move per above (whether
because Saxon Control, enough Warbands, or Renown is lacking)—even after considering what Settle would add before or after
movement—the Saxons now Return instead and Settle with that,
per 8.6.1. If Saxons have no Raiders or Plunder, select a space
with Warbands (to no effect except to provide a Command to
accompany Settle).
NOTE: In effect, Non-player Saxons who will benefit from a Settle Feat and
roll a 1-2 proceed to Settle, Marching if possible, Returning (for cost 0) if not.
8.6.4 Battle? If the Saxons neither Returned, nor played or Passed
for a priority Event, nor Marched (including because they rolled
3-6), they may Battle. If any Saxon Warband(s) with a Battle
Command would be sure to remove at least one enemy’s last unit
there and/or would be sure to Assault per the Battle Tactics table
(8.4.2), they do so now. Treat Britons before Fragmentation as a
single enemy (3.6). Also consider:
•	 That any Saxon Raiders in the space would fight together with
the Saxon Warbands.
•	 Whether an enemy might Evade, Ambush, or Withdraw.
•	 Whether the Saxons will add Shield Wall, Ravage, or Surprise,
per the priorities below.
•	 That the Saxons by the priorities below will Assault only if sure
to remove the Stronghold or if attempting a Coup de Main.
•	 That an enemy’s last unit might be removed by Siege (3.6.6)
The Saxons Battle in each space with such an enemy, against that
enemy. If multiple such enemies in a space (Britons and Scotti,
or both Britons at Fragmentation, for example), the Saxons fight
player before Non-player Factions; within that, the Faction doing
the best against its victory threshold (7.2). (When attacking Saxons
can Trap or attempt Ambush, can Assault to remove a Stronghold
including with a possible successful Coup de Main roll, and/or
can Siege, they do so, per the Battle Tactics table, 8.4.2).
SHIELD WALL, RAVAGE, OR SURPRISE: Battling Non-player
Saxons use Shield Wall as their added Feat if Shield Wall could
lessen their removals in a prospective Field Battle (8.4.2) from
which not all enemy units could Withdraw into Strongholds,
otherwise Ravage or Surprise per 8.6.5 below.
8.6.5 Raid? If the Saxons neither Returned, nor played or Passed
for a priority Event, nor Marched or Battled, they check whether
to Raid. If at least 20 of the 25 Saxon Raider pieces are Available,
roll a six-sided die. On a roll of 1-4, the Saxons Raid now; on a 5
6, they will first check whether instead to play the current Event
per 8.6.6 below.

The Saxons Raid up to 3 Regions (not Cities). The first target
Region (only) may be a Deep Raid (provided that the Saxons will
not Ravage, and via Surprise priorities below).
PLAY NOTE: Look ahead to Ravage and Raid boxes or priorities below,
to determine now whether the Saxons will Ravage or instead Surprise to
allow a possible Deep Raid.
First, pay Renown (unless free) to roll 3D4 Raiders at Regions
under enemy Control (1.6) and/or (with equal priority) with at
least two Prosperity cubes.
•	 Within the above priorities, first select Regions reachable with
the least subtraction of Raiders.
•	 To choose among multiple such Regions, next roll a six-sided
die: if 1 4, first select Regions with the highest difference in
Population value minus the number of enemy Troops there
(that is, the least well defended Population); if 5-6, instead first
target Fens (within that, choosing randomly).
Second, pay to roll 1D4 at additional Regions only as reachable
with no net subtraction of Raiders (accounting for Event effects as
wells as Patrolled Seas) and holding at least one Prosperity cube.
Or, if this is a free Raid (5.5), roll 3D4 at target Regions with the
most Prosperity reachable. Within either of those restrictions,
select Fens first.
Just-placed Raiders Battle only where assured of an Assault (per
the requirements of the Battle Tactics table, 8.4.2, either that a
Stronghold is sure to be removed or that a Coup de Main that
could do so will be attempted).
PLAY NOTE: Refer to the “Can Raider Assault Remove Stronghold?”
table to help determine whether a certain number of Raiders can remove a
Stronghold, including via Coup de Main.
PASS: If no such Raid is possible (for example, due to lack of
Renown), the Saxons Pass.
RAVAGE: Non-player Saxons only add Ravage as a Feat with Raid
if either the Dux or Civitates Faction before the Raid is marked
just 2 edge track boxes below its victory threshold number or
better (7.2). They do so with Battle only to enable them to take
more Plunder than otherwise (3.4.4, 4.4.3).
•	 If they do Ravage, they do so only where the number of
Prosperity cubes exceeds the Population value (before the Raid
or Battle) or—if no such Battle or Raid Regions—in just one
Region that is under enemy Control (1.6), choosing first the
candidate Region that has the most enemy pieces in it. NOTE:
The latter priority minimizes the occasions in which Ravage will deny the
Saxons a successful Assault, but also carries the risk of a worse forced
Battle.
EXAMPLE: Saxons are Raiding and the Dux at Roman Rule have
Prosperity+Prestige at 73, just 2 below its victory threshold number of 75,
but none of the three Raid targets has more Prosperity than Population. The
Saxons Ravage only one Raid Region that has Briton Control and a Fort and
3 Troops (four pieces), more pieces than any other target.
If the situation does not meet the above Ravage requirements,
the Saxons instead add Surprise.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
PLAY NOTE: Rarely, the overall Ravage requirement regarding Briton
victory is met, but—once Raid targets are selected—none of them meets
the Region-specific Ravage requirements regarding Prosperity or Control;
in that case, the Saxons will use Surprise without Deep Raid in one of the
target Regions already selected, per the priorities below.
SURPRISE: If the Saxons did not add Shield Wall or Ravage, they
use Surprise in one Raid or Battle space as follows.
•	 With Raid to enable a Deep Raid to reach a higher priority
Raid target for the first target Region than otherwise could be
reached.
•	 If Battling or if no such Deep Raid is possible, at an enemy
Stronghold in a Battle or Raid Region (if Battle, belonging to
the enemy targeted in the Battle); if several such Strongholds,
they choose the one protected by the fewest enemy Troops (in
hopes of Assaulting it with Coup de Main).
EXAMPLE: The Saxons’ first Raid cannot reach any better target with Deep
Raid, but has selected three Regions, two of which have Briton Strongholds.
Imperium is not yet at Fragmentation, so the Britons fight together as a single
enemy. The Saxons use Surprise in the one of the two Raid Regions that has
a Briton Stronghold and the fewest combined Briton Troops.
If the Saxons do not use Surprise as their Feat with Raid or Battle,
they use no Feat.
8.6.6 Event? If the Non-player Saxons checked for Raid
but have fewer than 20 Raiders Available or rolled a 5
or 6, they check to see whether to play the current (nonshield) Event. If they may opt for an Event per the Sequence of
Play (2.3), and if the current Event would be Effective (8.1.1),
and if it does not bear a gray raven behind the black Saxon
symbol, the Saxons execute the Event. Otherwise, they Raid per
8.6.5 above.
•	
Just as for a “shield” Event, see 8.1-8.4 regarding
additional guidance (such as Barbarian use of shaded
text). If the Saxon symbol on the card bears a gray
sword, consult the Non-Player Event Instructions
foldout for that numbered Event.
8.6.7 Scotti Deep Raid. In the rare instance of Scotti Surprise
Deep Raid where Non-player Saxon Control (4.5.2), the Saxons
force a Battle by attacking the Raiding or Ravaging Scotti units if
and only if the Scotti Faction is being run by a player.

8.7 Non-Player Civitates Actions
This subsection governs actions by the Civitates
Faction as a Non-player (when Eligible to take an
action and not executing their Pivotal Event, 8.1.3), as shown on
the “Non-Player Civitates” flowchart sheet.
8.7.1 Battle? Non-player Civitates first check whether they will
Battle, especially to win Control of a space or take Plunder. They
Battle if they would be ensured in at least one space of adding
Briton Control (by removing enough enemy pieces to obtain a
Friendly majority where there is already a Friendly Stronghold,
1.6) and/or of taking Plunder onto Civitates units exceeding the
roll now of one six-sided die (by removing enemy units carrying
Plunder or enemy Strongholds, 3.6.5). In weighing this condition,

29

ignore any possible Civitates Feat (Pillage or Reinforce), any possible Evasion by the enemy, and any possible Ambush by either side
in determining what Control or Plunder the Civitates might win.
If the Civitates Battle now, they first add a Pillage or Reinforce
Feat (see below) then attack in spaces with potential enemies
only as follows.
•	 First, if the Dux is a player and its victory margin is positive
(disregarding Dominance, 7.2, 8.0), Civitates forces now attack
the Dux in each space where the attack would be sure to remove
a Fort (regardless of Imperium or what situations triggered
the Civitates Battle condition above). NOTE: The Non-player
Civitates with the Dux threatening victory may effect a Briton civil war
in an attempt to reduce Prestige or Dux Control.
•	 Then Civitates attack enemy Factions (Barbarians and/or,
during Fragmentation, Dux) wherever they have the possibility
of adding (blue) Briton Control or taking away an enemy’s
Plunder (taking any added Pillage or Reinforce and other
Non-player tactics into account, 8.4.2, and even if Civitates
units there have no room to carry more). They first select
spaces and enemies to attack Factions with doing the best
against their victory thresholds (7.2) that they face and meet
that requirement. NOTE: Like other Non-players, Civitates forces
Ambush (if Foederati), Assault, and/or Siege per the Battle Tactics
table (8.4.2).
PILLAGE: Civitates before Battling as their Feat add Pillage for
all Plunder that they are able to gain and reduce all Renown and
Prestige able.
If Civitates are unable to Pillage any Prosperity before Battle,
they Reinforce instead.
REINFORCE: Non-player Civitates adding a Reinforce Feat to
Battle execute the Reinforce before resolving Battles and spend
no Wealth (1.8.4) to Reinforce even when their Resources reach
0. They attempt to Reinforce as follows.
•	 First, to Muster in Battle spaces where doing so will place
Militia, first in spaces where the added Militia could enable the
attack to remove more enemy pieces than otherwise.
•	 Then, in just one non-Battle space, roll to attempt to move
Troops to an adjacent Battle where enough units could arrive
to remove more enemy than otherwise; select units per the
order specified in 8.4.1 for Friendly unit placement.
If there is no Battle for which Muster could add or move in
Troops to remove more enemies, the Civitates add no Feat to
the Battle Command.
8.7.2 Priority Event? If Civitates did not Battle, they check for
a high-priority Event:
•	
If the current card’s blue Civitates symbol has a gray
shield (8.2.1)—and if the Civitates have the option
to play the Event by the Sequence of Play (2.3.4)—
they do so. See 8.1-8.4 for guidance (such as Briton use of
unshaded text) and check for Event Instructions (those few
Civitates shield Events that also bear a sword have them).
•	 If the current Event is not a Civitates “shield” Event, or if
it is but the Civitates may not by Sequence play it now, check
whether the next card showing has the blue Civitates symbol

© 2017GMT Games, LLC

30

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

with a gray shield (with or without a sword over the shield) as
either the 1st or 2nd Faction symbol (not 3rd or 4th). If so,
the Civitates Pass.

PILLAGE: After Marching, Civitates as their Feat add Pillage
for all Plunder that they are able to gain and reduce all Renown
and Prestige able.

8.7.3 March? If the Civitates checked for shield Events and
neither played one nor Passed, roll a six-sided die. If the roll is
“1” or “2”, and if current Briton (blue) Resources exceed 10, and
if a March Command now would result in any forces moving, the
Civitates March (before adding any Feat).

If Civitates are unable to Pillage any Prosperity after March, they
Rule or Invite instead.

Non-player Civitates March as follows; they spend no Wealth to
do so (1.8.4), even if Resources hit 0.
Select to up to four destination Regions (not Cities) which Civitates forces could reach by March:
•	 First, select just one destination Region that has a Stronghold
belonging to an enemy Faction (so not a Dux Stronghold,
unless at Fragmentation) that currently has the best standing on
the edge track relative to its victory threshold(s) (7.2). NOTE:
There may be no such Region, if at Roman Rule or Autonomy and the
Barbarians have no Strongholds of their own.
•	 Then, select additional destination Regions (up to four total)
that do not have (blue) Briton Control, first choosing among
such Regions that have any non-Foederati Barbarian pieces in
them.
NOTE: Non-player Civitates do not March to Cities.
Having selected potential destinations, select origin spaces that
have (blue) Briton Control and up to equal in number to whatever
the total number of those destinations, by the follow priority:
•	 Select first as origins those spaces whence the most Troops will
be able to reach the highest priority destination above where no
Marching Troops will yet have arrived (then choosing randomly
within that priority).
•	 Never split any origin’s moving forces among more than one
destination. NOTE: It is only possible that groups from two or more
origin spaces March to the same destination when Militia join Comitates
or blue Foederati Warbands on the latter’s way in along Roads. In most
cases, each origin will send forces to a different destination.
From each selected origin, move with all Civitates (and possibly
Dux) units but for two Friendly Troops there per Friendly
Stronghold and without losing any Briton Control. Within that:
•	 Take Dux forces along (as allowed by Imperium state and
Dux permission, 3.3.2) only to Barbarian Strongholds or other
Barbarian pieces that caused their Region to be selected as a
destination above.
•	 As able within all the above March priorities, move a single
adjacent Militia into each destination, then move in Cavalry,
then Comitates, then any Foederati (blue or red), then additional
Militia.

RULE: After executing their Command (and, with March, after
checking for Pillage), Civitates add Rule as their Feat (in up to
three spaces) as follows.
•	 First, select Rule spaces so as to transfer the most Plunder held
by Civitates units to Wealth possible.
•	 Then—among the spaces selected above then in other spaces as
needed—pay Resources (only, use no Wealth) to add Population.
•	 Then, if the Dux is a player and Dux’s currently marked victory
is within 2 of its victory number on the edge track or above
it (7.2), spend Wealth to reduce Prestige (among added spaces
as needed).
•	 Finally, convert Resources into Wealth, but only until 8 blue
Resources still remain.
If no such Rule is possible, Civitates Invite instead.
INVITE: Civitates after checking for but failing to Rule might
add Invite as their Feat (if not Fragmentation, 4.2.2, 6.8) after
their Command.
•	 First determine which Barbarian Nation’s Foederati the Civitates
might Invite by rolling a six-sided die—if the roll is a 1-3,
Civitates will only Invite Scotti on this Feat; if 4 6, only Saxons.
•	 Place Foederati of that Nation at a vacant Site (where Briton
Control and already a Civitates piece, 4.3.2) and only if there is
no blue Foederati Settlement of that Nation already on the map.
NOTE: Non-player Civitates do not replace Hillforts with Settlements
when Inviting Foederati. Rarely, they may place just a Settlement if no
Warbands of the chosen Nation are Available.
•	 If Civitates cannot place any new Foederati of the chosen
Nation, and if the Dux Faction is a player (rather than a Nonplayer), Civitates instead pays to convert the most red Foederati
to blue (of either Nation) that it can.
If Civitates could neither Pillage nor Rule and do not Invite
(because there is not suitable vacant Site, there are already too
many of the rolled Nation’s Foederati Settlements out, or Imperium is at Fragmentation, 4.2.2), they add no Feat.
8.7.4 Muster? If the Civitates checked for but did not March
(including because of a March condition roll of 3-6), roll 2D6
now and compare the result to the number of Troops (Militia
plus Comitates) in the Civitates Available box. If the number
of Troop cubes there exceeds that dice roll—or if Muster now
(alone, without considering Rule or Invite) would add any Briton
Control—the Civitates now Muster as follows. NOTE: Muster can
add Control by placing a Stronghold or enough Troops to outnumber enemies
countering a Friendly Stronghold (1.6, 3.3.1).

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

31

Civitates Muster before adding any Feat and may spend Wealth
once out of Resources to do so, selecting spaces and actions as
follows.
•	 First, replace Militia with Hillforts so as to add the most Briton
Controlled Population possible (spending Wealth if blue
Resources reach 0).
•	 Then, place the most Comitates possible from Available
(spending the needed Wealth); next—without spending any
Wealth—place as many Militia from Available as able.
•	 Finally, place Towns only until there are at least six Towns
already on the map (spending the needed Wealth); replace two
Militia with a Town if able before replacing any Hillforts.

8.7.8 Cooperation. In the absence of Preemption (1.5.2), Nonplayer Civitates agree to any use of (blue) Briton Resources by
either player or Non player Dux only so long as the Dux is doing
worse (lower) against its victory threshold (7.3) than are the
Civitates. Also, Non-player Civitates:
•	 Never give Tribute to Barbarians or Wealth to Dux Resources
(1.5.2).
•	 Allow Dux to move Civitates pieces (3.2.2) only if the Dux is
a Non-player, never with a Dux player.

If no such Muster is possible (perhaps due to lack of Resources
or Wealth), the Civitates instead Trade per 8.7.6 below.

8.7.9 Barbarian Deep Raid and Saxon Ravage. Whenever
Non-player Civitates forces are present and have Friendly Control
for a Barbarian Surprise Deep Raid (4.4.2, 4.5.2) or are present
where a Saxon Ravage Feat (4.4.3), the Civitates force a Battle
by attacking the Raiding or Ravaging units if and only if there
is no possibility in that Battle of the last Friendly Troop in the
space being removed (including consideration of possible Battle
tactics, 3.6, 8.4.2).

RULE OR INVITE: After Muster, the Civitates Rule or Invite
per 8.7.3 above.
8.7.5 Event? If Civitates checked but did not meet the
condition for Muster above, they might play the current
(non-shield) Event. If they the Sequence of Play (2.3)
gives them the option for an Event, and if the current
Event would be Effective (8.1.1) and does not bear a gray raven
behind the blue Civitates symbol, they execute the Event now
(per 8.1-8.4, unshaded text).
•	

If the Civitates symbol on the card bears a gray sword,
check the Non-Player Event Instructions for that Event
(8.2.1).

8.7.6 Trade? If the Civitates checked for the ability to play an
Effective Event but could not, or attempted to Muster but could
not (perhaps lacking the Resources), they instead Trade as follows.
•	 Trade to add at least 4 blue Resources and as many Resources
as able.
•	 If and only if Civitates added Resources above and the current
situation in an Imperium Phase—were it to occur now—would
result in a shift down from Roman Rule or Autonomy to
Fragmentation (6.2.2, so not if at Fragmentation already), pay
to add the most Prosperity able.
RULE OR INVITE: After Trading, the Civitates Rule or Invite
per 8.7.3 above.
PASS: If the Civitates attempt to Trade but cannot add at least 4
Resources, they Pass instead.
8.7.7 Epoch Round. The Non-player Civitates make decisions
during the Epoch Round as follows:
•	 Pay Annona for its Foederati in the highest number of spaces
that it can afford (6.1), choosing any unpaid spaces at random
(8.3.3).
•	 Hoard as much Wealth as they can (6.2.1).
•	 Pay Wealth in Upkeep to keep as many Comitates on the map
as able (selecting those that must be removed randomly by
space, 8.3.3).
•	 Relocate their Troops, whenever a choice, so as to keep or add
the most Briton Control by Population, otherwise randomly.

NOTE: Per the Battle Tactics table (8.4.2), Non player Dux, unless at
Fragmentation, admits Civitates forces that seek to Withdraw into Dux
Strongholds (3.6.3).

8.8 Non-Player Dux Actions
This subsection governs actions by the Dux Faction
when a Non-player (when Eligible to take an action
and not executing its Pivotal Event, 8.1.3), as shown on the
“Non-Player Dux” flowchart sheet.
8.8.1 Intercept? The Non-player Dux first checks whether the
situation and its priorities would enable it to Intercept and Battle
with enough Raiders. Roll two six-sided dice. If the number of
Raiders on the map, the board situation, Resources, and the
priorities and restrictions below would be sure to enable the Dux
during an Intercept Command now to engage more total Raider
pieces in Battle that that 2D6 roll (regardless of how many might
Evade or would be removed), the Dux Intercepts now. The Dux
might Invite Foederati at the outset of the Intercept Command,
so first check whether the Dux will add a Retaliate or (more likely)
Invite Feat, per those sections below; if Invite, resolve that Feat
before Intercepting. Once the nature of the accompanying Feat
is determined, the Dux Intercepts as follows.
Intercept to provide the opportunity to remove the most total
Raider pieces possible (ignoring the chance of Evasion) within
the following restrictions.
•	 Determine potential target Intercept spaces (those with any
Raiders and Friendly Control, 3.2.3, whether or not they
already contain Dux Troops or can be reached). Move from
the fewest Friendly Control spaces (only, paying 2 Resources
each) needed for enough Dux Troops to reach target spaces to
that the maximum number Raiders might be engaged in Battle.
Move red Foederati first, then Cavalry, as needed.
•	 Leave one Friendly Troop (possibly Civitates) per Fort in each
origin space (ignoring other Strongholds). Move any Dux
Troops beyond that restriction only as individually needed to
be able to remove as many Raiders as possible. Once enough
Troops are present at a target group of Raiders to have the
possibility of removing all of them in Battle, continue on

© 2017GMT Games, LLC

32

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

to consider movement to the next target space, and so on.
NOTE: Moving groups might divide or might end up at the same target.
EXAMPLE: If three Cavalry could reach a target Region with only
two Raiders in it, only one Cavalry would move there, because additional
Cavalry would not help remove those Raiders. The remaining two Cavalry
units may move to a second Intercept space if needed there, otherwise stay
put.
IF NONE: If the above priorities result in no movement of
Troops and no Retaliate or Invite Feat can accompany the Intercept (per the priorities below), the Non-Player Dux will Battle
per 8.8.3 below (and attempt to remove co-located Raiders and
perhaps other enemies that way) instead of Intercepting.
RETALIATE: When the Non-player Dux is resolving an Intercept, it Retaliates if possible to remove a Stronghold belonging to
the Faction of Raiders that it will Battle. When several candidate
Retaliate spaces, select one randomly. If no Retaliate is possible
with this Intercept, Invite instead. NOTE: This situation of Raiders
in the same space as their own (non-Foederati) Stronghold occurs only rarely.
INVITE: Intercepting Dux that does not Retaliate might add
Invite as its Feat (if not Fragmentation, 4.2.2, 6.8) before executing
its Command.
•	 First determine which Barbarian Nation’s Foederati the Dux
might Invite by rolling a six-sided die—if the roll is a 1-3, the
Dux will only Invite Scotti on this Feat; if 4 6, only Saxons.
•	 Place Foederati of that Nation at a vacant Site (where already a
Dux piece and Friendly Control, 4.2.2) and only if there is no
red Foederati Settlement of that Nation already on the map.
NOTE: Non-player Dux do not replace Forts with Settlements when
Inviting Foederati. Rarely, it may place just a Settlement if no Warbands
of the chosen Nation are Available.
•	 If the Dux cannot place any new Foederati of the chosen
Nation, and if the Civitates Faction is a player (rather than a
Non-player), the Dux instead pays to convert the most blue
Foederati to red (of either Nation) that it can.
If the Dux checks for but does not Invite as its Feat (because
there is not suitable vacant Site, there are already too many of
the rolled Nation’s Feoderati Settlements out, or Imperium is at
Fragmentation, 4.2.2), it adds no Feat.
8.8.2 Priority Event? If Dux did not Intercept, it checks for a
high-priority Event:
If the current card’s red Dux symbol has a gray shield
•	
(8.2.1)—and if the Dux has the option to play the
Event by the Sequence of Play (2.3.4)—it does so.
See 8.1-8.4 for guidance (such as Briton use of unshaded text)
and check for Event Instructions (those few Dux shield Events
also bearing a sword have them).
•	 If the current Event is not a Dux “shield” Event, or if it is but
the Dux may not by Sequence play it now, check whether the
next card showing has the red Dux symbol with a gray shield
(with or without a sword over the shield) as either the 1st or
2nd Faction symbol (not 3rd or 4th). If so, Dux Passes.

8.8.3 Battle? If Dux neither Intercepted nor played or Passed
for a priority Event, it checks for Battle (if not already Battling
because it was to Intercept but neither moved nor added a Feat
to that Command, 8.8.1). If a Dux Battle Command now (per the
priorities below) would be sure in the absence of any successful
enemy Evasion or Ambush to add Prestige (3.6.5, perhaps also
via Retaliate, 4.2.4), the Dux Battle now among spaces where Dux
forces and potential enemies, as follows:
•	 First, if Civitates are a player and either their Wealth exceeds
Dux Prestige by at least 5 or they exceed their victory threshold
(disregarding Dominance, 7.2, 8.0), Dux forces now attack the
Civitates in each space where (blue) Briton Control and no
Dux Stronghold (regardless of Imperium or what situations
triggered the Dux Battle condition above). NOTE: The Nonplayer Dux with the Civitates threatening victory may effect a Briton civil
war in an attempt to reduce Briton Control.
•	 Then Dux forces attack enemy Factions (Barbarians and/
or, during Fragmentation, Civitates) wherever they have the
possibility of gaining Prestige or take Plunder, including to add
to Prosperity (and taking other Non-player tactics into account,
8.4.2). They first select spaces and enemies to attack Factions
doing the best against their victory threshold (7.2) that they
face and meet that requirement. NOTE: Like other Non-players,
Dux forces Ambush (if Foederati), Assault, and/or Siege per the Battle
Tactics table (8.4.2). EXAMPLE: If attacking Dux forces are able
to Assault to remove the enemy Faction’s Stronghold and/or can Siege
to remove an enemy’s unit, they do so. Cavalry participating in Assault
would take the first Escalade loss (3.6.4).
RETALIATE: As Non-player Dux Battles, it Retaliates whenever
possible to remove an enemy’s Stronghold.
•	 If there are several candidate Retaliate spaces, the Dux
Retaliates against the Battle enemy doing best against victory
threshold (within that, randomly among several spaces with
the same enemy Faction).
If not so able to Retaliate, Dux Requisitions instead.
REQUISITION: If Battling without Retaliation, or Training
or Marching without Inviting or Building (8.8.4-.5), the Dux
afterwards adds Requisition as its Feat.
•	 Non-player Dux Requisitions as many blue Resources to red
as it is able (4.2.3).
If not able to Requisition any red Resources, Non-player Dux
adds no Feat to that Command.
8.8.4 Train? If Dux checked for but declined or had no opportunity for Battle, it Trains if that would place two or more Cavalry
pieces onto the map.
As during Intercept (8.8.1), first check whether the Dux will add
an Invite Feat; use the same priorities as during Intercept above
(8.8.1, including rolling a die to choose either Scotti or Saxon
Foederati). If able, Invite now, before Training. If not, either
Build or Requisition, but not until after Training (see below).
Having resolved any Invite added to Train, Dux then:
•	 Places as much Cavalry as possible (selecting candidate Train
spaces randomly).

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play
If and only if current Imperium status is other than Fragmentation, Dux Trains as follows—
•	 Add Militia pieces as able, but only where Dux already is placing
Cavalry.
•	 Pay (unless free) to add Prosperity in up to two Regions where
able to add at least two Prosperity cubes per space, first where
able to add the most cubes (if tied, choosing randomly).
INVITE: Non-player Dux that Trains or Marches first checks to
see if it will add an Invite Feat before resolving the Command.
It does so as described in the INVITE section of 8.8.1 above,
except that, if it does not Invite, it then checks (below) whether
it will instead Build or Requisition.
BUILD: Dux that Trains or Marches without Inviting might Build
afterward in up to two spaces.
•	 If Imperium is not at Fragmentation, it places a Fort in each
Build space, selecting first a space that would contribute to
Raider subtraction via Patrolled Sea or against Caledonia Raids
(3.4.1, 3.5.1), if any. Once no Fort is Available, Dux then places
Towns, first by replacing Hillforts (4.2.1).
•	 If Imperium is at Fragmentation, Dux places Forts only, never
Towns, first so as to add Dux Control (if possible) rather than
with any regard to Raider subtraction.
If not so able to Build, Dux Requisitions instead.
REQUISITION: If Non-player Dux neither Invites nor Builds
with its Train or March Command, it instead follows the Command with Requisition as its Feat per 8.8.3 above (adding no Feat
if such Requisition is impossible).
8.8.5 Event? If Dux checked for Training but would
not place at least two Cavalry, it might play the current
(non-shield) Event. Roll a six-sided die. If the roll is 1-4,
and if Dux may opt for an Event per the Sequence of
Play (2.3), and if the current Event would be Effective (8.1.1)
and does not bear a gray raven behind the red Dux symbol, the
Dux executes the Event now (per 8.1-8.4, unshaded text).
•	
If the Dux symbol on the card bears a gray sword, check
the Non-Player Event Instructions for that Event
(8.2.1).
8.8.6 March? If the Dux for any of the above reasons (including
a die roll of 5 or 6) does not play the Event, it Marches.
As during Intercept or Train (8.8.1, -.4), first check whether the
Dux will add an Invite Feat now, before Marching. If not possible,
either Build or Requisition afterward, as for a Train Command
above (8.8.4).
Once having resolved pre-March Invite (if any), the Dux Marches
as follows. Roll a four-sided die. The result is the maximum
number of destination spaces that the Dux will move to, and also
is the maximum number of origin spaces from which Dux (and
possibly Civitates) forces will move.

33

Select to up to that 1D4 roll in destination Regions (not Cities)
which Dux forces could reach by March:
•	 If a Civitates player’s Wealth currently exceeds Dux Prestige,
or if a Civitates player exceeds victory threshold (disregarding
Dominance), first select Regions (not Cities) that have Briton
Control but no Dux Stronghold (Fort or red Foederati
Settlement) in them.
•	 Then, if the full number of destinations (1 to 4) has not yet
been selected, choose just a single Region with an enemy
Stronghold, first to the Settlement of a Barbarian with more
than 20 Renown (if any).
•	 Then, if the full number of destinations still has not been
found, select Regions with any (non-Foederati) Barbarians in
them (Raiders, Warbands or Strongholds), first Regions that
have no Friendly (Briton or, if Fragmentation, Dux) Control,
thereafter randomly among equal candidates.
NOTE: Non-player Dux does not March to Cities.
Having selected potential destinations, select origin spaces up to
the same 1D4-roll number:
•	 Select spaces from which the most total Troops (Dux, red
Foederati Warbands, and perhaps Civitates forces) can reach
the highest priority destination where more such Troops are
still needed to enable a Dux attack (in a hypothetical Battle
Command) to remove all of one enemy present there. If
the destination was selected via the first bullet above (or if
Fragmentation), treat Civitates forces as enemy. Select origin
spaces destination by destination, in above destination priority
order, moving on to consider the next destination only once
enough Dux forces would be able to reach the previous
destination to remove all of an enemy.
•	 Never split any origin space’s moving forces among more
than one destination. When considering the above priorities
and requirements in selecting origins, and then when moving
forces, all forces that move from a single origin move only to
a single destination. NOTE: Forces from multiple origins may arrive
at a single, common destination, but not the other way around.
From each origin space, move with all forces allowed (by the
priorities below and, as applicable, Civitates agreement to move
their forces). Leave behind one Friendly Troop cube per Friendly
Stronghold (counting Civitates as Friendly unless Fragmentation).
If Imperium is at Fragmentation, keep any Dux Control and the
origin and avoid adding any enemy Control to an Uncontrolled
origin.
NOTE: If not Fragmentation, Dux will depart from Regions without regard
to loss of Briton Control.
•	 Take Civitates forces along with moving Dux (with Civitates
agreement, and not at Fragmentation, 3.2.2), including via
pickup, only if the destination was chosen above in order to
reach a Barbarian target (not in order to reach Briton Control).
•	 Within all the above Dux March priorities and restrictions,
choose origin spaces and units to move so as to move Cavalry
first, then Foederati (red or, as applicable, blue and of either
Nation at random), then Comitates, finally Militia.

Pendragon ~ Rules of Play

PASS: If Dux is unable to so March (for example, due to lack of
Resources), the Dux Pass instead.
INVITE, BUILD, OR REQUISITION: If Dux did not Invite
before Marching, it checks afterward (in the following order) for
adding either Build, Requisition, or no Feat, per the same priorities
as for a Train Command, above (8.8.4).
8.8.7 Epoch Round. The Non-player Dux Faction makes decisions during the Epoch Round as follows:
•	 Pays Annona for its (red) Foederati in the highest number of
spaces that it can afford (6.1), choosing any unpaid spaces at
random (8.3.3).
•	 Pays Upkeep for all its Forts, then pays for Road Maintenance
(if at Autonomy and Roads remain Maintained, 6.6.1).
•	 Relocates its Troops (6.6.1) evenly by type (Cavalry and red
Foederati). EXAMPLE: Relocate 19 Cavalry among ten Forts by
moving them only as needed to end with two Cavalry at each of nine Forts,
one Cavalry at the tenth (chosen randomly).
8.8.8 Cooperation. The Non-player Dux Faction:
•	 Pays with blue rather than red Resources whenever it can (1.5.2).
•	 Never gives Tribute to Barbarians (1.5.2).
•	 Allows Civitates to move Dux pieces (3.3.2, 4.3.3) only if the
Civitates are a Non-player, never with a Civitates player.
NOTE: Per the Battle Tactics table (8.4.2), Non-player Dux, unless at
Fragmentation, admits Civitates forces that seek to Withdraw into Dux
Strongholds (3.6.3) and always agrees to absorb the first loss in any Assault
Escalade with a Cavalry present (3.6.4), even for a Civitates player.
8.8.9 Barbarian Deep Raid and Saxon Ravage. Whenever
Non-player Dux forces are present and have Friendly Control for
a Barbarian Surprise Deep Raid (4.4.2, 4.5.2) or are present where
a Saxon Ravage Feat (4.4.3), the Dux forces a Battle by attacking
the Raiding or Ravaging units if and only if there is no possibility
in that Battle of a Cavalry unit being removed (including consideration of removal order, 8.4.1, and Battle tactics, 3.6, 8.4.2).

8.9 1-Player Roles and Victory
A solitaire player can run any one Faction against three Non-players, or can run either both Britons or both Barbarians (using
their worse victory margin, 1.5) against two Non-player enemies.
ENTROPY: A solitaire player running both Briton Factions gives
up one of them to become a Non-player for the rest of the game
(including for victory) immediately upon Fragmentation (6.8). A
solitaire player running both Barbarians does so upon complete
execution of the second Barbarian Pivotal Event (play of both
Conspiratio Barbarica and Adventus Saxonum, 5.7).
•	 The player Faction doing better against its victory threshold at
that moment (7.2, including Fragmentation conditions, 6.8.7,
if applicable) becomes a Non-player. If tied, the player may
choose which single Faction of the two to continue to play.
1-Player Introductory Option: For the least challenge, allow
Non-players when granted a Limited Command by Sequence
of Play (2.3.4) to carry out a Command in just one space and
no Feat (ignoring the Non-player exception allowing a full
multi-space Command and Feat, 8.1.2).
1-Player Easy Option: For reduced challenge from the standard rules above, allow Non-players when granted a Limited
Command by Sequence of Play (2.3.4) to carry out a Command
in just one space plus a Feat (instead of the usual Non-player
full multi-space Command and Feat, 8.1.2).
1-Player Difficult Option: For the greatest challenge, prohibit
any solitaire player win before final Epoch. To succeed, the
player must both avoid any Non-player exceeding its victory
threshold during any Victory Phase (which would end the
game then, 7.1.-7.3) and end the final Epoch Round with the
highest victory margin.
NOTE: At game end, consult the Victory Outcomes table in the Playbook
on page 27 for a historical synopsis of the resulting fate of Roman Britain.

SETUP (2.1)
General

Deck Preparation

Choose a scenario and—if fewer than 4 players—any Non-player
options desired (1.5.1, 8.0, 8.9). Prepare the deck per the instructions at right and per the scenario. Assign players their Factions
(1.5, or see 8.0 Non-player option):

Separate out the seven Epoch and four Pivotal Event cards (5.6,
5.7). Remove, give to Factions, or place into play cards as specified
by the scenario. Shuffle remaining Event cards and randomly deal
them into the number of facedown piles of 12 cards specified
for the scenario. Shuffle either an Early or Late Epoch card, as
specified, among the bottom four cards of each 12 card piles.
Stack the 1st pile onto the 2nd onto the 3rd, and so on, to form
a single facedown draw deck in easy view of all players. Set aside
any remaining Event and Epoch cards—they will not be used
and may not be inspected.

2-player—Dux and Civitates versus Saxons and Scotti.
3-player—Dux versus Civitates versus Saxons and Scotti together,
or—if preferred—Dux and Civitates together versus Saxons
versus Scotti.
4-player—A Faction each player.
Give each player a Faction foldout and keep remaining aid sheets
at hand. Put the wooden Forces pieces into their Available Forces
boxes and all markers and gold cubes in piles or receptacles within
easy reach. Place a cylinder for each Faction in the Eligible box
(2.3).

Game Board
Set up forces, Prosperity cubes (bottom row first, 1.7.1), and
markers on the board as listed. NOTE: Colors highlight the setup of
Prosperity cubes and forces pieces.

SCENARIOS (2.1)
Final Victory Phase Margin: The
higher of Saxon Renown – 39 + 5 per
Saxon Settlement on the map (only if no
Fragmentation) or Saxon Control – 3 (at
any Imperium).

Scotti:

Barbarian Conspiracy
The late 4th to early 5th Centuries:
Hungry German, Pictish, and Irish
raiders flock to the weak but still well-off
Romanized Celts, setting the stage for the
fall of Britannia.

Duration

Short—up to two Epochs.

Victory

In this scenario, the final Victory Phase
does not add a Recovery Phase (6.2, 6.6).
Also, the Barbarians use the following
victory conditions and thresholds instead
of the usual (7.2, 7.3):

Saxons:
Automatic Victory Threshold: Either
Population under Saxon Control exceeds
3, or Saxon Renown exceeds 24 and
at least 3 Saxon Settlements (including
Foederati) are on the map.

Automatic Victory Threshold: Scotti
Renown exceeds 24 and at least 2 Scotti
Settlements (including Foederati) are on
map.
Final Victory Phase Margin: Scotti
Renown – 34 +5 per Scotti Settlement on
the map (or on Dal Riada Event card).

The Harder They Fall
The mid-5th Century AD: The Empire
through strenuous effort has faced down
the Barbarian Conspiracy, while British
imperial commanders have even joined
in power struggles on the continent. Can
Rome’s rule last generations more?

Duration

Medium—up to four Epochs.

Deck

Put a Capability marker on Pivotal
Conspiratio Barbarica – it has been
resolved and is in effect. Give the other
three Pivotal Events to their Factions.
Set aside the Early Epoch cards Magnus
Maximus and Constantine III.
Optional: For better play balance and
historicity, remove the following Event
cards from play:
#4 Stilicho
#13 Cunedda
#20 Thames
Shuffle all remaining Event cards and
deal 48 of them into four piles. Randomly
shuffle one of the two remaining Early
Epoch cards into the first 4-card pile.
Then shuffle the three Late Epoch cards,
one each, among the bottom four cards
of each pile. Stack the four piles, with
the Early Epoch pile on top. Set all other
cards aside.

De Excidio Britanniae
The late 4th through 5th Centuries:
Britannia—at the extremity of Empire
and beset from north, south, east, and
west—is now to suffer transformation
from well-administered diocese to warring
Dark-Age kingdoms.

Distribute all four Pivotal Events to their
Factions. Shuffle and deal the 72 Event
cards into six piles of 12 each. Randomly
shuffle an Early Epoch card among the
bottom four cards of the first three piles
and a Late Epoch card among the bottom
four of the last three piles. Stack the piles,
first three on top. Set the leftover Epoch
card aside.

						               													<description>From GMT's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Volume VIII in GMT&amp;rsquo;s COIN Series transports us into the 4th and 5th Centuries A.D. and to the embattled Isle of Britannia.  Pendragon &amp;ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.&amp;#10;Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.&amp;#10;Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&amp;mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.&amp;#10;Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.&amp;#10;Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.&amp;#10;Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.&amp;#10;Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.&amp;#10;Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.&amp;#10;Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.&amp;#10;Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.&amp;#10;A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.&amp;#10;Short, medium, and full-length scenarios&amp;#10;Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&amp;mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&amp;mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&amp;mdash;materially or culturally&amp;mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&amp;rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&amp;mdash;whoever their paymaster&amp;mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&amp;hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority. But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components: See Wiki below.&amp;#10;Players: 1-4 (includes full solitaire system)&amp;#10;Map: Area Movement&amp;#10;Timescale: about 15 years per campaign between Epoch cards&amp;#10;Designer: Marc Gouyon-Rety&amp;#10;Developer and Series Creator: Volko Ruhnke&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
