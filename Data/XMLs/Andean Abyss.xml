1.0 INTRODUCTION

Andean Abyss is a 1-4-player game depicting insurgent and
counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict in Colombia during the 1990s
and early 2000s. Each player takes the role of a Faction seeking to run Colombian affairs: the Government (Govt) or 1 of 3
Insurgent Factions—the Marxist FARC, the right-wing AUC
“paramilitaries”, or the narco-trafficking Cartels. Using military,
political, and economic actions and exploiting various events,
players build and maneuver forces to influence the population,
extract resources, or otherwise achieve their Faction’s aims. A
deck of cards regulates turn order, events, victory checks, and
other processes. The rules can run non-player Factions, enabling
solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.

penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next
card. Propaganda cards mixed in with the Event cards provide
periodic opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as
collecting resources and influencing popular sympathies.

1.2 Components

A complete set of Andean Abyss includes:

This rule book lists and defines key game terms in an index on
pages 19-20. The most important game functions are summarized
on several aid sheets. Game setup is explained on the flip side of
the Sequence of Play aid sheet.

•	 A 22”x34” mounted game board.
•	 A deck of 76 cards.
•	 153 dark and light blue, red, green, and yellow wooden forces
pieces, some embossed (1.4; see “Available Forces” on the rule
book’s back for a complete listing).
•	 8 cylinders, embossed (1.7, 2.2).
•	 6 black and 6 white pawns (3.1.1).
•	 A sheet of markers.
•	 2 Sequence of Play and Setup sheets.
•	 4 Faction player aid foldouts.
•	 1 Non-player Insurgents flowcharts foldout.
•	 1 Non-player aid foldout with Government flowchart.
•	 3 6-sided dice: 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green.
•	 A background Playbook.
•	 This rule book.

1.1 General Course of Play

1.3 The Map

Andean Abyss is the inaugural volume in the COIN Series of
games that use similar rules to cover a variety of insurgencies and
other inter-factional conflicts. This Second Edition extensively
alters and augments rules and play aids throughout to bring this
volume up to date within the Series. Updated cards are marked
“2nd Ed”.

Andean Abyss—unlike most card-assisted war games—does not
use hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one at
time, with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event card
shows the order in which the Factions become Eligible to choose
between the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations and
Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries the

The map shows the country of Colombia divided into various
types of spaces, as well as parts of neighboring countries.

1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Departments
(Depts), urban Cities, and Lines of Communication (LoCs)
between them. All spaces—including LoCs—can hold forces.

1.3.2 Departments. Each Department shows a Population value
(Pop) of 0, 1, or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to the Government (1.6) and some Insurgent Operations
(3.3). Departments are further distinguished by terrain as Tropical
Forest (Forest), Mountain, or Grassland, affecting some COIN
Operations (3.2) and Events (5.0).
1.3.3 Cities. Each City similarly shows a Population value of 1
to 8 (each Population value representing a million Colombians).
1.3.4 LoCs. Each Line of Communication (LoC) shows an Economic value (Econ) of 1 to 3 that affects Government Resources
(1.7). LoCs are further distinguished as Roads or Pipelines.
Pipelines tend to have higher Economic value and affect certain
Events.
DESIGN NOTE: LoCs also represent other transportation arteries and infrastructure such as power lines that parallel roads
and pipelines.

ADJACENCY EXAMPLE: The 4 Departments and 4 LoCs around
the Town of Ayacucho are all adjacent to each other because they
are separated by a Town. Antioquia and the Forest Department
to the west are adjacent because they are separated by a LoC.

1.3.5 Foreign Countries. The map includes parts of Brazil (Brasil), Ecuador, Panamá, Perú, and Venezuela. They are not spaces
(1.3.1) unless and until specified by Event (5.0).

•	 Spaces that border on (touch) one another.
•	 Departments separated by LoCs.
•	 LoCs or Departments separated by Towns.

EXAMPLE: The “Darién” Event renders Panamá a 0 Population
Forest Department for all purposes, except that Sweep Operations do not Activate Guerrillas there (3.2.3).

NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely separate LoCs or
Departments.

NOTE: Venezuela is next to Guainía but not Vaupés, affecting
the “Hugo Chávez” Event.
1.3.6 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any 2 spaces meeting one of
the following conditions are adjacent:

1.3.7 Coasts. Spaces adjacent to blue areas are coastal, affecting
the “Narco-Subs” Event.

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: Government Troops (dark-blue cubes) and Police (light-blue cubes),
Insurgent Guerrillas, and all Factions’ Bases.

Andean Abyss

DESIGN NOTE: Bases represent not only training and bivouac
facilities but also, for the Insurgents, political administration as
well as coca or poppy fields and processing labs.
PLAY NOTE: Use “Overflow” boxes for Forces that exceed the
room in a City or smaller Department on the map; place the
corresponding Overflow marker in that space.
1.4.1 Availability and Removal. The inventory shown on the
“Available Forces” chart on the back of this rule book limits the
number of pieces that may be in play. Keep forces not on the
map in the Available Forces holding areas. (Place Bases in the
highest-numbered empty circles, revealing the number of on-map
Bases to help track victory, 7.0)
•	 Forces may only be placed from or replaced with those available in the holding areas—ignore any instructions to place
forces if the appropriate type is not available because all are
already on the map (remove rather than replace such pieces;
see also next bullet).
•	 Important: A player Faction while executing an Operation or
Event by the Sequence of Play (2.3.4, 3.0, 5.0), may remove
its own pieces to Available Forces. EXAMPLE: Insurgents
without Available Guerrillas could remove Guerrillas during
a Rally (3.3.1) in order to place them Underground.
•	 Once an enemy Faction is targeted, removal or Activation
of pieces to the extent of the executing Faction’s ability is
required. EXAMPLE: A Government Assault (3.2.4) with 3
Troops in Forest must remove 3 Active pieces if there are at
least that many among those Factions targeted.

1.4.2 Stacking. No more than 2 Bases (regardless of Faction)
may occupy a single Department or City. Bases may not occupy
LoCs. Government forces may not occupy a FARC Zone (6.4.4).
(See also the “Sucumbíos” Event regarding Ecuador.) Ignore any
instructions (such as from Operations or Events) to place or move
forces if stacking would be violated. Except as noted above, any
number of Government cubes and Guerrillas may occupy a space.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas are either
Underground—symbol end down—or Active-symbol end up. Certain actions and Events
flip them from one to the other state. Bases, Troops, and Police
are always Active. Always set up and place new Guerrillas Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla,
it is sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay
Active).

1.5 Players & Factions

•	 With 3 players, AUC runs the Cartels.
•	 With 2 players, Government runs AUC; FARC runs the Cartels.
A player running two Factions uses the lower victory margin of
the two (7.1-.3) and only causes play to end on a victory check
(6.1) if both Factions are meeting their conditions. Players may
not voluntarily transfer (1.5.2) between their own Factions.
Non-Player Option: If playing solitaire, or as an alternative
to the above with two or three players, use the Non-player
rules in section 8 to govern leftover Factions:
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules but may voluntarily transfer only Resources (1.7)
or Shipments (4.5.3) and only during either’s execution by the
Sequence of Play (2.3.4) of an Operation or Event. All negotiations are open. The rules do not bind players to agreements.

1.6 Support and Opposition

Support and Opposition affect victory and some Operations.
1.6.1 Cities and Departments with at least 1 Population (1.3.2-3)
always show 1 of 5 levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition to the Government that can shift during play:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Active Support.
Passive Support.
Neutral.
Passive Opposition.
Active Opposition.

1.6.2 Show Active or Passive Support or Opposition with markers placed in each City or Department. Show Neutral spaces by
the absence of such markers. Active Support/Opposition counts
double for Total Support/Opposition (1.6.3).

NOTE: LoCs (1.3.4) and Population 0 Departments never hold
Support or Opposition markers (they are always Neutral).
1.6.3 Total Support and Total Opposition. Government or FARC victory depends on the total value of population
Support or Opposition (plus FARC Bases,
7.2), respectively. Adjust “Total Support” or “Opposition + Bases” on the numbered edge track per the box
below as any change to Support, Opposition, or the
number of FARC Bases occurs.

Andean Abyss is playable by 1-4 players. The 1st player plays
the Government (blue), the 2nd the FARC (red), the 3rd the AUC
(yellow), and the 4th the Cartels (green) (2.1). (If preferred, the
3rd player in a 3-player game can play Cartels instead of AUC.)
Each of these Factions is enemy to all others. Leftover Factions
are Non-Player; their actions are governed by rules section 8.
See the Playbook for a Role Summary of each Faction.

Total Support and Opposition Equations

1.5.1 Spare Factions. With two or three players, the players run
leftover Factions:

Opposition + Bases equals:
Total Opposition + The number of FARC Bases on the map

Total Support equals:
(2 x Population in Active Support) + (1 x Population in Passive
Support)
Total Opposition equals:
(2 x Population in Active Opposition) + (1 x Population in
Passive Opposition)

1.7 Resources and Aid

At any moment, each Faction has between 0 and 99
Resources that it uses to pay for Operations (3.0).
During some Propaganda Rounds (6.3.1) and
Events, a level of Aid (between 0 and 29) adds to
Government Resources. Mark Resources and Aid on the edge
track—for Resources, with a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5).

2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost
symbol in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st
Eligible to execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next
leftmost is the 2nd Eligible.

Faction
Order

1.8 Control

The Government Controls a City or
Department if its pieces alone exceed
those of all other Factions combined. In
the same way, FARC Controls a City or
Department if its pieces alone exceed those of all other Factions
combined. Cities or Departments that are not Controlled by either
the Government or FARC are Uncontrolled. As helpful, place
appropriate Control markers on spaces as reminders.
PLAY NOTE: Control mainly affects Propaganda Round (6.2-6.5)
and some Non-player Government actions (section 8).
DESIGN NOTE: “FARC Control” of a City might not represent
complete military control of a major urban area but rather sufficient presence to inhibit commerce and encourage resistance
to government authority.

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions onthe flip side of the Sequence of Play
aid sheet to decide upon various play options, assign Factions to
players, prepare the deck, and set up markers and forces.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of
the draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played first;
the card on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE:
Players will see 1 card ahead into the deck. All played cards
and the number of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are
completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the
Sequence of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Propaganda
Rounds [6.0], advance the Prop Card marker).

2.3 Event Card

When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event; other Factions may Pass and collect Resources.

•	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of the Faction symbols shown
at the top of the card.
•	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or
Event on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start
the card in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.7). Factions that did are
Ineligible. (All Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free
Operations, 3.1.2.

5

NOTE: The gray 2 symbol and “2nd: Ops” on some cards affect
Non-player choices (8.1)—ignore them unless using Non-players.
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction opts to Pass, it
receives +1 Resources (or +3 Resources if Government) and
remains Eligible for the next card. The next leftmost Eligible
Faction then replaces the Passing Faction as the new 1st or 2nd
Eligible Faction and receives the same options to execute or Pass.
If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction Passes, adjust cylinders
(2.3.7) and play the next card.
2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.

FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass
(2.3.3), it may execute either:

•	 An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—or
•	 The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction
does not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation and possibly the Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible
Faction executed:

•	 Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
•	 Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction
may execute either a Limited Operation or the Event. (see also
Final Event Card, 2.3.9).
•	 Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd
Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special
Activity if desired.
NOTE: For ease of reference, these options are illustrated on the
Sequence of Play aid sheet and on the game board.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation (LimOp) is a
player Operation in just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the
Limited Operation is a Patrol (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March
(3.3.2), it can involve pieces from multiple spaces but only 1 destination space. A Limited Operation counts as an Operation. See
also Final Event Card (2.3.9) and Non-player Operations (8.1).
2.3.6 Ship. Whenever a 1st or 2nd Eligible player Faction pays
Resources to execute an Operation (including a Limited Operation, 2.3.5) but executes no Special Activity, it may remove a
Shipment that it owns (4.5.3) to immediately execute an additional, free, Limited Operation of any type. Alternatively, a different
Faction may remove its own Shipment to enable the 1st or 2nd
Eligible Faction to execute such a free Operation. A Faction may
only benefit from 1 such Shipment per card.

EXAMPLE: Cartels is 1st Eligible and executes a March, removes
a Shipment, then executes a Rally in 1 space at no Resource cost.
DESIGN NOTE: The added Op reflects proceeds from a major
drug deal greasing the skids.
2.3.7 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and
Events (or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust
cylinders on the Sequence of Play Track as follows:

•	 Move the cylinder to the “Eligible” box if the Faction did not
execute an Operation or Event (and not rendered Ineligible by
an Event).
•	 Move the cylinder to the “Ineligible” box if the Faction
executed an Operation (including a Limited Operation) or
Event (unless otherwise specified by the Event; see also Free
Operations, 3.1.2.).

2.3.8 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw
deck’s top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the
draw deck’s next card. Play the card on the played card pile,
proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
2.3.9 Final Event Card. On the last Event card before the final
Propaganda Card (2.4.1), any player Operations must be Limited
(2.3.5, no Special Activities) and may not include Sweep (3.2.3)
or March (3.3.2).

2.4 Propaganda Card

If playing a Propaganda Card, conduct a Propaganda Round (6.0).
2.4.1 Final Propaganda. If the 4th Propaganda card’s Round
is completed without a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine
victory by 7.3.
Short Game Option: Agree at set up that the 3rd Propaganda
card’s Round will be the final round.

NOTE: Players pay for Operations space by space as they go,
enabling Insurgents at 0 Resources to Extort, Kidnap, or Process
to add Resources and then pay for additional Operations spaces.
(See 4.1 and its EXAMPLE).
3.1.1 Pawns. Players may mark spaces selected for Operations
(3.0) with white pawns and Special Activities (4.0) with black
pawns. (The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on the number
of spaces that may be selected.)
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5), phases (6.4.5), or
Shipping drugs (2.3.6) grant free Operations or Special Activities:
they cost no Resources and, if executed by a Faction other than
the one playing an Event, could leave it Eligible (2.3.7). Other
requirements and procedures still apply unless trumped by Event
text (5.1.1, 5.5.).

3.2 COIN Operations

The Government chooses from Train, Patrol, Sweep, and
Assault Operations. Note: The Government may never place or
move its pieces into FARC Zones; see 6.4.4.
3.2.1 Train. Training Operations augment Government forces
and possibly build Support (1.6). Select any Departments or
Cities and pay 3 Resources per selected space.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected Department with a Government Base AND in each selected City, place up to 6 cubes
(any combination of Available Troops and Police). Then, in up
to 1 selected space, either:

•	 Replace any 3 cubes with 1 Government Base (within
stacking,1.4.2), OR
•	 Conduct Civic Action (6.4.1) to build Support. As during the
Support Phase, the Government must have Troops, Police, and
Control (a majority of forces, 1.8) in the space and must pay
added Resources per 6.4.1 (even if Training was free).

PLAY NOTE: Set aside Propaganda cards to show how many
have gone by. Each series of Event cards up to a Propaganda
Round is called a “Campaign”.

3.2.2 Patrol. Patrol Operations protect LoCs by moving Troops
or Police onto them and finding and removing Guerrillas there.
Pay 3 Resources total (not per space). If a Limited Operation
(2.3.5), all moving cubes must end on a single destination space.

3.0 OPERATIONS

PROCEDURE: Move any number of cubes from any spaces.
Each cube may move into any adjacent LoC or City (1.3.6)
and may keep entering adjacent LoCs or Cities until the player
chooses to stop moving it or it enters a space containing 1 or more
Guerrillas. Then, in each LoC (even if a LimOp, and whether or
not a cube just moved there), Activate 1 Guerrilla for each cube
there. Then, if desired, conduct an Assault (3.2.4) in 1 LoC at
no added cost. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the Assault must
be in the destination LoC.

3.1 Operations in General

The Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction aid sheet and, if applicable, selects
the map spaces to be involved. The Faction usually pays a cost
in Resources (not Aid, 1.7), often per space selected; it must
have enough Resources to pay for the Operation, including in
each selected space. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation.
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which
the Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions or pieces to be
affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed or replaced. A single Operation may target one or more Factions and
ignore others. Once targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to
the maximum extent possible (1.4.1).

3.2.3 Sweep. Sweep Operations move Troops (typically, into
contested areas) and locate enemy Guerrillas. Select any Cities
or Departments as destinations (not FARC Zones, 6.4.4). Pay 3
Resources per space selected. Sweep is not allowed on the final
Event card (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: First, simultaneously move any adjacent Troops
desired into selected spaces. In addition, Troops may first move

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Andean Abyss
onto adjacent LoCs (1.3.6) that are free of Guerrillas and then
into adjacent spaces. (Any Troops that move must reach spaces
paid for as destinations.)

•	 Then, in selected spaces other than Forest, Activate 1 Guerrilla
(1.4.3) for each cube there (Police plus Troops, whether they
just moved or were already there).
•	 In Forest spaces, Activate only 1 Guerrilla for every 2 cubes
(round odd cubes down).
NOTE: Sweeps do not have to both move Troops and Activate
Guerrillas; they may move where no Guerrillas and may simply
Activate Guerrillas in place.

7

3.3 Insurgent Operations

Insurgent Factions (FARC, AUC, and Cartels) choose from Rally, March, Attack, and
Terror Operations.

Note that, on the Faction aid sheets under “Insurgent Operations”,
the terms “Guerrillas” and “Bases” mean those of the executing
Faction (friendly), unless otherwise specified.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment or recover friendly
forces. Select any Departments or Cities. Pay 1 Resource per
space selected.
•	 FARC may only select Neutral or Opposition spaces, not those
with Support (1.6).
•	 AUC may only select Neutral or Support spaces, not those
with Opposition.

PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction
places 1 of its Available Guerrillas or replaces 2 of its Guerrillas
with 1 of its Bases, within stacking (1.4.2). If the space already
has at least 1 of that Faction’s Bases, the Faction may instead
either:

EXAMPLE: The Government selects Cesar-La Guajira Department for a Sweep. There are no Guerrillas on any LoCs. Troops
could move from Cúcuta, Bucaramanga, and Sincelejo to the
LoCs south of Baranquilla and from there into Cesar. Troops
already in Baranquilla or any of the 3 Departments or 4 LoCs
adjacent to Cesar also could enter Cesar.
3.2.4 Assault. Assault Operations eliminate Insurgent forces.
Select any spaces and pay 3 Resources per space selected.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove 1 Active Guerrilla
(1.4.3) for each Troops cube there. Once a targeted Faction has
no Guerrillas in the space, remove its Bases instead.
•	 In a City or LoC, also remove 1 enemy piece for each Police
cube there.
•	 In Mountain, instead remove only 1 piece for every 2 Troops
(rounded down).

DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less militarily capable than
Government forces but enjoy an information advantage in that
Government Operations generally must first Sweep to Activate
(locate) them before Assaulting them.
NOTE: The Faction aid sheets use the phrase “Bases last” to
remind that an Operation cannot remove an enemy Base as long
as Guerrillas (Active or Underground), Troops, or Police of the
same Faction remain in the same space. Also, all of a Faction’s
Guerrillas in a space may be Underground, preventing further
removal via Assault of its pieces (including Bases) until the
Guerrillas are Activated.

•	 Place a number of its Available Guerrillas up to the number
of its Bases there plus the space’s Population value (1.3.2-.3)
OR
•	 Move any of its Guerrillas from any spaces on the map to
there and flip all its Guerrillas there Underground (whether
they moved or not) (1.4.3).
3.3.2 March. March Operations move friendly Guerrillas. Select any spaces as the origins of the moving Guerrillas. Pay 1
Resource per City or Department that Guerrillas move into (0
Resources to move onto LoCs). If a Limited Operation (2.3.5),
all moving Guerrillas must end in a single destination space.
Players may not March on the final Event card (2.3.9).

PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas desired into adjacent spaces (1.3.6). No Guerrilla moves more
than once. Guerrillas moving from 1 space to another move as a
single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving group to Active (1.4.3) if:
•	 The destination space is a LoC or is a City or Department with
Support (1.6)—or, for AUC March, Support or Opposition—
AND
•	 The moving group’s number of Guerrillas plus the number
of cubes in the destination space exceeds 3. For AUC March,
count FARC Guerrillas as cubes.

EXAMPLE: A group of 2 Underground FARC Guerrillas March
from Meta East to Santander-Boyacá, which has Passive Support and where there are 1 Police and 1 Troops cubes. Because
the destination is a Department with Support and the total of 4
cubes and moving Guerrillas involved exceeds 3, the 2 moving
Guerrillas flip to Active.
NOTE: March often Activates Guerrillas, but moves by Event
(5.0) do so only if specified.

3.2.5 Drug Bust. For each Shipment (4.5.3) removed by Assault,
add +6 to Aid (to a maximum of 29).

3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces; particularly successful attacks augment friendly Guerrillas
(by capturing enemy weapons, equipment, rations, recruits, or
drugs). Select any spaces where the executing Faction has at
least 1 Guerrilla and 1 enemy piece; pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the
executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less
than or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas
there (whether or not they began Active), remove up to 2 enemy
pieces (executing Faction’s choice; may include Underground
Guerrillas). The 2 pieces may belong to different Factions. A
targeted Faction’s Bases cannot be removed before all its cubes
or Guerrillas in the space.
CAPTURED GOODS: If the roll was a “1”, place 1 of the executing Faction’s Available Guerrillas (1.4.1) there. If a Shipment
(4.5.3) was removed, place it in the space with a Guerrilla of the
executing Faction.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Departments or Cities neutralize (or, for FARC,
build) Support or Opposition (1.6) and
place Terror markers that hinder future
efforts to influence it. On LoCs, they place Sabotage markers
that block Government Resource earnings (6.3.1). AUC Terror
harms Aid to the Government. Select any spaces where the executing Faction has at least 1 Underground Guerrilla; pay 1
Resource per City or Department (0 for LoCs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 friendly Underground Guerrilla in
each selected space.

•	 If the space is a Department or City, place a Terror marker and
shift any Support or Opposition 1 level toward Neutral (remove
Passive or shift Active to Passive and adjust Total Support or
Opposition, 1.6) OR, if FARC, toward Active Opposition.
•	 If the space is a LoC without a Sabotage marker, place a
Sabotage marker.
•	 Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on
the map. (There are 40.)
AID CUT: If AUC is executing the Terror (including via Event,
5.0), drop Aid by –3 if the Terror occurred in a single space or
by –5 if in 2 or more spaces, to a minimum of 0 (1.7). Note: Aid
at 0 does not stop AUC Terror.

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

EXAMPLE: FARC with 0 Resources Extorts or Kidnaps enough
to pay for the necessary accompanying Operations thereafter
(4.1.1).
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity,
the 2nd Eligible will have the option of executing the card’s
Event (2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities
specify that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0). Certain Special Activities may take place only in the
locations of their Accompanying Operations. If not otherwise
specified, Special Activities may accompany any Operations and
take place in any otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 Government Special Activities

The Government may choose from Air Lift, Air Strike,
or Eradicate Special Activities.
4.2.1 Air Lift. Air Lift moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move up to 3 Troops from 1 space to another
(not FARC Zone, 6.4.4).
4.2.2 Air Strike. An Air Strike destroys an exposed Insurgent
unit. It may only accompany a Patrol, Sweep, or Assault (3.2.2-.4)
and take place in a single Department or LoC (not City).
PROCEDURE: Remove 1 Active Guerrilla or, if the targeted
Faction has no Guerrillas in the space, 1 of its Bases.
4.2.3 Eradicate. Eradication destroys rural Cartels Bases and
earns Aid but at a cost of increasing local sympathy for FARC.
It may take place in any 1 Department with Cartels pieces (even
Cartels Guerrillas without Bases).
PROCEDURE: Boost Aid by +4, to a maximum of 29 (1.7).
Remove all Cartels Bases in the selected space (regardless of
Guerrillas there). Then:

•	 Shift that or an adjacent Department 1 level toward Active
Opposition (1.6.1), if possible.
•	 Or, if not possible (because all are already at Active Opposition
or have 0 Population), instead place 1 available FARC Guerrilla
in that Department.
DESIGN NOTE: Farmers of coca and other crops harmed tend
to resent Government spraying.

4.3 FARC Special Activities

4.1 Special Activities in General

When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes an Operation in at least 1 space (3.0), it may also execute
1 type of its Special Activities (Exception: Limited Operations,
2.3.5). Some Events grant free Special Activities (3.1.2).

•	 As with Operations, the executing Faction selects spaces,
Factions, or pieces affected and the order of actions. A Faction
may execute its Special Activity at any one time immediately
before, during, or immediately after the execution of its Operation.

FARC may choose from Ambush, Extort, or Kidnap
Special Activities.
4.3.1 Extort. Extortion enables FARC to gain Resources from
regions they dominate. FARC may simultaneously Extort in any
spaces (including LoCs) where FARC forces include at least 1
Underground Guerrilla and FARC has Control (its forces outnumber all enemies, 1.8).
PROCEDURE: For each selected space, Activate 1 Underground
FARC Guerrilla there (1.4.3) and add +1 to FARC Resources
(1.7).

4.3.2 Ambush. An Ambush enables FARC to ensure the complete
success of an Attack in 1 space. It must take place in a space
selected for Attack (3.3.3, not yet resolved) and that has at least
1 Underground FARC Guerrilla (1.4.3).

PROCEDURE: Relocate 1 Cartels Base from any space to the
selected space (within stacking, 1.4.2). Or, if the space is a Department selected for a Rally Operation (whether or not it just
received a Guerrilla), if desired instead place 1 Cartels Base there.

PROCEDURE: Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3),
the Attack in that space Activates 1 Underground Guerrilla only
and automatically succeeds (do not roll; remove the 2 enemy
pieces normally). Place an Available FARC Guerrilla in the space
(Underground, 1.4.3) as if a “1” had been rolled.

DESIGN NOTE: Cultivation represents the ability of drug syndicates quickly and clandestinely to arrange purchase from new
growers and move processing labs and delivery routes.

4.3.3 Kidnap. Kidnapping takes variable amounts of Resources
(1.7) from the Government or the Cartels or a Shipment (4.5.3)
from the Cartels, at a small risk of adding to AUC growth. It may
take place in up to 3 spaces that:

•	 Were or will be selected for Terror (3.3.4) this Operation, AND
•	 Are City, LoC, or have a Cartels Base, AND
•	 Have more FARC Guerrillas than Police.
PROCEDURE: Target either the Government if the space is a
City or LoC, or the Cartels if the space has 1 or 2 Cartels Bases.
Roll a die for each space and transfer to FARC from the targeted
Faction a number of Resources equal to the die roll. Whenever a
“6” is rolled, AUC places 1 Available piece in that space (within
stacking, 1.4.2). If a targeted Faction runs out of Resources, no
more is transferred.
DRUG RANSOM: If targeting the Cartels where they hold a
Shipment (4.5.3), instead of rolling, place the Shipment with a
FARC Guerrilla there.
DESIGN NOTE: This Special Activity represents the potentially
lucrative kidnapping of family members of drug lords, politicians,
and other wealthy. Routine kidnapping is represented in the game
within Terror and Extort.

4.4 AUC Special Activities

AUC may choose from Extort, Ambush, or Assassinate
Special Activities.

4.5.2 Process. Processing prepares major drug Shipments or
exchanges Bases for Resources. It may only accompany a Rally
or March Operation (3.3.1-.2) and may occur in any spaces with
at least 1 Cartels Base.
PROCEDURE: Remove any Cartels Bases desired and add +3
Cartels Resources for each Base removed. Alternatively, place a
total of 1 or 2 available Shipments (4.5.3) under any Guerrillas
in spaces with Cartels Bases.
4.5.3 Shipment Markers. The 4 Shipment markers
represent major processed drug caches awaiting
delivery and are a limit on play. On the map, they
are always placed beneath a Guerrilla and move
with it. That Guerrilla’s Faction owns the Shipment. A Guerrilla
may hold several Shipments. The owner may transfer the Shipment to another Guerrilla in the same space at any time (even as
the Guerrilla is removed or replaced and including to another
Faction’s Guerrilla). Shipments are only removed via Event (5.0)
or as follows:
•	 If a Guerrilla holding a Shipment is removed, the owner must
immed­iately transfer the Shipment to another Guerrilla if possible,
otherwise remove it.
•	 Players after executing Operations without Special Activities
may remove a Shipment they own for a free, extra Limited
Operation (2.3.6).
•	 During the Resource Phase, all Shipments are removed and
provide the owner either a Base or +6 Resources (6.3.3).

4.4.1 Extort & Ambush. AUC Extorts and Ambushes the same
as FARC (4.3.1-2) but using AUC instead of FARC forces.

4.5.4 Bribe. Bribes neutralize other Factions’ units or expose or
hide Guerrillas but cost Resources (1.7). They may occur in any
of up to 3 spaces, and may accompany any Cartels Operation.

4.4.2 Assassinate. Assassination efficiently eliminates enemy
units—even protected Bases. It may occur in any of up to 3
spaces selected for AUC Terror (3.3.4) this Operation in which
AUC Guerrillas outnumber Police.

PROCEDURE: For each space, reduce Cartels Resources –3 and
remove up to 2 cubes there, remove or flip up to 2 Guerrillas
there, or remove a Base there. NOTE: Bribe is the only Special
Activity with a Resource cost.

PROCEDURE: In each such space, remove any 1 enemy piece.

CONTRABAND: The Cartels player may transfer any Shipments
(4.5.3) removed by Bribe to any Guerrilla in the space.

COMMANDEER: If an Assassination forces the removal of a
Shipment (4.5.3) place it with an AUC Guerrilla in the space.

4.5 Cartels Special Activities

The Cartels may choose from Cultivate, Process, or Bribe
Special Activities.
4.5.1 Cultivate. Cultivation relocates trafficking activity or
propagates a new growing area. It may only accompany a Rally
or March Operation (3.3.1-.2). The destination is 1 Department
or City with Population greater than 0 and with more Cartels
Guerrillas than Police.

5.2 Dual Use

Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The
executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text
to carry out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the
Government, a player may select either text option regardless
of Faction.

Card Number
Faction Order

Title
Italicized Flavor Text
Event Text
Lasting Effects Indicator
Shaded Text
(see Dual Use 5.2)

5.0 EVENTS

DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of
the same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject
to alternative historical interpretation.

5.3 Govt Capabilities

Dual-use Events marked “GOVT CAPABILITIES” have lasting effects that either
help or hurt the Government. When executing such an Event, place the corresponding marker on the appropriate side in the Govt Capabilities box.
The Event’s effects last for the rest of the game.

5.4 Insurgent Momentum

Each Event bears a title, italicized flavor text, and Event text.
Flavor text provides historical interest and has no effect on play.
Cards with text updated for this edition are marked “2nd Ed”.

5.1 Executing Events

When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally (sometimes involving actions or decisions by other
Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction
makes all selections involved in implementing the text, such
as which pieces are affected. EXAMPLE: A Faction executing
an Event that forces another Faction to Attack could choose
the Attacking Faction; the Attacking Faction would make any
selections allowed within the Event’s required Attack (per 3.1).
Some Events with lasting effects have markers as aids to play.
(For Events that place FARC Zones, see 6.4.4.)
5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence. EXAMPLE: If the Event says any Guerrilla in a particular space executes Terror or Ambush, even an already Active
Guerrilla there can do so. However:

•	 Events never place pieces that are not available (1.4.1); they
remove rather than replace if the replacement is not available.
•	 Events may not violate stacking (1.4.2, including no
Government forces into FARC Zones, 6.4.4).
•	 Events may not raise Aid beyond 29 or a Faction’s Resources
beyond 99 (1.7).
•	 Events never allow a Faction to execute a type of Operation
or Special Activity available only to other Factions (3.0, 4.0).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence.
EXAMPLE: “Former Military” could result in Assault against
FARC even if FARC had just played “Senado & Cámara”.
5.1.3 If not all of an executed Event’s text can be carried out,
implement that which can.

Dual-use shaded Event text marked “INSURGENT MOMENTUM” has lasting effects that hurt the Government. When executing such shaded text, place the card in one of the Insurgent
Momentum holding boxes. The effects last until the next Propaganda round’s Reset phase (6.6), when the card is discarded.
Note: The 2 holding boxes are intended for convenience and
not a limit on the number of Insurgent Momentum Events that
can be in play.

5.5 Free Operations

Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual
sequence of play and typically is free: it bears no Resource cost
and does not affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other requirements remain unless trumped by Event text (5.1.1).
EXAMPLE: Free Terror must Activate an Underground Guerrilla
per 3.3.4, but Event text specifying Terror by “any Guerrilla”
could use an already Active Guerrilla.

6.0 PROPAGANDA ROUNDS

Conduct a Propaganda Round in the sequence of phases below
as each Propaganda Card is played. The Sequence of Play sheet
and board also list this sequence.
EXCEPTION: Never conduct more than 1 Propaganda Round
in a row (without at least 1 Event card in between)—instead,
additional Propaganda cards are played without a Propaganda
Round. If such an additional Propaganda card is final (2.4.1),
end the game and determine victory (7.3).

6.1 Victory Phase

If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends (exceptions: Non-player option [1.5]; 1-player [8.8]). See Victory
(7.0) to determine winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue
with the Propaganda Round. After completing the final Propaganda card’s Round (2.4.1), determine victory per 7.3.

ernment selects from among Departments with the most FARC
pieces that is not already a FARC Zone to receive a FARC Zone
marker.

6.2 Sabotage Phase

Sabotage (3.3.4) each unSabotaged LoC
where total Guerrillas exceed cubes or
for which an adjacent City is under
FARC Control.

6.3 Resources Phase

Add to Factions’ Resources per the following sequence, to a
maximum of 99 (1.7).
6.3.1 Government Earnings. Add the total Economic value
(1.3.4) of all LoCs that have no Sabotage markers (30 minus the
Econ of Sabotaged LoCs) plus Aid. Exception: If El Presidente
(6.4.3) is Samper, do not add Aid.
6.3.2 Insurgent Earnings. Add to:

•	 FARC and AUC: The number of its Bases.
•	 Cartels: Three times its Bases.
6.3.3 Drug Profits. FARC, then AUC, then Cartels remove
any Shipments (5.2.2) that they own, selecting to receive for
each either an available Base at the Shipment’s location (within
stacking, 1.4.2) or +6 Resources.

6.4 Support Phase

The Government then FARC may spend Resources to affect
popular Support and Opposition (1.6), then an Election is held.
6.4.1 Civic Action. Government may spend any number of
Resources to build Support in Govt-Controlled Cities or Departments (1.8) that have both Troops and Police. Every 3
Resources spent removes 1 Terror marker or—once no Terror
is in a space—shifts it 1 level toward Active Support. (Adjust
Total Support, 1.6.3.)
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police together provide the security
needed to make gains in popular support. See also Training, 3.2.1.
6.4.2 Agitation. FARC similarly may spend Resources to encourage Opposition in FARC-Controlled Cities or Departments (1.8).
Every 1 Resource spent removes 1 Terror marker or—once no
Terror is in a space—shifts it 1 level toward Active Opposition.
(Adjust Opposition+Bases, 1.6.3.) (1-player: see 8.7.5.)
6.4.3 Election. A track called El Presidente records who currently is the President of Colombia and notes his effects. If El
Presidente is Samper or Pastrana and Total Support is 60 or less,
advance the El Presidente marker 1 box rightward and carry out
the noted effect.

•	 If Samper, the Government will not collect Resources from
Aid during Propaganda Rounds (6.3.1; it may still do so via
Events).
•	 If Pastrana, the Government must immediately place 1 FARC
Zone (below).
•	 If Uribe, immediately remove all FARC Zones. (Events may
still place them.)
6.4.4 FARC Zones. Whenever Events or
the El Presidente track (6.4.3) specify that
a FARC Zone is to be placed, the Gov-

•	 The Government must immediately Redeploy any cubes (6.5;
judge Control, 6.2, at the moment that a FARC Zone is placed)
and remove any of its Bases there.
•	 Government Forces may not enter or be placed into a FARC
Zone Department (1.4.2), even by Event (5.1.1).

EXAMPLE: The “Zona de Convivencia” Event places a FARC
Zone into the Mountain Department with the most FARC pieces.
The Government player chooses among any Mountain spaces
tied for most FARC pieces.
PLAY NOTE: FARC Zones have no effect on Air Strikes (4.2.2),
Eradication (4.2.3), or the movement or placement of Insurgent
forces.
6.4.5 Elite Backing. AUC now may free Rally (3.3.1) in 1 space
with neither Opposition, nor Govt Control, nor FARC Control
(1.8).

6.5 Redeploy Phase

The Government relocates its forces as described below. Control
does not change until all Redeployment is complete.
6.5.1 The Government must move any Troops on LoCs or in
Departments without Government Bases to Govt-Controlled
spaces (1.8) that either are Cities or have Government Bases (if
no such spaces, then to Bogotá).
6.5.2 The Government may move any other Troops to such
Govt-Controlled Cities or Bases.
6.5.3 The Government may move any Police to any LoCs or
Govt-Controlled spaces.
6.5.4 Once all Redeployment is finished, Control of all Cities
and Departments adjusts per 1.8.
DESIGN AND PLAY NOTE: While Troops are the Government’s
main means of attacking Insurgents in the countryside, Police
are its main means of maintaining presence over time.

6.6 Reset Phase

Prepare for the next card as follows:

•	 Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
•	 Remove all Terror and Sabotage markers.
•	 Place any cards in the Insurgent Momentum holding boxes
onto the played cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply
(5.4).
•	 Flip all Guerrillas to Underground (1.4.3).
•	 Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw
deck’s new top card (2.3.8).
PLAY NOTE: In the final Round of the game, players should
conduct as much Civic Action and Agitation as possible (6.4.1-2)
and can skip the Redeploy and Reset phases (6.5-6).

7.0 VICTORY

Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and
on the Faction aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2), all
players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player does so or
if none does by game end, the Faction that reached the highest
victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd-highest comes in
2nd place, and so on. Ties go to Non-players, then Cartels, then
AUC, then FARC. (See also 1-player victory, 8.8.)

7.2 During Propaganda Rounds

Check victory at the start of each Propaganda Round (6.1).
Victory conditions are:
•	 Government: Total Support exceeds 60.
•	 FARC: Total Opposition plus the number of FARC Bases
exceeds 25.
•	 AUC: AUC has more Bases than FARC.
•	 Cartels: Cartels have more than 10 Bases and have Resources
above 40.

7.3 After Final Propaganda

If the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1) is completed without a
victory check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory
margin wins. A Victory Margin is the amount a Faction is beyond
or short of its victory condition set forth in 7.2.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has
reached its goal, negative or zero if it has not. See the Playbook’s
tutorial for a full example of victory determination.
•	
•	
•	
•	

Government: Total Support – 60.
FARC: Total Opposition + FARC Bases – 25.
AUC: AUC Bases – FARC Bases.
Cartels: Take the lower of the following: Cartels Bases – 10,
or Cartels Resources – 40.

STOP!
You have read all rules needed for 4 players or the no NonPlayer option (1.5, recommended if playing the first time).

8.0 NON-PLAYER FACTIONS

This section modifies the above rules with priorities that govern
actions by any Factions beyond those represented by a player, as
an option to substitute for players when fewer than four players
are available, including for solitaire (1.5). NOTE: If players
among themselves are running the Government and the three
Insurgent Factions, this entire section is not needed! “Non-players” can substitute for any of the four player Factions, but the
following combinations are recommended:
•	 With three players, use either the Cartels or AUC Non-player
and play the other three Factions.
•	 With two players, play Government and FARC and use the
Cartels and AUC Non-players.

•	 With one player, play Government or FARC and use the remaining three Non-players.
The Playbook features an extensive 1-player Example of Play
illustrating these rules.
DESIGN NOTE: Non-player Factions may not act as would
a player but rather create a dynamic setting with which the
player(s) must contend. Like players, they sometimes will help,
sometimes attack, one another.

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

The Sequence of Play aid sheet and Non-player flowcharts summarize the following rules.

•	 Non-player Government: Non-player Government uses its
flowchart (8.8) and Event Instructions (8.4.4) to determine
whether or not it plays an Event for which it is eligible.
2nd Eligible
Insurgent:
choose Ops

•	 Non-player Insurgents: 1st Eligible Non-player Insurgent
Factions whose symbol is leftmost on the Event’s card execute
the Event (2.3), if not leftmost, then Operations. 2nd Eligible
Non-player Insurgent Factions choose the Event when given
an option, unless the Event’s card has a gray
symbol, in
which case, Operations.
Exception—Insurgent Discord:
In a 2-player game (only) where Government is a player Faction,
Government chooses between an Event with effect or Operation
for any 2nd Eligible Non-player Faction with at least 1 Resource.
In any game where Government is a Non-player, Non-player
Insurgents only execute Events that meet at least one of the
following restrictions:

a.	The executing Faction places or moves pieces, gains Resources,
or gets free Operations or Special Activities.
b.	If AUC, the Event shifts spaces towards Active Support or
causes Terror in Opposition spaces.
c.	If FARC, the Event shifts spaces towards Active Opposition
or causes Terror in Support spaces.
d.	The Event would harm a player Faction by removing its pieces
or Resources, preventing it from executing specific Operations
or Special Activities, making it Ineligible, or—for player
FARC—by shifting spaces towards Active Support. DESIGN
NOTE: These restrictions prevent Insurgent Non-players from
helping an Insurgent player too much against a Non-player
Government.
•	 Ineffective Events. Regardless of the above, Non-player
Factions only opt for Events that would have an effect
(something happens, including Government Capabilities,
5.3) and opt for Momentum Events (5.4) when the next card
is “Propaganda” only if they would have an effect during
the Propaganda Round (“Alfonso Cano” and “Mexican
Traffickers”).

Andean Abyss
•	 Insufficient Resources. When a Non-player Insurgent is to
execute Operations but has 0 Resources, it Passes instead
(earning +1 Resource, 2.3.3). If a Non-player Faction hits 0
Resources while executing an Operation, it Operates in no
further spaces that card (it may execute a Special Activity).
When Non-player Government is to execute an Operation but
has too few Resources, it immediately (before executing any
Special Activity) follows the “if none” arrows on its flowchart
until either arriving at an Operation it can afford to execute or
Passing (to earn +3 Resources, 2.3.3).
•	 Operations Not Limited. Whenever a Non-player Faction is
to execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5), it instead executes a
normal Operation and (typically) Special Activity. Final Event
Card restrictions (2.3.9) do not apply to Non-players.
•	 No Shipping. Non-player Factions may not receive Operations
from Shipments (2.3.6).
INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: Non-player Cartels is 1st
Eligible for “Narco-Subs”. There are no Cartels pieces in coastal
spaces. Because the shaded text would have no effect, Cartels
executes Operations and a Special Activity.
8.1.1 Operations, Special Activities, and Events. To execute
a Non-player Faction’s Operations and Special Activities or a
specific Event, see the Non-Player flow charts and the relevant
rules below.
GUIDELINES: Carry out whatever actions apply to the maximum extent (such as with the most pieces allowed and only
as long as needed pieces are available). Normal requirements,
Resource costs, and procedures still apply.
EXAMPLE: Non-Player Terror requires Activating an Underground Guerrilla and costs 1 Resource per City or Department,
per 3.3.4.
OP NOT POSSIBLE: If none of a flowchart-designated Operation or Special Activity can be carried out, instead follow the
arrow (or circle) marked “if none” on the flowchart and execute
the next Operation or Special Activity indicated (even if the
normal conditions for selecting that action were not met). If the
“if none” instruction is to Pass, do so even if the Non-player has
Resources left.
NOTE: Each “if none” arrow points directly to an Instructions
box, bypassing decision diamonds; the diamonds’ conditions do
not apply when following the “if none” arrows. Conditions listed
in the Instructions boxes themselves still apply.
EXAMPLE: Cartels are to March but all their Guerrillas on
the map are spread 1 per Base space; it Rallies and Cultivates
instead, even with fewer than 10 pieces available.
8.1.2 Procedure Guidelines. Unless otherwise specified, once
spaces involved are selected, Non-player Factions:

•	 Place friendly Bases before Guerrillas or cubes. Non-player
Government alternates placing Police and Troops as far as
able, beginning with the fewest in the space (Police if even).
•	 Place Shipments with Underground Guerrillas before Active,
and with Guerrillas with other Shipments if possible (4.5.3).

13

•	 Attempt to remove enemy Bases, then Police, Troops,
Underground Guerrillas, and finally Active Guerrillas. Remove
pieces to be replaced even if no pieces are available to replace
them (1.4.1).
•	 If Insurgent, remove friendly Active before Underground
Guerrillas. Transfer Shipments about to be removed (4.5.3)
to their own then another Non-player’s Underground then
Active Guerrillas (FARC, then AUC, then Cartels), if possible.
Voluntarily transfer nothing else.
•	 If Government, alternate removing Troops and Police beginning
with whichever most in the space, but keeping the last Police in
each space as long as possible.
•	 Retain Shipments first to place Bases, then to gain +6
Resources.
•	 March so as to move as many Underground Guerrillas as possible without flipping them to Active (3.3.2). Where Activation
is unavoidable, move Active first. Within those priorities, move
Shipments first.
MARCH EXAMPLE: A group of Active and Underground
Non-player Guerrillas is to March into an otherwise empty space
with Support. By the rule above, only 3 of the Guerrillas in the
group would make the move, priority going to the Underground
Guerrillas.
PLAY NOTE: Players may transfer (1.5.1) to Non-player Factions normally, for example, Government to Non-player AUC.
8.1.3 Reading the Flowcharts. The Second Edition Non-Player
flowcharts show priorities with circled numbers (e.g., ❶,❷,①,②)
and colored letters (e.g., a , b ) to indicate their order and nature:

•	 Numbered priorities (e.g., ❶,①) are sequential priorities.
Execute the instructions in each sequential priority to the
maximum extent before moving to the next sequential priority
(8.3). Some top-level sequential priorities (black circles; e.g.,
❶,❷) contain further sequential priorities (white circles; e.g.,
①,②) that are parts of and sequential steps to that top-level
priority.
•	 Lettered priorities (e.g., a , b ) are nested priorities. Nested
priorities act as tie breakers within the sequential priorities to
which they are ordained. Each nested priority further narrows
the thus-far selected set of spaces or targets. For readability,
nested priorities have a shaded background.
NOTE: So as to provide a quicker reference, the flowcharts
abbreviate the rules below. Should you find a flowchart priority
unclear, please refer also to the corresponding text here.

8.2 Random Cities and Departments

If several candidate Cities or Departments have equal priority for
a Non-player Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select spaces
using the Random Citie or Department table:

•	 Roll the red, yellow, and green dice and refer to the table: red
indicates column, yellow indicates row of space trios, and
green indicates the space within the trio.
•	 If the resulting space is not a candidate, move down the column
until one is reached. Follow the arrows, moving from the

bottom of one column to the top of the next and from Chocó
to Cali (or just follow the gray arrows on the Random City or
Department map).
•	 If Panamá or Ecuador is a space (1.3.5), select it before the
other space in the box.
•	 Carry out as much of the action as possible in the candidate
reached, then roll again to select another, if needed.
PLAY NOTE: Use a die roll if the choice is among few spaces
and all players agree.

8.3 Random LoCs

To select a LoC, choose from candidates:
•	 With highest Econ, then
•	 Adjacent to a random City, then
•	 With an equal-chance die roll.

Sabotage only unSabotaged LoCs.
EXAMPLE: No 3-Econ LoCs are eligible but several 2-Econ
LoCs are. The first random City next to a 2-Econ LoC is Bogotá.
Designate the 3 adjacent LoCs with 2-Econ as 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6
,respectively, and roll a die to select one.

8.4 Non-Player Events

NOTE: If the Government is a player, Events will not always
benefit the executing Non-player Faction, as Non-player Insurgents assist one another.
8.4.1 Dual Use. Non-player Insurgents execute the shaded text
if the event is Dual Use (5.2); Non-player Government executes
unshaded text.
8.4.2 Placement. Place or relocate as many pieces (per 8.1.2) as
the Event, availability (1.4.1), and stacking (1.4.2) allow.
8.4.3 Where. Select spaces randomly (8.2-.3) unless otherwise
specified by Event special instructions (8.4.4). For shift spaces,
Non-player Insurgents select for the greatest change in Total
Support and Opposition; Non-player Government selects for
the greatest shift towards Active Support or the smallest shift
towards Active Opposition.
8.4.4 Event Instructions. Whenever a Non-player Faction has
the option to execute Event text, check for any special instructions for that Event:

•	 For all Non-player Insurgents (Cartels, AUC, or FARC), check
the Non-player sheet for whatever Faction’s symbol is leftmost
on the card.
•	 For Non-player Government, check the Non-player Government foldout.

8.5 Non-Player Cartels Actions

NOTE: It is not necessary to master the rules below for
specific Factions because they are summarized on the Non-player
foldouts.

•	 In any space with at least one Cartels Base and one cube where
all Cartel Guerrillas are Active, flip the Cartel Guerrillas
Underground.
•	 Then, in any others with at least 2 Cartels Guerrillas without
Shipments and fewer than 2 Bases, replace 2 Guerrillas with a
Base.
•	 Then, wherever Cartels have a Base and no Cartels Guerrillas,
place Guerrillas (equal to Population plus Bases, 3.3.1) or—if
no Guerrillas available—move up to 3 there from spaces
without Cartels Bases and flip them Underground.
•	 Finally, Rally—placing Guerrillas if available—in 1 other
Department as needed to then enable Cartels to Cultivate to
place a new Base (Population greater than 0, fewer than 2
Bases, and Cartels Guerrillas would outnumber Police, 4.5.1)
if none of the above Rally spaces already allow that.
CULTIVATE: Then, where Population >0 and Cartels Guerrillas
exceed Police (4.5.1):
•	 Cultivate to place a Base in a Department selected for Rally,
if possible.
•	 If not, Cultivate to relocate a Cartels Base to a City or
Department with none from a space with 2 Cartels Bases, if
possible.
•	 If not, Cartels instead attempt to Process per below.
PROCESS: Then:

•	 Place 2 Shipments (4.5.2), each into a (random) space with a
Cartels Guerrilla and Base (possibly resulting in the same space).
•	 If no such spaces exist, instead remove 1 Cartels Base (for +3
Resources) from a (random) space with 2 Cartels Bases.
•	 If no such space exists, Cartels execute no Special Activity.
8.5.2 March. If Rally conditions (8.5.1) are not met but a Shipment is available, instead March into a Department or City that
has fewer than 2 Bases (of any Faction) and is adjacent to a space
with 2 or more Cartels Guerrillas.

•	 March all adjacent Cartels Guerrillas but the last 1 in any space
with a Cartels Base (and as limited by 8.1.2) into the destination.
PROCESS: Then Process per 8.5.1 above.
8.5.3 Terror. If neither Rally (8.5.1) nor March (8.5.2) conditions
are met, instead execute Terror in up to 3 spaces with at least 1
Population (and Underground Cartels Guerrillas, 3.3.4):

•	 If Government is a Non-player and FARC is a player, select
Opposition, then Support, then Neutral spaces; otherwise select
Support, then Opposition, then Neutral spaces (1.6).
BRIBE: Then, Bribe (4.5.4) in 3 spaces with Cartels and enemy
pieces: first player then Non-player, within that Government, then
FARC, then AUC. Remove pieces per 8.1.2. (Pay 3 Resources per
space.) If no such spaces (or Cartels have less than 3 Resources),
execute no Special Activity.

8.5.1 Rally. If Cartels have at least 10 pieces (Guerrillas plus
Bases) available or if Cartels Rally could replace 2 Guerrillas
with a Base, Rally in up to 3 of the following spaces:

ground AUC Guerrillas per 3.3.4):

8.6 Non-Player AUC Actions

8.6.1 Rally. If AUC has at least 6 Guerrillas available or
would place a Base with a Rally, Rally in up to 3 of the following
Departments or Cities (without Opposition, 3.3.1):
•	 In any with at least one AUC Base and one cube where all
AUC Guerrillas are Active, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
•	 Then, in any others with at least 3 AUC Guerrillas and fewer
than 2 Bases, replace 2 Guerrillas with a Base.
•	 Then place Guerrillas in any others with FARC Bases (if any
with- out Opposition); then with AUC Bases (Population plus
Bases, 3.3.1); and finally in other Departments or Cities—if
any AUC Bases are available, first where there are exactly 1
or 2 AUC Guerrillas already.
EXTORT: Then Extort wherever possible (where AUC forces
include an Underground Guerrilla and exceed enemy, 4.4.1). If
no Extort possible, AUC executes no Special Activity.
ELITE BACKING: During the Support Phase, free Rally (6.4.5)
in a space with no Govt Control or FARC Control (1.8). Place a
Base if possible, otherwise Guerrillas per 8.6.1 above.
8.6.2 March. If Rally conditions (8.6.1) are not met and fewer
than half of the spaces with a FARC Base have an AUC Guerrilla,
instead March as follows:

•	 First into a (random) City or Department with with a FARC
piece—a FARC Base if possible—and no AUC Guerrillas.
Among such spaces, choose first one that would allow the
moving Guerrillas to stay Underground. March with all
adjacent AUC Guerrillas (as limited by 8.1.2), but leave 1 per
space with an AUC Base or any FARC piece.
•	 Then March with the largest group of AUC Guerrillas yet to
move, to a space closer to a FARC piece (a Base if possible),
leaving 1 Guerrilla with an AUC Base or any FARC piece.
EXTORT: Then Extort per 8.6.1.
8.6.3 Attack. If neither Rally nor March (8.6.1-2) conditions
are met and no space with a FARC Base has an Underground
AUC Guerrilla, instead Attack in up to 3 spaces (with AUC
Guerrillas, 3.3.3):
•	 Target enemy Guerrillas so as to take Shipments, then FARC,
then Government.
•	 Attack where such targeting (to take a Shipment or strike FARC
or Government) is possible and there is an Underground or at
least 3 total AUC Guerrillas, selecting first those spaces with
the most AUC Guerrillas.
AMBUSH: Ambush (per 4.4.1, with an Underground AUC Guerrilla) in the Attack space with the fewest total AUC Guerrillas.
If tied, chose first where a Shipment is targeted, then FARC,
then Government.

•	 If none has an Underground AUC Guerrilla, AUC executes no
Special Activity.
8.6.4 Terror. If neither Rally nor March (8.6.1-2) conditions are
met and a space does have a FARC Base and an Underground
AUC Guerrilla, execute Terror in up to 3 spaces (with Under-

•	 First, in 1 space with a FARC Base and fewer Police than AUC
Guerrillas.
•	 Then, in 1 other City or Department with any FARC piece.
If Government is a Non-player, only select a space without
Support.
•	 Finally, in other Cities or Departments. If Non-player Government, select a space without Support.
ASSASSINATE: Then Assassinate wherever Terror occurred and
AUC Guerrillas outnumber Police (4.4.2). Remove Guerrillas to
take Shipments (4.4.3), then remove FARC, then Government,
then Cartels (all per 8.1.2).
•	 If all Terror spaces have too many Police or no enemy, AUC
executes no Special Activity.

8.7 Non-Player FARC Actions

8.7.1 Rally. If FARC has at least 9 Guerrillas available
or could place a Base with a Rally, Rally in all the following
Departments or Cities (without Support, 3.3.1):
•	 First, in all such spaces with Active FARC Guerrillas, a FARC
Base, and any cubes, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
•	 Then, in all others with at least 2 FARC Guerrillas without
Shipments and fewer than 2 Bases, replace 2 Guerrillas with
a Base.
•	 Then, in others with at least one FARC Base, place Guerrillas
(Population plus Bases, 3.3.1).
•	 Finally, in 1 other Department or City, place a Guerrilla, if possible where there are exactly 1 or 2 FARC Guerrillas already,
otherwise randomly.
EXTORT: Then Extort (where FARC forces exceed all enemy,
4.3.1):

•	 In each space with at least 2 Underground FARC Guerrillas,
and
•	 On 1 LoC with an Underground FARC Guerrilla, lowest
Economic value first.
•	 If no such spaces exist, FARC executes no Special Activity.
8.7.2 March. If Rally conditions (8.7.1) are not met and no
Support space (1.6) nor LoC has either an Underground FARC
Guerrilla or a total of at least 3 FARC pieces, instead March:

•	 First—unless the next Propaganda card played will be final
(2.4.1)—onto all unSabotaged LoCs (highest Economic value
first, 8.3), until any 1 Guerrilla is on each adjacent LoC. (Cost
is 0.)
•	 Then, into up to 3 spaces without FARC Control, each with at
least 1 Population at Support or Neutral—first to spaces that
allow moving Guerrillas to stay Underground.
•	 Finally, into 1 more space with at least 1 Population and adjacent to a space with the most FARC Guerrillas who would
move, per the guidelines below, but have not yet done so.
GUIDELINES: March with as many FARC Guerrillas as possible (per 8.1.2), but only from adjacent spaces that have Active
Opposition, 0 Population (Departments), or Sabotage (LoCs).

Andean Abyss

Leave in place 1 FARC Guerrilla, Underground if possible, in
each origin space if any Faction’s Base is there.
NOTE: Select equal-priority origin or destination spaces in
random order (8.2-8.3). For an illustration of Non-player FARC
March, see the Playbook.
EXTORT: Then Extort per 8.7.1.
8.7.3 Attack. If Rally (8.7.1) and March (8.7.2) conditions are
not met and FARC has more Resources than does Government,
instead Attack (with FARC Guerrillas, 3.3.3). Attack in the
following spaces, targeting a Shipment FARC could take, then
AUC, then Government, then Cartels:

•	 First, anywhere with 3 or more FARC Guerrillas and an enemy.
•	 Then, in 1 City or Department—or, if none, LoC—with an
Underground FARC Guerrilla and a target above, where FARC
would then Ambush per the rule below).
AMBUSH: Ambush (per 4.3.2, with an Underground FARC
Guerrilla) in the Attack space with the fewest total FARC Guerrillas. If tied, choose first where a Shipment is targeted, then AUC,
then Government, then Cartels. If none has an Underground
FARC Guerrilla, execute no Special Activity.
8.7.4 Terror. If Rally (8.7.1) and March (8.7.2) conditions are
not met and FARC has the same or fewer Resources than does
Government, instead execute Terror (with Underground FARC
Guerrillas, 3.3.4):

•	 First, on all unSabotaged LoCs (cost is 0).
•	 Then, in other spaces where Kidnap could take Resources or
Shipments (4.3.3), until there are 3 such spaces (including
LoCs).
•	 Finally, in all other spaces with at least 1 Population not in
Active Opposition.
KIDNAP: Then Kidnap (4.3.3) in up to 3 spaces selected for
Terror (where FARC Guerrillas outnumber Police):

•	 First, on LoCs, then in Cities (target Government), and finally
in Departments with Cartels Bases.
•	 Skip spaces where the target has 0 Resources and no Shipment.
If no targets, FARC executes no Special Activity.
8.7.5 Agitate. Non-player FARC Agitates (6.4.2) to the maximum
extent possible.

If FARC has too few Resources to Agitate everywhere or if “Alfonso Cano” is in play, FARC Agitates first where fewest Terror
markers, then where Support, then where highest Population,
then randomly. Remove Terror only if a shift would be achieved.

8.8 Non-Player Government Actions

8.8.1 Pass or Play? If the next revealed Event card is a Government Capability (5.3) and the current Event card is not,
Government Passes (in order to be Eligible for the Capability).

NOTE: If several Capability cards appear in a row, Non-player
Government will take the first one in order to be Eligible on the
next unrevealed card.

8.8.2 Event or Operation? If Government does not Pass to gain
a Capability on the next card, the Sequence of Play allows it to
play the current Event (2.3.4), and the Event would be effective
(8.1), check the Non-player Government Event Instructions on
the relevant aid foldout (8.4.4) to see whether it will execute the
Event or choose an Operation and Special Activity.
8.8.3 Assault. If Government neither Passed nor played the
Event, and an Assault alone (without Air Lift or Air Strike) now
would remove a Shipment, a player’s Base, or at least 4 Guerrillas
from any combination of Factions, the Government Assaults.
Before the Assault, add a Special Activity per 8.8.7 below. Then
Assault for a maximum of 9 Resources as follows:
•	 First, in whatever Cities and Departments (only) Assault can
remove the largest number of Insurgent Bases, then to add
Government Control of the most Population possible, then to
remove the most Shipments, then to remove the last Insurgent
piece in each space. Within that, first select the space with
highest Population; within that to target player pieces before
Non-player pieces; within that FARC, then AUC, then Cartels.
•	 Then, if the unshaded “Tapias” Government Capability is in
effect, Assault on LoCs with active Guerrillas and cubes, in
order from highest to lowest Econ.
8.8.4 Train. If Government did not Pass, play the Event, or
Assault, and it has 10+ pieces of any types available or is able
to buy Civic Action (per 6.4.1 and 8.8.8), Train in a maximum
of 4 spaces as follows:
•	 First, in up to 3 spaces, place exactly 6 cubes per 8.1.2. Select
spaces first to change Control of the most Population, then to
add either Police or Troops where there are none yet (Police
first), then in random spaces.
•	 Then add a Special Activity per 8.8.7.
•	 Then buy Civic Action per 8.8.8 for the largest shift possible
in a space with no Terror, first in a Train space, otherwise in
1 additional space where Civic Action is possible (placing up
to 6 cubes per 8.1.2 if able).
•	 If no Civic Action occurred, Train to replace 3 Government
Cubes with a Government Base in the Department with the
highest Population above 0 and that has no Government Base
already, room for a Base, and at least 5 cubes.

8.8.5 Patrol. If the Government did not Pass, execute the Event,
Assault, or Train, and if Guerrillas on any LoC either are Underground or outnumber any cubes on that LoC (including if there
are no cubes at all there), Patrol. Move Police then Troops, without moving the last of either type from any City or Department:

•	 First to equal Guerrillas on each LoC possible—adding 1
extra cube if the shaded “7th Special Forces” Capability is in
effect—from the space with the largest number of cubes that
are able to reach that LoC.
•	 Then move cubes that have not yet moved, from spaces with at
least 4 cubes and Government Control, within that, from those
with the largest number of cubes above the number needed to
maintain Government Control, until as many Cities as possible
have at least 3 cubes, Government Control, and both Troops
and Police.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Andean Abyss
•	 Then move 1 Police to each 3-Econ LoC that doesn’t have any
Police yet.
•	 Then Assault on LoCs to remove the most Insurgents possible.
•	 Finally, add a Special Activity per 8.8.7.
8.8.6 Sweep. If Government did not Pass, execute the Event,
Assault, or Train, and if no LoC has either any Underground
Guerrillas or more Active Guerrillas than cubes, Sweep. Before
the Operation, add a Special Activity per 8.8.7. Then Sweep for
a maximum of 12 Resources as follows:

•	 During the following movements, do not remove Government
Control anywhere, nor reduce any Support space to fewer than 3
cubes, nor reduce any LoC to fewer cubes than Guerrillas—plus
one extra cube if the shaded “7th SF” Capability is in effect.
•	 Select Sweep spaces first where it is possible to Activate all
Guerrillas, then to add Government Control; within those
priorities select Cities first, then Departments; within that, first
spaces with Support, then where cubes are already present,
then elsewhere; within that, in order from largest to smallest
Population.
•	 Move in just enough Troops first to add Government Control,
then to Activate all Guerrillas, then to add at least one Troop
where there are only Police present (even if that Troop is not
needed for Control or Activation).
•	 If the unshaded “NDSC” Capability is in effect, also move in
one Police to each Sweep space where there is none already.
•	 After movement, Activate as many Underground Guerrillas
as possible in all Sweep spaces.
8.8.7 Government Special Activities. Whenever the above rules
for an Operation call for the Non-player Government to add a
Special Activity (in the middle of a Train Operation, 8.8.4; after
a Patrol Operation, 8.8.4; or before an Assault, 8.8.4, or Sweep,
8.8.6), execute one Special Activity selected in the following order:
ERADICATE: If the Cartels Faction is controlled by a player
and has 8 or more Bases, Eradicate to remove the most Cartels
Bases possible from a Department that is not already selected for
Assault. If there is more than one such space, select first that with
the smallest Population, then (among equal Pop) an Opposition
Department before one with Support or Neutral, at random. If
no such space exists, or if the Cartels have fewer than 8 Bases
on the map, instead Air Strike.
AIR STRIKE: If Government did not Eradicate and the accompanying Operation is an Assault, Patrol, or Sweep, Air Strike to
remove a player AUC’s Base, if possible, then a player FARC’s
Base. If no such Base can be removed, instead remove the last
Insurgent piece (whether a player’s or Non-player’s) from a
space, first on the LoC with the highest Econ value and an Active
Guerrilla, then in the Department with the highest Population;
within that, remove a player piece before a Non-player one, then
choose randomly. If no such target is available or the accompanying Operation was Train, instead Air Lift.
AIR LIFT: If Government did not Air Strike, Air Lift Troops
from the City or Department with at least 4 cubes and Government Control, first from the largest number of Troops above

17

those needed to maintain Government Control, and—within
that—where the Non-player Government would not build a Base
(because there is no room, or the space is a Department with a
Government Base already or a City, or there are no Government
Bases available). Select the destination as follows:

•	 If the accompanying Operation is Assault or Sweep, Air Lift
first to the highest priority space for that Operation that has too
few cubes to complete the Operation (regardless of whether or
not Government will actually execute the Operation there). If
there is no such space, instead Air Lift to a Department or City
with Police but no Troops (select randomly if there is more
than one).
•	 If the accompanying Operation is Train or Patrol, Air Lift first
to a space where the Troops added are needed to enable Civic
Action, within that, to the space that would allow the largest
possible shift towards Active Support. If there is no such space,
instead Air Lift to the highest-Population Department where
the added Troops would enable a Government Base to be
built (5+ cubes, no Govt Base, and room for a Base). If none
possible, then Air Lift to add Troops where there are Police but
no Troops. If no such destination, Air lift to add Government
Control to the highest Population space able (where at least 1
Population).
If none of the above is possible, instead Eradicate.
ERADICATE: If none of the above Special Activities were executed, Government will Eradicate where it can remove the most
Cartel Bases (regardless both of whether the Cartels Faction is a
player or Non-player and of how many Bases it has on the map)
from a Department that is not about to be selected for Assault
(per 8.8.3). If there is more than one space that would allow
the maximum possible number of Cartel Bases to be removed,
select first the candidate space with the smallest Population, then
one with any Opposition. If there is no such space, Non-player
Government will not execute any Special Activity.
RETURN TO OPS: After executing that (or no) Special Activity,
return to the accompanying Operation if there are any instructions
left to execute.
8.8.8 Civic Action. Whenever Non-player Government buys
Civic Action, whether during Training (3.2.1) or the Support
Phase (6.4), it does so as follows:

•	 Except during the final Propaganda Round, buy no Civic
Action that would reduce Government Resources below 15.
•	 During Train Operations, execute Civic Action for the greatest
possible shift towards Active Support in a space with no Terror.
•	 During the Support Phase, first execute Civic Action to Passive
Support wherever possible; within that, first where no Terror
then elsewhere; within that first for the largest reduction of
Opposition, then the largest increase of Support, then randomly. Then, if there are still Resources available, execute
Civic Action wherever it is possible to bring spaces to Active
Support, first in the highest Population.

Andean Abyss

8.8.9 Propaganda Rounds.

SABOTAGE: During the Sabotage Phase of (6.2), if the unshaded
“7th Special Forces” Government Capability is in play, Non-player Government will use it at the end of the phase, first to remove
any Sabotage from the three Econ 3 LoCs, then to remove Terror
from those spaces that would have the highest priority for Civic
Action without Terror per 8.8.8, and finally to remove Sabotage
from other LoCs with the highest total Econ possible.
REDEPLOY: In the Redeploy Phase (6.5), Non-player Government relocates Troops and Police as follows. (Do not adjust
Control until after all Redeploy movement.)
•	 First, move all Troops from LoCs and Departments without
Government Bases to the side of the map.
•	 Then move Police, each from the space that currently has
most Police that have not yet moved and without removing
the last Police from any City or Department; first to maintain
Government Control in Population 1+ Departments with no
Government Bases, then to equal the number of Cartel or AUC
Guerrillas (whichever is highest) in each City or Department,
then to put 1 Police in each Population 1+ space with none, then
to put 1 Police on each Econ 3 LoC; finally to have at least 3
cubes in each Support Department with no Government Base
even if fewer than that are required to maintain Government
Control.
•	 Then return all Redeploying Troops to the map, first so each
Government Base then City in order from highest to lowest
Population has Government Control and at least 3 cubes, then
1 Troop to each City and Department possible that only has
Police; then move all other Redeploying Troops to Bogotá if
possible, otherwise to a random City with Government Control.
(Then adjust Control.)

8.9 1-Player Victory

The player in a 1-player game never wins during Propaganda
Rounds (7.2). To succeed, the player must avoid any Non-player
win and have the highest victory margin after the final Round
(7.3). Subtract the highest Non-player margin from that of the
player to determine the degree of success:

•	 0 or less—Failure. The player’s faction has lost its bid for
power. While the Government fights for legitimacy, illegal
armed groups abound and rule key territory. Colombia is
descending into chaos.
•	 1 to 3—Stalemate. The player’s faction has the upper hand,
but the other factions are not beaten. While the insurgent tide is
stemmed, illegal groups remain strong. Years of war lie ahead.
•	 4 to 8—Progress. While contenders remain, the player’s
faction is clearly dominant and will rule the nation in the long
run.
•	 9 or more—Triumph. The player’s faction has won decisively,
shattering its enemies so badly that they will not be able to
challenge the new ruling order for years if ever.
EXAMPLE: A solo Government player has avoided Non-player
victory over 4 Propaganda Rounds. At game end, with just 1
AUC and 2 FARC Bases on the map, AUC has a –1 victory
margin—the highest of the Non-players. Total Support is 61, so
the Government victory margin is +1. The player’s margin is 2
above AUC’s: “Stalemate”.

WHAT DOES VICTORY MEAN?

If Government - Government strategy is a model success.
Guerrillas are deserting or demobilizing across the country.
Narco-traffickers remain but have little political power. Improved
security is leading to economic growth, and stability is in sight.
If FARC - The Marxist-Leninist revolution sweeps the country,
redistributing the farm lands of the great estates to the poor...
and getting rid of as many former land-owners as possible in
the process.
If AUC - Colombia is in the iron grip of the conservative
land-owners and their death squads.
If Cartels - Ever more prosperous drug runners have free rein
in the country, buying any politician they need to stay in control.

						               													<description>(from GMT website:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world&amp;rsquo;s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state.  A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&amp;mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame&amp;#10; From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&amp;rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&amp;mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Series: COIN (GMT), Volume I&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).  A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.   Series: COIN (GMT) Volume II is Cuba Libre&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Castro's Insurgency 1957-1958, Volume III is A Distant Plain&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan, and Volume IV is Fire in the Lake&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Insurgency in Vietnam.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TIME SCALE: multiple years per Propaganda round&amp;#10;MAP SCALE: Area Movement&amp;#10;UNIT SCALE: Varies&amp;#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1-4 (full solitaire system)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DESIGNER: Volko Ruhnke&amp;#10;DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen&amp;#10;MAP and CARD ART: Chechu Nieto&amp;#10;COUNTER ART: Chechu Nieto &amp;amp; Xavier Carrascosa&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
