1.	 Introduction
Hail, stranger! These pages will lead you through the fantasy tale of the
heroes who awoke from the dead and were made immortal to save the
kingdom.
Ye intruders beware! Crushing death and grief, soaked with blood of the
trespassing thief…

Welcome to the world of
Sword &amp; Sorcery!

4

1.1  Game

Overview

Sword and Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1
to 5 players embody heroes with unique powers. Recalled from death, they
fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game
system itself, to save the kingdom and break the spell binding their souls.
The heroes, recalled as immortal ghost souls, but still weakened by the
resurrection, grow stronger during their story-driven Quests. By acquiring
Soul Points, players can regenerate the hero’s soul, returning them to
legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and
powerful artifacts.
Sword &amp; Sorcery combines the team gameplay of the most famous
MMORPGs with the experience of fast-paced action RPGs to forge the
Ultimate Heroic Fantasy Adventure!

The most rare and powerful weapons
in the entire kingdom, they can only be
found during Quests explicitly listing
them.
Each soul weapon has different attack
values printed on both sides, and can
be recognized by the soul weapon tag
in the lower right corner.

Unless differently indicated, cards provided by Sword &amp; Sorcery
expansions MUST be shuffled into the matching decks.

2.2  Setup
The board game setup depends entirely upon the story and Quest you
want to play. All setup instructions are covered in the Storybook manual,
but for a quick setup, we suggest organizing the game components in this
way:
Each player chooses or randomly selects a Hero card, and takes the
matching (in terms of class and colors) Hero Sheet, Soul Gem token, and
Figure.
Depending on the Quest rules, the party may receive Soul Points, which
must be shared, and some Crowns (coins) each hero can use in the
Emporium to purchase items before the Quest begins.
Each hero starts the Quest with full health.
The minimum number of heroes required to play is 2.
If a player wants to play with more than one hero, each hero must act
independently, as if it is controlled by a different player. For instance, a
person who controls 3 heroes in play counts as 3 distinct players.
Note: A hero is considered in play as long as he is alive (i.e. not in
Ghost Soul Form, section 11.1, page 38).

♦♦

Arrange the map tiles.
Prepare and shuffle the Event deck.
Prepare and shuffle the Enemy deck.
Place figures, Shadows, tokens, and cards on the map.

2.2.1  Setting Up the Battlefield
The “Quest Setup” section of each Quest in the Storybook contains all
instructions to build the battlefield with the designated map tiles and
tokens. Map tiles are printed on two sides and may be combined in many
different ways. If a scenario shows a map tile as separate from the others, it
represents a zone that can only be accessed by following the Quest special
rules.

3.	 Terrain Structure
Each map tile is composed of a variable number of areas through which
the two factions in the game, Heroes (gray figures) and Enemies (colored
figures), move to do battle.
The graphics of the background of the map tile make it easy to distinguish
each area by defining the tile edges in different ways, such as:
♦♦

♦♦
♦♦

Topsoil: present on the connection edges of each tile. It always
divides the areas.
Floor pattern: change from a marble area to grass, for example.
Repeated Ornaments: stones or floor frames, for example.
Note: If unsure about identifying a specific area, remember that
each area can also be identified by a sight mark
.

Each map tile is identified by: Number-Letter. The number identifies the
tile and the letter indicates the side, A or B.
The combination of these two elements uniquely identifies every map tile.

The three main aspects about controlling/dominating an area are:
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

There are no limits to the number of figures (of both factions) in a
single area.
K.O.ed figures count as zero (0) for controlling/dominating the
area. This means, if a faction has only K.O.ed figures in area, a
single figure of the opposite faction can control and dominate the
area.
Dominating an area grants the supremacy bonus during attacks
(section 9.1, page 34).

The check to determine control or domination of an area by a faction must
be performed each time the game calls for it, usually before an attack,
to resolve some Encounter and Event cards, or to activate a particular
character effect. In any case, an area is never considered controlled or
dominated by a faction, if the opposing faction does not have at least one
figure in the area.

Controlling An Area Example

Maps Example

Areas are considered adjacent when they share at least one
common movement edge. Areas separated by walls or tile edges
are not considered to be adjacent.

3.1  Controlling/Dominating

An Area

Shae can move in the central area to help the other heroes
by using her Sneak Attack power because the Heroes faction
controls the Area (3 VS 2).
At the same time, the two Gremlins are controlling and dominating
Thorgar’s area, this meaning they will obtain the Banding power
bonus and the supremacy bonus during their attacks.

The number of figures from the two factions (Heroes and Enemies) in a
single area influences different factors and rules of the game:
♦♦

♦♦

Controlling an area: a faction controls an area when it has
numerical superiority, in terms of figures, compared to the opposing
faction.
Dominating an area: a faction dominates an area when it has at
least twice the number of figures, compared to the opposing faction.

Note: Dominating the area counts also as controlling it.

3.2  Types

of Terrain

Normally, a hero can move from one area to an adjacent area by spending
one movement point (see Movement, section 6.1 page 21); however, some
terrain can block or limit movement in different ways. The areas containing
these particular terrains are divided in two categories, Architectural and
Hindrances, defined as follows:

3.3  Area

Each area may also contain additional elements, represented by the
following tokens:
A door resides on the edge of two adjacent areas.
It may not be crossed and blocks L.O.S.. A hero can
open it by standing in any adjacent area and spending
(section 6.4.1, page 23).
one Free Action

3.2.1  Architectural
A thick and dark wall pattern may not be crossed and
blocks L.O.S. for any hero/enemy.
Areas which are totally separated by a blocking side are
not considered to be adjacent.
Note: The color of the wall may slightly vary, based
on the map background.

When opened, draw and resolve a Trap card (as detailed
in the next section), and remove the door token from
the map. It cannot be closed again.

Door

A locked door counts as a door with one exception:
		
A hero can open it by spending one action
(section 6.3.2, page 23), instead of a Free Action

Blocking Side

3.2.2  Hindrances
There are three types of Hindrances:
The barrier side is identified by a Blue map scroll
printed near the edge of an area on the map.
It indicates non-flying heroes/enemies may not cross
Barrier Side that edge to reach the adjacent area.
The barrier blocks the movement path only in one direction, from the
area where the Blue scroll is printed. This means heroes/enemies coming
from the opposite area are able to cross it.
♦♦
♦♦

A deadly area is identified by a Red map scroll with the
HP icon printed on the map.
Hero movement into or through (i.e. not exiting) this
Deadly Area area causes a wound (1 HP) to the hero.
Enemies are not affected by this hindrance.

.

Locked Door

Chest

A chest may contain several treasures. A hero in the
same area can open it by spending one action
(section 6.3.2, page 23).

When opened, draw and resolve one Trap card, and
draw a number of Treasure cards/Crowns equal to the value written on the
back side of the chest token. When finished, remove the chest from the
map.

The barrier side does not block L.O.S.
Areas separated by a barrier side are still considered to be
adjacent for ranged attacks.

A difficult area is identified by a Red map scroll with
the movement icon printed on the map.
Hero movement into or through (i.e. not exiting)
Difficult Area this area costs 2 movement points
instead of 1. 	
Enemies are not affected by this hindrance.

Elements

Magic Lock

When a magic lock is present, the associated door or
chest cannot be opened as usual. A magic lock token can
only be removed by a hero carrying the magic key of the
same color, as a Free Action
. Once the magic lock is
removed, the relative door/chest follows normal rules.

Typically, once a hero acquires a magic key, he keeps it
until the end of the Quest. If the hero carrying a magic
key dies, the key token must be placed on the map in the
Magic Key area occupied by the hero’s figure. Another hero may
pick up the token as a Free Action
. The
management of magic keys may vary from Quest to Quest and in these
cases, it is detailed in the storybook.

This token represents an area that may contain treasure,
but also danger! A hero in the same area can spend one
action
to perform a search (section 6.3.6, page 23).
, then
check and apply the result indicated on the token. When
finished, remove the token from the map.

Search Area Flip the Search Area token and roll a Red die

It is not possible to search a token more than once.

10

Wall tokens are used to change the shape of a map
tile by blocking some of the edges. When present,
they follow all the rules of the architectural blocking
sides.

Walls

Note: Movement across any non-blocking terrain/
element represents a legal movement path.
Attempting to move across a blocking terrain/
element represents an illegal movement path and
is not allowed for heroes or enemies.

Terrain Example

3.3.1  Traps
Poisonous Gas

Unless Save:
each hero
within 1 area
suffers Poison

I

Each time a hero opens any kind of door, a chest,
or when the game requires, the active hero must
draw and resolve one card from the Trap deck.
Read and apply the effects, starting from the
position of the trap on the map.			
Save rolls (section 5.2.4, page 20) must be
performed by all heroes within the area of
effect of the trap (following legal movement
paths), ignoring L.O.S.
Note: Doors reside on the edge between two
areas. Each of them counts as 1 (i.e. 0 does
not exist on a door’s trap.)

Trap Example

Ecarus begins his move, but cannot reach the Gremlin, because
he spends his 3 movement points to move 2 areas: area 1 costs 1
point, but area 2 costs 2 points (as it is difficult terrain). In his
turn, the gremlin moves, ignoring difficult terrain, and attacks
Ecarus.

Laegon can attack the Raider beyond the barrier with a ranged
weapon.

Shae the rogue opens the chest triggering the trap. 		
Due to her ability, she must draw two Trap cards and play one,
selecting between “Lightning” and “Pentacle.” She plays
“Lightning,” so all heroes within 2 areas must try to save versus
the trap, then both Trap cards are discarded.

Ecarus opens the door triggering the trap. He and Thorgar must
try to save versus the “Flames” trap because they are within 1
area. Auriel is safe because she is out of range.

11

3.4  Line

Of Sight

The term Line of Sight (L.O.S.) refers to visibility from a source
character to a target character or other element in the battlefield
and is based on the Sight Marks printed on each area of the map
tiles. When it is possible to trace a straight line from the sight mark
inside the source area to the sight mark of the destination area,
without crossing:

L.O.S. Example

A blocking terrain/element,
an external map tile edge (the edge of a map tile not connected to
another tile),
♦♦ areas with enemy figures different from the target’s own area
(only if the Source Character is a hero),
then there is a legal L.O.S.!
♦♦
♦♦

Attacks, items, and powers may only be performed/used against a target
within L.O.S., except where indicated differently.
Note: Hero figures never block L.O.S., while enemy figures block
the L.O.S. only when the source character is a hero.
This means enemies can always see through other enemies and heroes
can see through other heroes.

3.4.1  Fog Of War

Laegon and the Green Gremlin can see each other. Laegon and
the Blue Orc Warrior are both hidden by the bend in the forest
(the L.O.S. line crosses the edge of the 7B tile). Laegon can’t
see the Red Orc Shaman because the Gremlin blocks the L.O.S.;
however, the Orc Shaman can see Laegon because enemies don’t
block L.O.S. of other enemies.

Hero and enemy vision is limited to 5 areas.
This means, unless otherwise specified, nobody can view, interact with,
or attack anything more than 5 areas away, including revealing Shadows
(section 15.4, page 44), simply because there is no L.O.S. over that
distance.

3.4.2  Determining Distances
During the game, determining the distance between two areas will happen
for several reasons: moving from one area to another, attacking, activating
an enemy, etc…
Range is represented as a number surrounded by two curly braces:
♦♦
♦♦

0 means in the current character’s area.

Ecarus and the Green Raider can see each other. Thorgar and
the Green Raider are both hidden by the wall (the L.O.S. crosses
the wall of the 6A tile). Thorgar and the Red Gremlin can see
each other.

1 means up to 1 area of distance from the current character’s
area.

2 means up to 2 areas of distance from the current character’s
area.
and so on...
♦♦

While calculating range, the terrain type and terrain elements of the areas
must be considered.
For example, a barrier terrain may negate movement, yet allow ranged
attacks. Sometimes, this will cause a difference between the movement
range and the attack range.

12

Laegon and Thorgar can see Blue Orc Warrior and the Green
Gremlin, but not the Red Orc Shaman (the L.O.S. is blocked by
enemies in 13B map tile). All enemies can see both heroes.

Distance Example

4.	Game Sequence
Sword &amp; Sorcery is played over a variable number of Rounds.
The length of the game is defined by the Quest.
Each Round is subdivided into the following phases and sub-phases:

For Auriel, the Blue Orc Shaman is at distance 3 for movement,
as the barrier allows L.O.S., but not movement from her area.
However, Auriel can use her wand 2 against the Orc, as she is
at distance 1 from him, in terms of ranged combat.

Although Shae is just 1 area away from the Red Raider, she
cannot use her Knives (Projectiles) 1 , since the wall blocks
L.O.S., thus Shae must first move to get into L.O.S., and then
use her Action to perform the attack.

This phase has four steps:
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

Effects Cleanup: all item &amp; power effects and cleanups are applied
following this order:
❖❖ Apply damage, such as Fire, Poison, etc.
❖❖ Apply all other effects, simultaneously.
❖❖ Clean up &amp; Refresh, like magic shields, etc.
❖❖ Hero bookmarks, get flipped up.
Powers Refresh: each used power with the refresh icon in the first
position must be refreshed by flipping the card over.
Powers Cooldown: each used power without the refresh icon in the
first position rotates clockwise 90° to reduce its cool down (section
7.1, page 27).
Soul Enhancement/Resurrection: heroes can spend as many
Soul Points contained in the shared pool as desired to perform the
following functions, in any order they wish:
❖❖ Enhance Soulrank (section 5.3.1, page 20), to increase their
powers and stats.
❖❖ Resurrect a Ghost Soul (a dead hero, section 11.3, page 39), in
an area with an active Shrine.

4.2  Battle

Phase

During the Battle Phase, each player (the Active hero) plays his Hero Turn
and then one Enemy Turn.
During these two turns, he is always considered the Active hero.
Afterward, play passes to the next chosen hero (who becomes the new
Active hero).
Players may carry out their turns (always hero first and then enemy) in any
order, until the last player finishes his turns.
Note: Ghost Soul heroes (dead heroes) affect the Battle Phase in a
different way, as detailed in the next sections.

4.2.1  Hero Turn
During his turn, a hero may perform different activities:
♦♦
♦♦
♦♦
♦♦

Movement: to move across the areas.
Combat: to attack enemies.
Action: to perform special tasks.
Free Action: to execute very quick operations.

Activities may be performed in any order, and usually any hero may
perform each activity at least once per turn.
While the Movement activity is limited to once per turn (except due to a
special effect), the number of Combat and Action activities performed by
a hero during his turn increases along with his Soulrank, as displayed in
the hero Soul Gem (section 5.3, page 20).

14

The main rule governing activities is, unless expressly specified, it is
not possible to interrupt, and later resume, Movement ( ) to perform
), or to interrupt, and later resume, Combat to perform
combat (
Movement.
) or Free
However, it is always possible to perform an Action (
Action (
) during Movement or Combat, for example, to use one or
more items &amp; powers to increase movement or to improve an attack.
The Hero Turn ends when the hero cannot (or will not) perform any
other activity. To keep track of the turn status, each hero can use the hero
bookmark token:

Hero Bookmark
Gem Up Side

Gem Down Side

During the Time Phase, all heroes flip the token up to the gem side. Once
a hero ends the Hero Turn, he must flip the token to the gem down side to
indicate he has already acted this Round.
Note: Ghost Soul heroes (dead heroes) must play their Hero Turn
using only the ghost soul activities detailed on their hero card
(section 11.2, page 39).

4.2.2  Enemy Turn
If there is at least one enemy in play, the active hero must draw an
Encounter card (section 15.7, page 46) from the Encounter deck to
determine what happens in the Enemy Turn.
Otherwise, if no enemies are in play, the Enemy Turn ends.
Usually, the Encounter card activates one or more enemies on the
battlefield, based on their fighting style or color rank.
Once the Encounter card is resolved and all the involved enemies have
been activated, or when there are no enemies to activate, the Enemy Turn
ends and the next Hero Turn begins.
When the last hero has completed his Enemy Turn, the Event Phase
begins.
The normal sequence of an Enemy Turn is:
If there are enemies in play, the active hero draws an Encounter
card.
♦♦ Enemies are activated according to the drawn card, using the first
condition or, when not even partially possible, the otherwise
condition. When even the second condition cannot be used,
nothing happens.
♦♦ Activated enemies perform their movement &amp; attacks (based on
their Enemy Scroll cards).
♦♦ The Encounter card is discarded into the relevant discard pile.
Note: Ghost Soul heroes (dead heroes) must skip the Enemy Turn
entirely, even if there are enemies in play.
♦♦

4.3  Event

Phase

The Event Phase is the closing phase of the Round.
Sometimes its effects may influence the game during the next Round.
As the main step of this phase, the active hero (the hero who played last in
the Battle Phase) must check the status of the top card of the Event deck:

When the first effect of a standard event is written in “BOLD TEXT,”
the event effect is ongoing. It remains active until the end of its duration,
usually the next Event Phase, when the card is discarded, or when covered
by a Story Event card.
Most Event cards include instructions to spawn new enemies through the
Spawn Gates present on the battlefield. To maintain game balance, the
number of enemies spawned depends on the number of heroes in play:

If it is unrevealed (back side of the card is visible):
He must draw the top card and resolve its effects in the exact order
in which they appear. Then, the revealed card must be placed (front
side of the card visible) on top of the Event deck.
Otherwise, if the top card is already revealed (front side of the card is
visible):
♦♦

He must simply take the revealed card and discard it into the discard
pile.
This means, unless noted otherwise, one Event card is revealed and
resolved every two rounds.
♦♦

There are 3 types of Event card:
♦♦
♦♦

♦♦

Standard Event: the effects are resolved as described on the card.
Story Event: represents a key point in the Quest. The Storybook
and the Book of Secrets describe what happens when the event is
resolved.
Night &amp; Day Events: representing the natural cycle of Night and
Day, their effects are described in the Storybook. These cards must
be immediately placed beside the Event deck when resolved,
meaning you will reveal and resolve another Event card the next
Round.

4.3.1  Story Events
During Quests, heroes may encounter Story Event cards placed directly in
an area on the map. When a hero reaches one of these cards, he triggers
it as a special activity. It interrupts, and pauses, any other game activity or
game time.
As a rule, as soon as a Story Event card is triggered (drawn from the deck
or when the hero moves into the same area), all its effects must be resolved,
in the order printed in the Book of Secrets. After event resolution,
the game resumes from where it was interrupted. For instance, a hero may
complete his Movement activity, if it was interrupted by reaching a Story
Event card, and then he may continue playing the rest of his turn.
Story Events and their effects are completely described in each Quest.

15

Usually, after resolution, the Book of Secrets requires placing the Story
Event card with the front side visible (i.e. already revealed) on top of the
Event deck.

When the first of these two events is resolved, the card must be placed
beside the Event deck and remains in play until the opposite event is drawn
and resolved.

This impacts the Quest in two ways:

The effects of the new event replaces the current one, which is discarded.

♦♦

♦♦

Give more time to the heroes to complete the Quest. By placing
the card on top of the Event deck, this card will be discarded in the
next Event Phase.
Suspend any Event ongoing effect. Any ongoing effect of the top,
revealed Event card is suspended when the Story Event is placed over
it. Once the Story Event is discarded, the ongoing effect becomes
active again, but its Enemy Spawn Formula, if any, must NOT be
resolved again.

4.3.2  Night &amp; Day Events

Each of these cards has two kinds of effects:
A main effect detailed in the Storybook. When present, this effect
usually lasts until the opposite event is drawn and resolved.
♦♦ A secondary effect that interacts with the heroes’ powers. This effect
is applied only when the card comes into play.
For example, during the Night of the first Quest, the heroes are still
weakened by the resurrection and for this reason, they inflict less damage
than usual.

Each Quest may have multiple Victory and Fail outcomes.
The ending conditions are usually driven by the Quest, revealed to heroes
by resolving Story Events and Waypoints, and end the Quest immediately
once achieved.
In any case, the Quest is considered a Fail when one of these conditions
occurs:
♦♦

The Night and Day Event cards are used during the Quest to
change from night to day and vice versa.

5.	 The Heroes
This section details the heroes and the feats used to succeed in battle.
The Core set of Sword &amp; Sorcery includes two versions of each hero, representing parallel destinies of the same person, born from past choices that
shaped the nature of their very soul. Therefore, each hero sheet side shows a hero’s different color style.
Each hero has his own Hero Sheet, with the following information:

5.1  Soul

Nature

5.2  Hero

Each Hero contains a life essence called Soul. Souls are inextricably bound
to one of the Three Gods ruling the Lands:
Aneres, the benign goddess of lawful white souls. Heroes bound to
the Goddess Aneres bring good and light to the world, and respect
the law, ignoring both profits and perils.
♦♦ Enomis, the inscrutable lord of neutral grey souls. Heroes following
the God Enomis incarnate the balance required by circumstance,
and their unpredictability is as often praised as loathed, depending
on who is judged or targeted.
♦♦ Mir, the dark master of chaotic black souls. Heroes belonging to the
God Mir consider their own gain before taking any risk or oaths;
this makes them dark, yet valuable heroes.
The soul of a hero plays three roles:

Card

Beyond displaying soul nature, each hero card defines several game
elements on each side.

♦♦

♦♦

Decision making
During Quests, there will be moments when the Active hero (i.e.
the hero playing the current turn) must make decisions influencing
events. These decisions must be aligned with his soul nature (see
Soul Nature Choice, section 2.12.1 pag. 5 of the Storybook).

♦♦

Take advantage of exclusive Gods powers
Some powers the hero will acquire in battle, or use when in Ghost
Soul Form (section 11.1, page 38), depend on the soul nature
(section 7, page 25).

♦♦

Forming the party
Before the story campaign begins, or before each standalone Quest,
players should select heroes according to the soul nature represented
by the available hero cards.

The party must be formed with only similarly aligned souls:
Law

– Neutral

– Chaos

This means Law and Chaos heroes cannot be members of the same party,
while Neutral heroes can align with either of the other two soul natures.
Once the choice has been made, take the appropriate Hero Sheets and Soul
Gems.

5.1.1  Soul Storm

{Optional Rule, Default OFF}

By activating this rule, most of the restrictions due to soul nature are
cancelled, thus:
♦♦
♦♦

♦♦

Heroes in the party may belong to any soul nature.
The Active hero may choose any decision during the soul nature
choice of a Story Event, without soul nature limitations.
Hero powers can still be acquired only by a hero with the matching
soul nature.

We suggest using this rule only when you have become familiar with
Sword &amp; Sorcery.

5.2.1  Fighting Style
In Sword &amp; Sorcery, each character, whether hero or enemy, has his own
fighting style, as indicated by one of the following runes:
Dexterity: based on agility and quick strikes.
Faith: based on might derived from the gods.
Magic: based on mystic arcane energies.
Strength: based on brute force and physical attributes.
In addition to defining the fighting style, each rune printed on a hero card
defines which items the hero can use during Quests, as detailed in section
8.1, page 29.
Note: S&S Expansion Heroes may have multiple fighting styles.

19

5.2.2  Innate Powers
Each hero card represents a unique hero, gifted with one or more
innate powers that can be used on the battlefield. Section 7, page 24 for
additional details.

5.3  Soul

Gem

The Soul gem token determines the main characteristics of the hero.

Soul Gem

5.2.3  Items Capacity
This value represents the maximum number of item cards the hero can
carry in his Inventory (i.e. placed on the left side of the hero sheet, and not
equipped).
If this number is reached, the hero must perform a drop item Free Action
(section 6.4.2, page 23) prior to picking up any other item.

5.2.4  Save Roll

1.	 Soulrank. Current Soulrank of the hero.
2.	 HP. Maximum Health Points.
3.	 Powers &amp; Talents. Number of powers and talents (talents

A Save is the roll of a single Blue die
used to determine whether some
magic, poison, trap, or other effect succeeds against the hero.

This represents the hero’s ability to avoid or resist the threat, either by
dodging a trap or resisting the effects of poison.

Each time the game requires a hero to save (usually with the words,
to achieve the result indicated on his
“Unless Save”), roll a Blue die
Hero card to successfully make a save.
Note: When the die shows more than one result on the same face,

5.2.5  Movement Points
This value represents the number of movement points the hero can
spend during his Movement activity (section 6.1, page 21).

The two sides of the gem represent the matching hero’s soul nature/class,
identified by the hero’s color.
Seven of the eight facets of the gem are used to keep track of the current
Soulrank.

5.3.1  Soulrank
The Soulrank identifies the power of the hero’s soul. At the beginning
of the first Quest, the heroes are awakened from death, but the recall spell
was simultaneously a gift and curse. Although they cannot completely
die, neither they can be completely free. The spell gives them back their
strength, while guiding them closer and closer to their goal… defeating
the Evil dominating the kingdom.
To represent this, each hero begins the first Quest at Soulrank I.
During games, he will grow stronger by killing the forces of evil, until
one day, many adventures from now, the hero regains all his past glory
represented by Soulrank VII.

Soul Points can be spent by any hero during the Time Phase to enhance
his Soulrank by one, discarding the amount indicated by this formula:

During his turn, each hero may use his Movement activity to spend his

Soulrank II must spent 2*2 = 4 Soul Points. To achieve Soulrank III he
must spend 3*3 = 9 Soul Points, etc…

♦♦

♦♦

Note: Soul Points can also be spent to resurrect a hero (section 11.3,
page 39).
The Soulrank advancement in the game must follow two rules:
It is always done one Soulrank at time.
For example, to reach Soulrank IV, a hero of Soulrank I must
achieve Soulrank II and III first. 			
This can be done during the same Time Phase or it may happen
gradually, Quest after Quest, based on the available Soul Points.
♦♦ A hero cannot enhance his Soulrank further if there is another
hero in the party with a lower Soulrank.
For example, a Soulrank III hero cannot advance to Soulrank IV
if there is a hero at Soulrank II. 					
This hero must reach Soulrank III first, to permit other heroes to
reach Soulrank IV.
It is quite common in the game the use of the term “Soulrank” to give
a numeric bonus to an item or power effect in a progressive way, such as
adding
or rolling dice. In these cases, the term Soulrank always
refers to the item or power owner and its value is added to the effect of the
item or power.
♦♦

In addition, the term “Soulrank/2” means the current Soulrank of
the hero is divided by two and rounded up (always), to provide the bonus.
So:
Soulrank
Soulrank/2

♦♦

6.1.1  Engaged In Combat
Moving into an area with one or more enemies makes the hero Engaged
in combat and he may only target and attack enemies in his area,
regardless of the range of weapons, items &amp; powers.
If an engaged hero (standing in the same area with at least one enemy
figure) wants, or is forced, to leave the area, he must accomplish it by
resolving an Evade (Free Action activity), which may trigger reaction
attacks. Some Actions/Free Actions are prohibited while engaged in
combat.

6.1.2  Evade And Reaction Attacks
Figures do not block movement, but a hero who moves through enemies is
evading them and may receive reaction attacks under these circumstances:
♦♦

I=1, II=2, III=3, IV=4, V=5, VI=6, VII=7
I and II=1, III and IV=2, V and VI=3, VII=4

Each time a hero needs to modify his Soulrank, rotate the top part of
the gem.
♦♦

♦♦

Spend one movement point for each normal area.
Move no more than one area for each movement point.
May not cross blocking or barrier sides.
Entering (not leaving) difficult terrain area costs 2 movement points.
May cross an area occupied by other heroes; he can also end his
movement in such area.
Unless special effects allow, a hero is not permitted to interrupt
Movement to perform a Combat activity and then resume
movement; however, he can spend any number of Actions and Free
Actions while moving (for example, to open doors).
If movement takes the hero over a Story Event area, movement must
be interrupted and then resumed after resolution of the event.
The hero’s body conditions (section 10.6, page 37), events, powers,
and items can modify or prevent the Movement activity.

♦♦

45° degrees (one facet) clockwise to increase the Soulrank by 1.
45° degrees counterclockwise to decrease the Soulrank by 1.
♦♦

Whenever a hero moves through, or leaves, an area with one or
more enemies, he must make an evade. That means he first receives
a reaction attack (made with a primary weapon, section 15.1, page
43) from each enemy in the current area, before moving from the
current area to the adjacent area. Once all reaction attacks are
resolved, the hero’s movement may continue, if he is able.
If, during his continued movement, a hero returns to, or enters, a
new area with enemies, reaction attacks are again triggered each
time, before leaving that area (unless the hero decides to stay there
and ends his movement).
The only exception is when the heroes are dominating the
current area. In this case, no reaction attacks are allowed by
enemies in that area, regardless of their number.

21

Hero and enemy powers may modify these circumstances.

6.1.3  Flying

An enemy moving through an area containing heroes does not trigger
evade or reaction attacks.
Note: evading is considered a Free Action

6.2  Combat
The Sword &amp; Sorcery Combat System is based on two kinds of Custom
D10 Dice.

S&amp;S Custom Dice
Red Attack Die.
Blue Attack/Defence Die.
Each face of the die may contain up to two results.

Dice Face
A successful hit.
Shae (Hidden), Ecarus, Thorgar, and Fenrir are in the same area
with a Gremlin and a Raider. Since they number twice their
enemies, Shae can evade and move away without triggering
reaction attacks. Shae loses her Hiding token before movement,
because evade breaks hiding (as any other activity).

An effect related to an ability of the owner.
A trigger for some magical properties of an item.

activity to perform
During his turn, a hero can spend one Combat
an attack with an equipped primary one handed
, two handed
,
or secondary
weapon against a target within the weapon’s range.
Any weapon with 0 can only hit targets in the attacker’s area, which is
considered a Melee attack.

After the Enemy Turn, the same heroes are in the same area.
This time, if Ecarus wants to leave the area, he triggers reaction
attacks from both enemies in the area before moving. In both
cases, enemies could move away from the area without triggering
any reaction attack from the heroes.

22

Any weapon with 1 or more can hit targets in the attacker’s area or
in any other area in L.O.S. within the weapon’s range, which is always
considered a Ranged attack.

6.3  Action
A hero may spend the Action activity
anytime during his turn,
including in the middle of other activities (unless otherwise prohibited), to
perform one of these operations:
Dash: to move further than the maximum movement normally
allows.
♦♦ Bash a Chest or a Locked Door: to discover what lies behind the
lock.
♦♦ Focus an Attack: enhance the damage of the strike.
♦♦ Reorganize Equipped Items: rearrange equipped weapons, armor,
and artifacts.
♦♦ Exchange an Item: pass or receive an item to/from another hero.
♦♦ Search: seek treasures and sometimes, Quest items.
♦♦ Provoke a Master Enemy: try to attract its attention.
♦♦ Perform Quest Actions: as detailed by each Quest.
It is quite common for a high Soulrank hero to have more than one
.
♦♦

For example passing a “primary weapon only” card to a hero who already
has one equipped, forces him to place the received weapon into inventory.
During his turn, the hero may use the Reorganize Equipped Items Action
to swap the weapons.

6.3.6  Search
To use this Action, the hero must be in the same area with a Search
Area token (section 3.3, page 10), and must not be engaged in combat.
and apply the result
While searching, flip the token, roll a Red die
indicated by the token. Any other die result means nothing has been
found. When finished, remove the Search Area token from the map,
because it is not possible to search more than once per token.

6.3.7  Provoke A Master Enemy
While fighting a Master Enemy, each hero, once per Round, can spend
one Action to modify the status of the Menace token, as detailed in section
16.1, page 54.

can be used to perform a different operation or the
In this case, each
same operation multiple times (unless prohibited in the next sections).

6.3.1  Dash

A Free Action activity
represents a very quick operation executed by a
hero during his turn, such as:

With a Dash action, the hero can stand after a K.O. (section 10.6.1, page
37) OR increase his movement points by 1 during his Movement activity.
In both cases, a hero cannot use Dash more than once per Round.

6.3.2  Bash A Chest Or A Locked Door
A hero not engaged in combat, in front of a chest or a locked door, can
bash and open it by spending the Action. Once done, draw a trap card.
Section 3.3.1, page 11 for information related to doors, chests and traps.

6.3.3  Focus An Attack

Actions

Opening standard doors.
♦♦ Pick Up/Drop an item.
♦♦ Evade.
Like the standard Action activity, it can be used anytime during the hero’s
turn, including the middle of other activities (unless otherwise prohibited).
Free Actions are not limited; a hero may perform any number of Free
Action activities during his turn.
♦♦

Note: The
is not represented on the soul gem due to its
unlimited use.

A hero, once per Round, can spend one, and only one, Action to enhance
one of his attacks (before rolling HIT Dice) coming from any item or
power, adding +1
.

6.4.1  Open Normal Doors

6.3.4  Reorganize Equipped Items

Once done, draw a Trap card. Section 3.3.1, page 11 for information
related to doors and traps.

With this action, a hero not engaged in combat may rearrange any
number of equipped weapons, armor, and artifacts with those stored in
his inventory. Moving a weapon from the primary weapon slot
to
the secondary weapon slot
and vice versa (respecting the weapon
suitability) is a part of this action.

6.3.5  Exchange An Item
With this Action, a hero not engaged in combat may pass/receive up
to one item and any number of Crowns to/from another hero in the
same area. If the item can be equipped (weapon, armor, or artifact), the
hero receiving the item can directly equip it, if his relative slot is empty;
otherwise, the received item must be placed into inventory.

A hero in front of a standard non-locked door can simply open it (i.e.
remove the door token from play) by spending a Free Action.

6.4.2  Pick Up/Drop An Item
As a Free Action, a hero not engaged in combat may drop any number
of items, both equipped or from inventory, and any number of Crowns
on the ground in his area (i.e. place the relative cards/tokens on the map).
In the same way, a hero can pick up any amount of loot (section 15.12.1,
page 52), items, and Crowns from his area.
All items picked up must be placed into inventory, even if the relative
slot is empty. Once complete, the hero may decide to spend a Reorganize
Equipped Items Action to equip them.

23

6.4.3  Evade
Evade happens each time a hero want to move out of an area containing
enemies (not into an area!), section 6.1.2 page 21.

7.	 Powers
Powers are extremely potent hero abilities and spells.

6.5  Activation

Activities

In addition to activities described in previous sections, hero activities can
be used to activate items and powers cards, when they have one of these
icons:
Passive. Based on the text, the effect is always active or can be
activated anytime by the hero, without requiring an activity.
Movement. The effect can be activated by forfeiting the hero’s
entire Movement activity.
Combat. The effect can be activated by forfeiting one Combat
activity.

There are three types of powers in Sword &amp; Sorcery:
Innate Powers. One or more special abilities printed on each Hero
card.
♦♦ Standard Powers. A deck of cards representing physical and
magical abilities dedicated to each hero. Some cards may be related
to a specific soul nature.
♦♦ Talent Powers. A deck of cards representing generic abilities any
hero can acquire when the soul gem shows the “*” symbol near the
number related to the powers.
Each hero begins his adventure with at least one innate power and a
number of powers indicated by the soul gem, based on Soulrank.
♦♦

Action. The effect can be activated by forfeiting one Action
activity.
Free. The effect can be activated anytime during the hero’s turn,
spending one Free Action activity.
Reaction. The effect can be activated anytime outside the
hero’s turn, without requiring an activity.
Follow these guidelines:
♦♦

♦♦

The terms “Soulrank” and “Soulrank/2” always refer to the
item or power owner.
An item or power without range can only be used by the owner on
himself.

An item or power with the range icon
can only be used if there
is L.O.S. with the target.
♦♦ If an item or power effect refers to “next attack, movement, etc…,”
the effect must be accomplished before the end of the turn. This
means, unless explicitly stated, it is not possible for an activated
effect to last beyond the current turn.
♦♦ The phrase “until Time Phase” always refers to the next Time Phase.
♦♦ Limitations such as "once per Round" or "once per Quest" cannot
be bypassed in any way.
Note: Other limitations regarding usage and duration can be present
on items &amp; powers cards.

A hero can activate his powers spending the required activity (section

cards have minimum Soulrank Level (the first Roman Number on the
left side) required to acquire and use that power. Some allow the power
to become stronger by using a higher Soulrank Level. As the character
gains more Soulranks, the player may choose a higher Soulrank Level
of the Power card as long as the selected level of the Power is equal to or
lower than the current Soulrank of the hero. If so, simply read the base
effect of the power and then add the additional effects/values of the
chosen level (as explained in the following examples).

7.2  Companions
Some heroes may acquire powers to summon a companion, a valuable ally
who fights together with its owner, such as Fenrir the wolf for Laegon.
In game terms, summoning a companion means using the summoning
Power card, taking the relative Companion card, and placing its figure in
the owner’s area.							
The Power card establishes the summoning conditions, such as the activity
required to summon and activate the companion, the rules to manage
it and how the companion can be summoned again upon death, etc…
In the first turn, the hero must spend the indicated activity to summon
the companion and then immediately activate it. Once summoned, in
subsequent turns, the hero can use the same activity to activate the
companion, no more than once per Round. 				
The power cooldown works slightly differently from standard cooldown.
Instead of starting when the power is used, it usually starts when the
companion dies. When this happens, flip the Power card to the matching
hourglass’s side and manage cooldown as usual.				
The Companion card represents all of the companion’s characteristics, like
an all-in-one hero sheet, plus all its item &amp; Power cards. Once activated,
the companion can move using its movement points, perform an attack
with its weapon, and use its innate power. Companions follow these rules:
♦♦

A companion does not have its own Hero Turn; it can only be

Does not count as a hero in play during Events unless the
Hero Count indicates 1 or more, if so, it counts as much as the
indicated value. If the Hero Count is not present, it counts as 0.

It counts as a hero for controlling/dominating an area.

8.	Items

8.2  Equipment

Weapons are one of the main item resources to prevail in battle!

The Item cards heroes find and use to fight the evil forces are divided into
two categories:

Weapon Card

Many standard items can be purchased visiting the Emporium (section 14,
page 41), while the most powerful and magical items can only be found
as treasures during Quests. Each time a hero gains an item, place it on the
ground (in its area) if the hero’s inventory is full.
Not all items can be used by every hero. Items must be compatible with
the hero’s fighting style.

Style Compatibility

Each item card has one or two runes beside the name to indicate which
hero fighting style can use/equip it:

Consumable

This rune indicates any hero can use
the item.

Battle Axe

This rune indicates only a hero with
this fighting style
can use the item.

A hero without equipped weapons can attack with his bare hands.

Armors offer protection from enemy attacks!

Note: If the soul weapon is no longer present in the hero’s
weapon slot, either because it is dropped or placed in inventory, it
immediately returns on the front side.

Weapons from the Emporium and Stash decks can be forged at the
Enchanting Anvil (section 14.3.1, page 41) to make them stronger.
Note: The weapon category is sometime used by Powers to trigger
additional effects.

8.2.1  Soul Weapons
The most powerful weapons of the kingdom are called soul weapons and
are part of the legendary tales known to most commoners.
A hero wielding one of these is destined to become a legend, but he also

As described in the Combat section, magic shield tokens must be
discarded (mandatory) to cancel hits while defending during the step

Note: Other magical items, in addition to armor, can generate magic
shields. In such cases all magic shields are used together as a single
pool.

8.4  Equipment

Note: Some items may grant additional Powers to heroes. These
Powers must be acquired using standard rules and are available only
when the items are equipped.
Some artifacts have an energy charge represented by this token:

9.	Combat System

♦♦

The S&amp;S Combat System is used to manage any attack performed by
heroes and enemies, and is formed by two Stages:
♦♦

DEF: Represents the attempt to avoid a successful hit and
is divided into as many as 6 steps, based on the defender’s
characteristics:
❖❖ Step 1 – Weaknesses and Resistances: Most enemies have
weaknesses and resistances against particular damage types,
which can modify the total number of
.

HIT: represents the attempt to hit the target. It is divided into 3

steps:
❖❖ Step 1 – Rolling HIT Dice: As the first step, the attacker
selects his target and chosen weapon, power, or item, applying its
attack values and rolling dice as follow:

For Example a Slash sword weapon
against a Blue Gremlin reduces the
total
by 1.
❖❖

: number of certain hits.
: number of Red Dice to roll.
: number of Blue Dice to roll.
❖❖

Step 2 – Applying Effects: As the second step, once all dice
are rolled, the attacker may spend any dice result to activate the
matching result’s effect, such as:

-

Having an armor value of 2 means,
unless K.O.ed, remove the first 2
from any incoming attack before
proceeding with the next step.
❖❖

Step 3 – Magic shields: If magic shields
protect the defender,
first cancel hits by removing one point of magic shield for each
. Magic shields are usually refreshed during the next Time
Phase.
Having 2 magic shields means
discarding one magic shield token
(if any) for each
removed
from the incoming attack before
proceeding with the next step.

❖❖

Step 4 – Rolling DEF Dice: The defender rolls 1 Blue die
for each remaining
up to the defence value indicated.
Note: When the defence value is not present, no defense dice
are rolled.

Following these guidelines:
❖❖ Using an effect is optional (unless directly specified) and if
done, it cannot be activated more than once.
❖❖

32

If the same effect is present multiple times on items &amp; powers,
it must be activated separately and no more than once each.

❖❖

A die cannot be rerolled more than once.

❖❖

Each single result cannot be spent more than once.

❖❖

The
result of the Red dice can be spent as a single
or as two separate
to activate two different effects.

❖❖

All effects are applied in activation order, before the DEF
stage begins.

❖❖

Unless stated otherwise, an effect ends at the end of the
attack. For example, if the attacker activates
:-1
it is valid only for this attack.

Step 2 – Armor: The defender may have armor
that
protects him. If so, the armor value must be subtracted from the
total
. If the defender is K.O.ed (section 10.6.1, page 37),
ignore the armor value.
Note: When the armor value is not present, nothing is
subtracted from the total.

Having a defense value of 2
means rolling 1 Blue die when
defending against 1
and 2 Blue
dice against 2
or more.
Step 5 – Applying effects: Once all dice are rolled, the defender
may spend any dice result to activate the matching armor’s
effect to further reduce the number of
, following the same
guidelines from step 2 of the HIT stage.
❖❖ Step 6 – Summarize Shields: Finally, calculate the total number
of
after any other item &amp; power effects are used.One
result. Once this last
is cancelled for each successful shield
step is ended, the defender can no longer modify the results and
suffers 1 HP for each remaining
result.
Items &amp; powers can be used by the attacker, during the HIT stage, and by
the defender, during the DEF stage, during each step, as long as the effect
is appropriate for the current step. For example, an effect adding more dice
to a roll must be used in the “Rolling HIT/DEF Dice” step, while a
❖❖

,	

❖❖

Subsequent attacks must reactivate an effect to use it.

❖❖

Extra attacks are performed once the current one is resolved.

❖❖

For the description of special game effects, section 10, page 35.

❖❖

Step 3 – Summarize Hits: As the third and final step, the
total number of
obtained is calculated after any other
item &amp; power effects are used. Once this last step is ended,
the attacker can no longer modify the results and the attack
passes to the DEF stage.

reroll effect or an effect changing the meaning of dice results must be used
in the “Applying Effects” step. Similarly, an effect adding
or
must be used in the “Summarize Hits/Shields” step.

Note: "Combat activity" and "Attack" are two different concepts.
The Combat activity is like a "coin" that can be spent to initiate a
weapon attack, or use an Item, or use a power requiring a Combat
as "fuel" (See Activation Activities, section 6.5, page 24). An
attack is performed by the HIT and DEF stages, using any Item or
Power having a Damage Type: Slash, Pierce, Blunt, or Arcane
and follows the Combat System rules explained above.

Ecarus attacks a Green Raider with his Shield; he rolls 1

the Blue die, which is cancelled by the Raider’s armor value.
However, Ecarus uses his shield’s effect “Bash” to move the

against a target is considered
Note: Any item or power that deals
an attack and can be defended as usual.
When the damage type is present: Arcane - Blunt - Pierce - Slash,
it is considered an attack and must be compared against enemy weaknesses
and resistances.
The term “All” indicates a resistance/weakness against any kind of damage
type, while “All but Slash” for instance, means a resistance/weakness
against all damage types except Slash.

9.1  Supremacy
All attacks performed by a faction (heroes or enemies) against a target who
resides in an area dominated (section 3.1, page 9) by the attacking faction
inflict +1
.
The check to determine control or domination of an area must be
done at the beginning of each Hit Stage, this means that any effect
(for instance K.O.) activated during the attack will not affect the current
supremacy bonus.

Supremacy Example

Attack Example

Shae the assassin wields a “Forged” Dirk as her primary weapon
and a Greedy Sting as her secondary weapon
.
She decides to use her Combat activity to perform an attack with
the dirk against a Green Orc Shaman with 2 HP remaining, but
with both of his magic shields active.
Shae rolls two

, activating the Lethal I effect.

The Orc Shaman has no armor value to absorb the hits, so he
must use the magic shields to cancel both hits, even though one
is Lethal I; the magic shields are discarded, and will regenerate
in the next Time Phase. Now, Shae uses her innate power to
attack again with the secondary weapon (as she is wielding two
Daggers). In addition, she spends one of her Action activities to

Focus the attack, thus adding a
death of the Shaman, regardless of the dice rolled, because 2 hits
are enough.

34

Laegon spends one Action
to activate Fenrir and move him
into the area where the heroes are fighting. Fenrir attacks the
Raider with the Supremacy bonus, because the heroes now have
at least twice the number of the enemies. Laegon then attacks
the Raider with his Longbow, getting the Supremacy bonus,
since he is attacking an enemy in an area dominated by the
heroes.

10.	Special Game Effects
Sword &amp; Sorcery items &amp; powers are able to create incredible and
devastating effects. Each is detailed in the next sections.

10.1  Critical
Critical hits are particularly powerful hits caused by the extreme

efficiency of certain weapons, items &amp; powers. During the setup of each
Quest (and each time the pile is empty), gather all Critical tokens and
shuffle them face down into a pile (or a bag).
Each time an attack with a Critical effect is performed with a weapon,
, before any other effect is

applied, draw a Critical token from the pile/bag and place it on the
defender card.
, the Critical is
This means, if the attacker obtains at least one
applied before the defender can block it by rolling dice.
The only way for the defender to avoid the critical is to completely ignore
the attack by using some special items &amp; powers.

Green

Blue

Red

The front side of a critical token determines two factors:
Effect: Critical effects may impact the target in different ways, such
as wounding, decreasing the armor value or the maximum HP,
stunning, etc…
♦♦ Duration: the color background of the token indicates the duration
of the critical effect. There are three different durations:
♦♦ Green represents an instant Critical. The effect is applied and the
Critical token is immediately discarded to the relative discard pile.
♦♦ Blue represents a temporary body condition. The effect is applied,
placing the matching body condition token on the defender’s card
and discarding the Critical token into the relative discard pile.
♦♦ Red represents a permanent body condition. The effect is applied,
placing the Critical token on the defender’s card. It remains there
until the end of the Quest, until removed (as a body condition),
or until the target dies. In the last two cases, once discarded, place
the token into the relative discard pile.
The same target cannot have the same Critical effect twice. If this
happens, the newest effect is discarded and the target suffers 1 wound.
However, a greater effect of the same type always replaces a lesser one
(without causing additional wounds to the target).
♦♦

-2

(Red critical), the -2

(Red critical) and suffers

remains and the -1

is discarded to

the relative discard pile.

10.2  Bash
The Bash effect forces the defender of an attack to move back 1 area
from the current position. If the Bash effect is related to an attack, it works
only if the attack obtains at least 1
. The attack is resolved normally
even if the defender is no longer in the same area of the attacker (due to
the Bash). “Move back” means moving in the direction where the defender
came from. When this is not possible, the defender (or controlling player,
in case of an enemy) decides where to move.
The Bash is applied even if the defender can’t move due to a body
condition or other effect.
Note: When a hero is moved due to a Bash effect, he avoids any
reaction attack from the enemies in the area from where he came.

10.3  Fire
The Fire effect is represented by the Fire token.
The two sides of the token are used to keep track of the effect duration:

Critical
Back Side

For example, if a target already has -1

Fire I means it is discarded
during the next Time
Phase, after dealing 1 HP
to the character with the
effect.

Fire II means, in the next
Time Phase, it is flipped
to the Fire I side after
dealing 1 HP to the
character with the effect.

When a character suffers a Fire I or Fire II effect, he must place one fire
token of the matching side on his card, even if a Fire token is already
present.
When a Fire token is placed in an area, all characters in that area
immediately suffer the same Fire effect.
Fire can also be present as a standalone token in one or more areas of the
map. In this case, each character moving into those areas immediately
suffers the same Fire effect (i.e. taking the relative Fire token).
The Fire token on the map remains until discarded during the relative
Time Phase; it is flipped/discarded just like Fire on a character, even if it
does not damage anyone with its effect.

10.4  AoE
The term AoE means Areas of Effect. It allows an attack or effect to affect
not only the primary target, but all other targets of the same faction
(heroes or enemies) in the same area, and adjacent areas (connected by a
legal movement path, regardless the L.O.S.), depending on the numeric
range following the AoE.

35

In all cases, the attacker rolls the dice only once, while each defender
defends separately, but simultaneously.
Note: AoE is also applied to healing and other effects using the same
rules.

AoE{0} Example

10.5  Lethal
The Lethal effect gives an unstoppable force to the

of an attack.

This effect can be related to all hits of the attack with the word “Lethal”
, such as: Lethal I, II, or V. In these
or only to a certain number of
cases, only the given number of hits are considered Lethal. The remaining
hits are normal. This means the Lethal effect works only if the attacker
obtains at least 1
.
When an attack includes Lethal hits, they should be resolved before
skips steps 2 and 4 of the DEF stage,
normal hits. Each Lethal

Normal shield results
cannot cancel Lethal hits.
The only useful defenses against this type of attack are:
Magic Shields
, which absorb Lethal
as usual (DEF Step 3).
♦♦ Resistances, and items &amp; powers, which may modify the total
number of
of the attack.
This means each Lethal
not canceled/reduced by resistances, magic
shields,	 and items &amp; powers during the DEF stage deals one damage to
the defender’s Health Points.
♦♦

The attack hits the original target and all other targets in the
same area with the same number of
and additional effects.

Lethal I Example

both armor and defense values, so the brave Ranger kills the

The attack hits the original target, all targets in the same area,
and any other targets within one area, connected by a legal
movement path (regardless the L.O.S.), with the same number of
and additional effects.

36

Lethal II Example

10.6.1  Knocked Out {K.O.}
A K.O.ed hero has limited capabilities. While suffering this condition, he
must follow these rules:
♦♦

He cannot perform

activities.

He must ignore the armor value
of his armor card.
♦♦ He counts as 0 figures for controlling/dominating his area.
♦♦ To move, he must first remove the K.O. condition, either by using a
Dash Action or one movement point of his Movement activity.
♦♦ Once the K.O. condition is removed, the hero can continue
normally.
A K.O.ed hero is represented on the map by laying the relevant figure
on its side. Stand the figure up, once the condition is removed.
♦♦

Shae attacks a Red Orc Warrior with her Crystal Knife.

10.6.2  Permanent Criticals

effect, thus inflicting 4 hits, 2 of which are Lethal.

A permanent (Red) Critical affects the character until the end of the
Quest, until removed (as a body condition), or until the target dies.

The Orc cannot avoid the 2 Lethal hits, because Lethal hits
ignore both armor and defense values; however, he blocks the
two “normal” hits with his armor.

Permanent Red Critical Tokens
Any attack performed by the character causes -1

10.6  Body

.

Conditions

Body Conditions are particular effects that impact the hero in different
ways, such as:
Knock Out (K.O.)
Permanent (Red) Critical
♦♦ Poison
♦♦ Blind
♦♦ Slow
♦♦ Stun
When a hero suffers a body condition, place the matching token on the
hero card and apply the effects detailed in the next sections.

The armor value of the character is reduced by 1.

♦♦
♦♦

Reduce the character’s maximum number of HP
by 1 or 2. This critical can kill the character if his
wounds equal his new HP.

The character cannot use

effects of items &amp; powers.

A character can suffer more than one body condition at the same
time, but cannot suffer the same condition twice. If this happens, the
second condition is discarded and the character immediately suffers 1
wound.
Body conditions can be removed (i.e. discarded) with many different items
&amp; powers, such as the Bandages and Small Bandages consumable
items.
Note: Body conditions may work differently on enemies (section
15.11 page 51.)

37

10.6.3  Poisoned
When a hero suffers a Poison I or II effect, he becomes
poisoned and immediately places a Poison I or II token
matching his condition on his Hero card.
While the Poison condition lasts, he must do the
following in each Time Phase:
First, suffer an amount of wounds equal to the Poison effect (1 or 2).
Then, attempt a Save roll. If the Save is successful (see Save roll,
page 20), discard the Poison token.
If a hero already has “Poison I” and suffers a “Poison II” effect,
the “Poison I” token is flipped to the “Poison II” side and the hero
immediately suffers 1 wound.
♦♦

♦♦

10.6.4  Blinded
A Blinded hero must attempt a Save roll before any activity.
If it succeeds, the activity can be performed normally, otherwise
it fails, wasting the activity with no further effects.
Discard the Blinded token at the end of his next Hero Turn.

10.6.5  Slowed

11.	Health
The Heart Gem icon indicates Health Points (HP).
The number written inside or near the icon represents the
amount of damage this hero can withstand before being killed.
This number can be changed by the effects of critical attacks and items &amp;
powers.
To keep track of current health, when a hero is wounded, place
the appropriate number of wounds (using the numbered Wound
tokens) on the hero card.
If the total number of wounds equal or exceeds the hero’s HP, he dies,
becoming a Ghost Soul hero.

11.1  Death

When a hero dies, he becomes ethereal and his soul becomes weaker. In
game terms, he loses one Soulrank. When this happens, immediately
apply the following.
♦♦

While Slowed, a hero can only perform Free Action activities
and only one of these, regardless of the numbers on the soul
gem:
1

While in Ghost Soul Form, you may only

10.6.6  Stunned

Discard the Stunned token at the end of his next Hero Turn.

Heal 2 HP

Recall

Move 5

Discard any body condition, modifier, and effect tokens.
♦♦ Discard all the Power cards related to the lost Soulrank.
♦♦ Drop all Item cards in inventory (including Crowns and Quest
tokens, but not equipped items).
From this moment and until resurrection, the hero acts as a Ghost Soul,
following these rules:
♦♦

♦♦
♦♦

♦♦

38

Reduce the current Soulrank by 1, to a minimum of 1 (the
minimum Soulrank may vary for some Quests).
Flip the hero card to the Ghost Soul Form side.
Ghost Soul Form

Discard the Slowed token at the end of his next Hero Turn.

A Stunned hero must skip his entire Hero Turn, forfeiting any
kind of activity, including using reaction items &amp; powers,
although passive powers still work.

{Becoming A Ghost Soul}

Play his Hero Turns using only ghost soul activities.
He never counts as a hero in play, including for controlling/
dominating an area or for the spawn formula of the Event Phase
(except when the formula indicates just “heroes” instead of “heroes
in play.” In that case, the Ghost Soul hero still counts as hero).
Ignore any Item &amp; Power cards, unless explicitly indicated.

His Power cards continue to rotate and refresh during the Time
Phase.
♦♦ Skip his Enemy Turn, even if there are enemies in play. He must
play his assigned enemies, however, if activated during other Enemy
Turns.
♦♦ Unless explicitly stated, he cannot be targeted by hero items &amp;
powers.
♦♦ He is completely ignored by enemies and traps. He cannot be
targeted and does not suffer damage from them.
♦♦ Ignore any special game effect.
If a Quest ends while a hero is in a Ghost Soul Form, that hero
must permanently discard one of his equipped cards, selected at
random. This means gather all equipped cards, and then randomly pick
one. The discarded card returns to the relative deck.
♦♦

Note: Unless explicitly stated, if at any moment all heroes are
ghost souls, the Quest immediately fails.

Hero’s Death Example

Thorgar, currently Soulrank III, suffers his last wound.
His player must now update the character sheet:

Soul Activities

While in Ghost Soul Form, during his turn, a hero is limited to these
three activities, which can be performed once each, in any order:
♦♦
♦♦

Recall: place the ghost soul hero in the same area as an active Shrine.
When more than one Shrine is present, the hero may choose.
Move: move using the same flying movement rules of the heroes
(section 6.1.3, page 22). While moving as a ghost soul, he can’t
interact with the world, so he can’t open doors, chests, trigger
events, or reveal Shadows.

12.	Miscellaneous Items

During each Time Phase, a ghost soul hero in the same area as an active
Shrine can spend Soul Points to return to life.

Potions, tools, and scrolls are the hero’s best friends!

Gods Shrine
Active Shrine

Inactive Shrine

Miscellaneous items must be placed in the inventory slot of the hero sheet,
keeping the cards side-by-side starting from right to left, until the hero’s
capacity is reached:

A Shrine can be activated and deactivated by Quest rules.
The number of Soul Points needed to resurrect a hero is equal to
the current Soulrank of the hero. For example, a ghost soul hero of
Soulrank III must spend 3 Soul Points to resurrect.

Their effects are used directly from inventory, spending the required
activity as needed.

When resurrected, flip the hero card and return to full health state.
Beginning immediately, the hero can play his Hero Turn normally.

Miscellaneous items are divided into 3 categories to indicate the number of
times they can be used, and if and when to discard them.

ACT I

Coins are personal property, not a shared resource of the party.
They can be picked up, dropped, or transferred from one hero to another
with a “Exchange an item” action. In addition, while heroes are visiting
the Emporium, they can be transferred between heroes as a gift or loan, as
desired.

14.	Emporium
The Emporium represents any vendor or shop spread across the kingdom,
which heroes could visit to acquire new equipment.
In game terms, all item cards with the Emporium cost
printed in the lower right corner of the front side are identified
as the “Emporium” deck. When the game indicates the Heroes “visit” the
Emporium (usually before the Quest begins, unless specified in the Quest
special rules), it means, pause the game, take the Emporium deck, and
allow each hero to spend his Crowns, to purchase new cards.
Most of the Emporium
cards are double sided.

For example, a hero who
buys “Knives” and wants to upgrade them to “Elven Knives” (on the back
side), must pay the entire cost for Elven Knives when visiting the
Emporium. Some cards may have different requirements on the two sides.
Purchased cards can be immediately equipped (if the requirements are
met), or placed in the inventory of any hero, because, while visiting the
Emporium, any hero can rearrange and exchange items without spending
activities.

Healing Elixir

Note: Only heroes visiting the Emporium can acquire and exchange
items. When a game effect keeps a hero outside the shop, he cannot
interact with the shop or other heroes.

heroes always have appropriate equipment available, although less
powerful than equipment obtained using Crowns or Treasure.

2. In Campaign mode, it may also contain other Item cards left by
the heroes. These cards remain until used by the heroes. This allows
heroes to deposit an item, if this is not useful during the upcoming
Quest, or simply to avoid taking up inventory space.

deck, use the mobile App or the printable material, both downloadable
from the Sword &amp; Sorcery website. {www.sword-and-sorcery.com}
14.3  Buildings
As a part of the Emporium deck there are also special cards called
Buildings, these cards never leave the deck and offer different services
that heroes can buy.

14.3.1  Enchanting Anvil
The Enchanting Anvil card represents one of the most skilled blacksmiths
of the kingdom!
Any hero visiting the Emporium can spend 50

enhance its characteristics. Once done, flip the
side. The card remains in its

15.	The Enemies

15.1  Enemy

The Enemy faction represents the evil forces fought by the heroes.
An enemy can have different behaviors, weapons, and powers.
These combinations are identified by three color-coded Ranks.
Green: lowest rank, represents standard enemy troops.
♦♦ Blue: advanced rank, represents a more powerful veteran enemy.
♦♦ Red: elite rank, represents an elite enemy. It is usually extremely
dangerous.
The game contains multiple copies of the three ranks for each enemy:
♦♦

Each Enemy Scroll card represents the behavior of an enemy and has
several major sections, detailing the enemy’s movement, powers, and
combat weapons.
The Enemy Scroll works as a behavior template shared for all copies of
the same enemy with the same Rank. It is used mainly during enemy
activation. All the scrolls are placed in the game area when the Quest
begins and remain there, even when there are no enemies in play, because
what uniquely identifies each Enemy is the Enemy card, not these scrolls.
Note: Some scrolls are printed on both sides to represent different
enemies or fighting stances sharing the same figure.

2x Green Rank, 2x Blue Rank, and 1x Red Rank.

In addition, heroes may encounter unique, legendary foes of Master rank,
the highest rank of the game, represented by Purple enemies (section 16,
page 53).

enemy. This card contains the HP, defense values, enemy powers,
and, ultimately, loot.

occasionally used to activate the enemy or to provide a special power
or benefit.
Fighting Style &amp; Challenge Level: enemy fighting style is used to
determine its activation (section 15.7, page 46). The Challenge Level
is represented by 1 to 4 small diamonds around the rune and is not
used during the game. It allows enemies to be swapped with new
ones from future S&amp;S expansions. If the Rank and the Fighting
Style match, the enemy may be swapped based on the desired

Note: When the secondary weapon name is not present, all
effects indicated are part of the primary weapon.

15.2  Enemy

card

An Enemy card represents a single enemy in play and has several sections
detailing the enemy’s HP, defense values, resistances, weaknesses, and loot.
During the game, Enemy cards are drawn by a player when required by
the Quest (usually with the terms Spawn or Place) or when a Shadow is
revealed (section 15.4, page 44). Each Enemy card drawn is assigned to a
player (see the “Enemy Assignment” section 15.6, page 46), then used in
combination with the figure and Enemy Scroll to represent the enemy on
the battlefield. Players who are assigned an Enemy card must read it, along
with the matching Enemy Scroll card, to play the enemy at its best ability.

15.2.1  Horde Enemies
Some enemies, like the Gremlins Pack, have the
“Horde” power.
This means a single Enemy card represents a group of two or more figures,
each with its own HP. They must be targeted and defended individually,
but counted as a single enemy on the battlefield in terms or activations
and Event

Power card
Many enemies use these cards.
When present, they are indicated with one 	
or more
icons located in the upper left
section of the Enemy cards.

Enemies may also gain enemy powers due to some Shadows (section 15.4,
page 44) or by killing heroes (section 15.3.1, page 44)! Each time an
enemy with these powers enters play, draw cards from the enemy powers
deck based on the number of icons shown in the relevant Enemy card. 	
In case of multiple Power cards, the enemy cannot have more than two
Enemy Power cards assigned and no more than one card per Type. 	
If needed, after the first, draw and discard the new Power card until they
are all different types. Once drawn, place Power cards near the Enemy
card, they become part of the enemy until it dies. Each Power card has two
levels (rotated 180°), the level of the power to use is based on the Quest
ACT. For example, all Quests from Immortal Souls are ACT I. For this
reason, Level I powers are used unless indicated differently.
Note: it is possible for an acquired power to have a similar or equal
effect to a power already owned by the enemy. In this case, simply
apply the Enemy Scroll’s effect first, and then apply the Enemy
Power card effects.

15.3.1  Killing Heroes
When any Green or Blue Rank enemy with less than two assigned
kills a hero or a companion, it immediately gains a random Enemy Power
card. The level of the power is based on the Quest ACT. When it dies, all
Enemy Power cards are discarded normally.

15.4  Shadows
During Quests, our heroes will fight against enemies
lurking in Shadows.
In game terms, these enemies are represented by Shadow
tokens.
Typically, Shadow tokens are placed on the map during Quest setup.
Their number varies based on the number of heroes.
Unless indicated, they don’t move and do not block L.O.S.

A Shadow must be immediately revealed when it enters a hero’s L.O.S.
Shadows revelation always has the highest priority in ANY game phase
and must be done as soon as possible (even before Event resolution) for all
Shadows in L.O.S. at the same time. When it occurs, the Active hero
must pause his current activity. For instance, when the hero moves, the
L.O.S. check must be done after every single movement, area by area. If
the hero has visual contact with a Shadow, it is revealed immediately and
then the hero resumes his movement.
When revealed, the Shadow token is flipped up to determine what happens,
according to the following table:

Male Citizen Represents a male citizen, not an enemy.
Simply discard it. Sometimes it also indicates a vendor
or an ally, based on Quest special rules.

Female Citizen Represents a female citizen, not an enemy.
Simply discard it. Sometimes it also indicates a vendor
or an ally, based on Quest special rules.

Enemy

During the setup of each Quest, a Shadow Reserve is created by shuffling
the indicated number of Shadow tokens (face down), as specified by the
Quest briefing. This will generate the pool of Shadows usable for the
Quest, usually containing more Shadows than needed to set up the Quest.
The number of initial Shadows on the map is based on the number of
heroes. The number written over each Shadow in the Quest Setup indicates
the minimum number of heroes required to place it.
Note: When the Shadow Reserve is empty and a Shadow needs to
be placed onto the map, replenish the reserve by shuffling all the
Shadow tokens in the discard pile and placing them back in the
reserve.

15.5  Spawn

Gates

In addition to Shadows, other enemies can enter the battlefield from
Spawn Gates. Each Spawn Gate is located inside an area and can be either
open or closed, based on which side is visible.

Spawn Gate Tokens
Closed Spawn Gates

Open Spawn Gates

Represents an enemy.
Discard and replace it with the first enemy from the

Enemy deck and immediately draw an Enemy Power
card for it, even if the enemy drawn already has it own
Enemy Power. Ignore the additional Power if it already
has two.

2 Enemies

Represents two enemies.
Discard and replace it with the first and the second
enemies from the Enemy deck.

Quest Enemy Represents a Quest enemy.
Discard and replace it with the enemy indicated by the
Storybook or the Book of Secrets.
Note: This Shadow becomes part of the
reserve only when directly indicated.	

Quest

Represents a Key moment in the Quest.
Discard and follow the rules indicated by the
Storybook or the Book of Secrets.
Note: This Shadow becomes part of the
reserve only when expressly indicated.

Each Quest provides instructions if and when to change the state of a
Spawn Gate.

45

In game terms, each time the game requires an enemy to Spawn onto the
map:
If there is more than one open Spawn Gate on the map, the Active
player rolls 1 Blue die
to determine the open Spawn Gate used,
matching the die result with the Spawn Gate icon. Otherwise, the
single open Spawn Gate is used.
♦♦ Draw the top Enemy card from the Enemy deck and assign it,
following the rules detailed in the next section.
♦♦ Place the enemy figure in the Spawn Gate area.
If the symbol rolled is not present on the map OR the relative Spawn Gate
is closed, roll the die until it matches an existing open Spawn Gate.

15.7  Enemy

Encounter card
1.	 Letter and Title: identifies
the Encounter card
2.	 Enemy Pictures: not related
to card activation
3.	 Main effect
4.	 Otherwise effect

Each time a new enemy enters play, the Active player must draw the top
card from the Enemy deck (reshuffling the discard pile when the deck runs
out of cards) and take the relevant Rank figure (Green, Blue or Red).

The new Enemy card must be assigned to a player. That player becomes the
controller for the particular enemy.
For quick and easy reference, place the matching Enemy Scroll near the
Enemy card.
To maintain game balance, Enemy card assignment follows these rules:
The card is normally assigned to the Active player, if he does not
control an enemy yet. Otherwise, the enemy is assigned to the first
player in clockwise order who does not have Enemy cards, or has
fewer Enemy cards assigned than other players. In case of tie, the
Enemy card is assigned to the Active player.
♦♦ Exception: When a second copy of the same Enemy card is drawn
(same name and Rank), assign it to the same player who controls
the first one. For example, a player who controls a Blue Gremlin is
assigned the second Blue Gremlin, when its card is drawn.
If all Enemy cards in the deck are assigned (all enemy figures are in play at
the same time), no more enemies can spawn on the battlefield, until at least
one enemy dies. Revealing a normal Enemy Shadow in these conditions
has no effect except to discard the Shadow token.

Note: Sometimes the game may require spawning a particular
enemy, due to a Story Event effect, or for a summoning power of
an enemy. In these cases, the Active player must draw and discard
Enemy cards from the deck (reshuffling the discard, if needed) until
the matching enemy is drawn.

Activation

♦♦

♦♦

(considered a wildcard that includes

all fighting styles.)
All enemies with specific conditions. For example, at 0 or
wounded.
“X” enemies, where “X” may be “No enemies” or up to 3 enemies.
When one of these cards is played, use the following rule:
Select X enemies to activate, starting with those controlled by the
Active player. If the Active player does not control enough enemies
to satisfy the requirement, also select enemies controlled by
the next player (in clockwise order) who does control enemies. 	
Continue to select enemies (an enemy may only activate once) until
the matching number detailed in the Encounter card is reached or
there are no more enemies to activate.

After resolving the “Activate No enemies” or the “Activate 3 enemies”
card, shuffle the Encounter deck with the discard pile and then discard the
resolved card to refresh the deck and make it more unpredictable.
Each enemy behavior (including the otherwise condition) indicated by an
encounter card, enemy power, or Book of Secrets is considered an activation.
Note: All matching enemies on the map must be activated sequentially,
one by one, starting with the ones controlled by the Active player
and following in clockwise order.

If any player controls more than one matching enemy, the player must
follow this activation priority order:
Activate the highest Rank first, so Purple, then Red, then Blue,
and then Green enemies.
♦♦ Do not activate stunned enemies, unless they are the only
matching enemy. This means, when an Encounter card says
“Activate 1 enemy” and the Active player has two assigned enemies
of the same Rank, and one is Stunned (section 15.11.6, page 52),
he cannot select the stunned enemy with the hope of skipping the
results of the activation. If the Active player has only one enemy to
be activated, and it is stunned, the enemy is activated, meeting the
requirement for the card, but does not take any actions.
♦♦ If a tie still exists, the Active player decides which to activate.
Activating an enemy means reading the relevant Enemy Scroll card and
applying the proper A.I. behavior, as described in the next sections. 	
Most Encounter cards have a main effect and an otherwise effect.
This second effect must be applied only when the main effect cannot
be even partially applied (there are no matching enemies for the main
effect at all). If neither the main effect nor the otherwise effect can be
applied, simply discard the card without further effect.

Activation Example

♦♦

Note: Encounter cards are not drawn when no enemies are in play
at the beginning of the Enemy Turn; however, some cards, like the
“Alarm” trap, may force the hero to draw an Encounter card, even
if there are no enemies in play.

Activation Example

During the Enemy Turn, the Encounter card “H – Fight” is
drawn. The first effect of this card is to activate 3 enemies in play.
In game are: 2 Green Raiders (assigned to the Active player),
a Green Orc Warrior, and a Blue Gremlin (both assigned to
another player).
The 2 Green Raiders are activated first (the controlling player
decides the order in which they act). The next enemy activated
will be the Blue Gremlin (Blue being higher-ranking).
The “Fight” second effect says to shuffle the Encounter
deck with its discard pile, and then discard the “Fight” card
(becoming the first card in the discard pile).

Note: When the game activates an enemy in the middle of the Hero
Turn (for instance, due to a Story Event effect), the hero must pause
his activities until the enemy activation is completed, then his turn
continues normally.

15.7.1  Selecting The Victim Hero
When activated, an enemy will move and fight by following the behaviors
specified by its Enemy Scroll. The behavior rules of the A.I. section are
based on the distance (measured in areas) between the enemy and its
closest hero in L.O.S. Each behavior rule can include a single number to
indicate the precise distance or a wide range of areas.
During the Enemy Turn, the Encounter card “E - Master
Assault” is drawn. Since there are no Purple enemies in
play, only the second part of the card text is resolved (after
“Otherwise…”), i.e., activate all highest Rank enemies.
There are 1 Green Orc and 2 Blue Gremlins in play. As Blue is a
higher Rank than Green, the two Gremlins are activated.

In all cases, each behavior rule, except + , requires L.O.S. and a legal
movement path.
Each time a behavior rule is selected, if there is more than one hero in the
indicated range, the enemy must first identify its preferred victim. This
happens by matching the enemy’s preferred victim icon, indicated by the
symbol in the top left corner of Enemy and Enemy Scroll card, with
heroes in L.O.S. within the range indicated by the behavior rule.

47

The preferred victim icon indicates the preference of the enemy to target a
particular hero, as indicated:

Closest
The closest hero in terms of areas of distance, starting

Richest

Fighting Style Based
The hero with the matching Fighting Style.

In case of multiple eligible targets, when there is no preferred victim
within the range indicated by the applied behavior rule, or in any other
tie situation, the enemy always uses these priority rules to select a victim,
from the top down:

If there is no appropriate behavior rule, the player must apply the last

The enemy, therefore, may move toward a hero, even if it is not able to see
him. When even this rule cannot be applied, the enemy maintains its
position, eventually applying its powers, if possibile.
Note: Only one behavior rule is played in each activation (the top
matching one), even if multiple rules apply.

A.I. Example

A.I. Example

A Blue Orc Warrior is activated. Laegon is in the Orc’s area,
while Auriel (1 wound suffered) and Ecarus are 1 area away.
A Blue Gremlin is activated. Its Enemy Scroll must be read and
applied as follow:
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

Is there a target at 0 ? If so, is one of them the Richest?
If yes, attack him!
Otherwise, attack one of the others at 0 using the
priority rules order. If the area is empty of targetable
heroes (since Shae is Hidden and thus non-targetable),
move to next condition.
Is there a target at 1 2 3 areas ? If so, is one of
them the Richest? If yes, move to engage and attack him!
Otherwise, move and attack one of the others within
1 2 3 areas using the priority rules order.
In this case, Auriel is the richest and she is in range,
but she is not in L.O.S. because she is in cover behind a
wall (only the + rule can be used, as the last attempt,
ignoring L.O.S.). Both Thorgar (3 areas away) and Laegon
(4 areas away) are in L.O.S. and possible targets. Thorgar
becomes the target, as he is within 3 areas (the range limit
for this condition).
The Gremlin advances to Thorgar’s area and attacks him
with Claws, then the Gremlin’s activation ends.

“Targeting” the victim occurs at the beginning of the enemy activation.
Once the A.I. behavior is selected, the enemy executes it entirely, even if the
conditions change. Movement and combat are covered in detail in the next
sections. 								
When a hero (or enemy) is Hidden (like the Shae power, for example), he
cannot be targeted directly from enemies. This also includes the "targeting"
of the closest hero with the + behavior for enemies. So basically, the Hidden
hero does not exist except for AoE or similar effects (like powers indicating
“all heroes within 1 area...”).

The first Orc’s AI rule says to select his victim at a distance of
0 1 areas.
fighting
Furthermore, his preferred victim is a hero using the
style. Therefore, the Orc will move 1 area (ignoring Laegon) and
attack Ecarus with his War Axes first. Then he will attack
again by discarding his charge token to use the Berserker I
power.
Note: Although Ecarus is in an area with terrain
Hindrance effects, the Orc ignores these effects during
both target selection and movement.

Note: The artificial intelligence is designed to cover every situation
on the battlefield, but, in some rare instances, two or more options
may be available to an enemy. In these cases, the controlling
player chooses.

15.8  Movement
Enemy movement is completely controlled by the Enemy Scroll cards.
Each card details relevant instructions on how and when to move an
activated enemy.
According to their specific behavior rules, enemies usually move toward
the victim hero, when specified away from him, or in rare cases, toward a
particular game element (a Spawn Gate, Waypoint, etc…).
While moving, an enemy always tries to reach the destination using
the shortest legal movement path possible, preferring to use areas
without terrain hindrances. Enemies need a legal movement path to
move, so they cannot walk across a blocking side; however, there are some
differences between the movement of enemies and heroes.

49

When moving an enemy, use the following guidelines:
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

Enemy Attack Example

To apply an A.I. behavior rule, there must be L.O.S. and a legal
movement path toward the victim. Only the + rule can be applied
without L.O.S.
When the rule indicates “Move to engage,” it means move the
enemy to the victim’s area, regardless of the distance.
When the rule indicates “Move X areas,” it means move X areas
toward the victim.
Unless necessary, enemies always try to avoid areas with terrain
Hindrances, by preferring to move through areas without
hindrances, except in case of sequential areas of a corridor or when
one of those areas is the destination area.
Enemies ignore all difficult and deadly terrain Hindrances effects.
Enemies may always move away from an area containing heroes,
if required to do so by their A.I., heroes do not perform reaction
attacks against a moving enemy.
Other enemies and heroes are not considered obstacles for a legal
movement path, and can be moved through.
When the A.I. directs an enemy to move toward the destination,
and the enemy is already there, it remains in its current position.
When the A.I. says to “Move back” or “Move away,” it means to
move in the direction from where the enemy came or, when not
possible, away from the closest hero, preferring empty areas. The
controlling player chooses in case of multiple options.
If, for any reason, the appropriate behavior rule cannot be applied,
apply the next one. If no rule can be applied, the enemy remains in
its current position.

rolled 3 magic, it could have used both effects.

15.9  Combat
Each Enemy Scroll card also controls combat behavior for the relevant
enemy. When an A.I. rule says to attack, the player controlling the Enemy
card starts combat using the indicated enemy’s weapon and powers against
the chosen victim.
The Combat System used for enemy attacks follows the same rules
explained before (section 9, page 32), with the following exceptions:
♦♦

♦♦

50

Any attack performed against a hero in the same area as the attacker
enemy is considered melee. All other attacks are considered ranged.
If the used weapon (when attacking) or armor (when defending) has
effects activated by dice results, the controlling player must activate
them during the relative “Applying effects” step of the HIT or
DEF stage.

,

The final attack results are: 4

0 .

If it is possible for multiple effects to activate, the controlling player
must spend results giving priority to the one requiring the most
results to be activated, even if this is not the best choice for the
enemy. Afterward, he can activate other effects, if any, following the
same guideline.
Note: When an enemy has only one weapon on its Enemy Scroll
card, it is considered both primary
and secondary
.

there are no other enemies in L.O.S. and the Healing Potion
cannot be used because no charges are available.
Note: The Readiness II power of the Raider is not used
because the Raider has moved into Ecarus’ area and not
the contrary!

A hero can target only one figure of the horde for each attack,
except when using an AoE (or multiple targets) attack/effect.
The Horde unit includes two or more figures (counting as 1 enemy),
each with separate HP. When attacked, each figure of the horde
defends and suffers damages, effects and body conditions as a
separate enemy with its own HP.
The Horde is destroyed and its Enemy card is discarded only when
all figures of the unit die.
When the Horde unit attacks, it has a clear L.O.S. to a given target,
if at least one figure of the unit has L.O.S. with the target.
When the Horde unit moves, the nearest figure to the victim moves
first and then the other figure moves to the same area, even if this
other figure was more distant.

15.11  Body

Conditions

The effects of Criticals, items, or powers may alter the characteristics or
capabilities of the enemy on the battlefield. When this happens, place the
relevant token on the Enemy card or near the figure to keep track.		
Discard it when the condition is removed or the enemy dies.

15.11.1  Knocked Out {K.O.}
Exactly like the heroes, a K.O.ed enemy is represented by laying the figure
down. It cannot use its
value and does not count for controlling/
dominating the area. The enemy remains K.O.ed until it is activated.
When this happens, as the first step of its activation, it automatically
recovers from K.O.; stand the figure and act as normal.

15.11.2  Permanent Criticals
Permanent (Red) Criticals follow the same rules explained for the heroes
(section 10.6.2, page 37).

15.11.3  Slowed
A Slowed enemy will select its behavior rule as usual during its next
activation, but it will perform only the first sentence of the rule. That
means until the first “.” is met. At the end of the activation, discard the
Slowed token. The enemy will act normally during future activations.

15.11.4  Poisoned
The Poison body condition follows the same rules
explained for the heroes (section 10.6.3, page 38), with
the following exception:
Enemies have no Save roll.
This means, unless particular power effects are present, a poisoned enemy
suffers damage in each Time Phase until death.
♦♦

51

15.11.5  Blinded
A Blinded enemy has no L.O.S. with any heroes, so it is forced
to use the + behavior rule during its next activation. This
means, when an Encounter card or an equivalent activation
effect activates that enemy, it ignores all other behavior rules of
its scroll card except the last one, which must be applied as normal (by
moving and using powers), but without performing any attack that
requires L.O.S. At the end of the activation, discard the Blinded token.
The enemy will act normally during future activations.
Note: Activating a blinded enemy with the + rule may indicate
moving toward a victim, even if it is already there. In this case,
ignore the movement part of the behavior rule.

A Stunned enemy must skip its next activation.		
This means, when an Encounter card or an equivalent
activation effect activates that enemy, it must instead ignore
the activation and then discard the stunned token.

The enemy will act normally during
future activations. If an enemy

including reaction attacks.

16.1  Fighting

Master Enemies
{Menacing Hero System}

Most Master Enemies have the power “Vengeful.” They are able to
tell at a glance who’s the most dangerous hero on the battlefield at the
moment. This hero is called the Menacing Hero and receives the Menace
token. The Master Enemy’s behavior is controlled by the Menacing Hero’s
position.

Vengeful

Menace token
Front

Menace token
Back

In game terms, when the Master Enemy has the “Vengeful” power, its
A.I. section only takes the distance between it and the Menacing hero
(the hero with the Menace token) into account, ignoring any other possible
victim. The Menace token has two sides, Level I and Level II, to indicate
the hero’s level of menace to the Master Enemy. During the course of a
battle, hero attacks and strategies will change the Master Enemy’s threat
perception, so the Menace token may pass from one hero to another.
The Menacing Hero system follows these rules:
♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

♦♦

54

When a Master Enemy enters play, the Menace token (Level I face
up) is immediately assigned to the Active player, who becomes the
Menacing Hero.
If the Menacing Hero deals at least one wound to the Master Enemy
with any attack, power, item, or controlled companion, the Menace
token must be increased (flipped) to Level II.
The Menacing Hero in L.O.S. with the Master Enemy can provoke
it by spending 1 Action
activity (and only one) to voluntarily
increase the Menace token from level I to level II or to decrease it
from level II to level I.
If any other hero deals at least one wound to the Master Enemy
with any attack, power, item, or controlled companion, the Menace
token is decreased to level I. If already at level I, the Menace token
is passed to the hero who dealt the wound, level I face up, and this
hero becomes the new Menacing Hero.
Any other hero in L.O.S. with the Master Enemy can provoke it
by spending 1 Action
activity (and only one) to decrease the
Menace token from level II to level I on its current owner or, if
already at level I, take the token to become the new Menacing Hero.
(The Menace token must be at level I to change heroes).
When the “Taunt” power (or any equivalent power that changes
the enemy’s victim) is used, immediately transfer the Menace token
(level I) to the power’s owner, regardless of the current state.
If the Menacing Hero dies or cannot be directly targeted due to an
item or power effect, the Menace token immediately passes (with
menace level I) to another hero chosen by the controlling player, if
possible. Otherwise, the token remains with the initial hero, who
cannot be attacked until he can be directly targeted again.

If the current Master Enemy card side has the “Vengeful” power,
the Master Enemy will always target the Menacing Hero as the
victim. Other heroes and companions may be damaged by its attacks
and powers, but they will never be its primary target.
♦♦ Like any standard enemy, “targeting” occurs at the beginning of
the enemy activation. Once the A.I. behavior is selected, the enemy
will follow it, even if the conditions change. For example: the
Menacing Hero is Ecarus and the Master Enemy A.I. says, “Move to
engage. Attack with Claws.” During or after the enemy’s movement,
another hero deals damage using an item or power, becoming the
new Menacing Hero. The Master Enemy will, nonetheless, attack
Ecarus, because he was the Menacing Hero when its A.I. behavior
was selected.
Except as detailed in these sections, Master Enemies follow all standard
rules and still count as a standard “enemy” for all game effects (such as:
powers, items, events, control, domination, Encounter cards, etc...).
♦♦

Note: the Menace token must be used even if the Master Enemy
does not have the “Vengeful” power on its current stage. This
means, the Menace token will continue to be passed between
heroes, even if the Master Enemy still targets the victim using the
normal system.

Master Enemy Example

The Heroes battle a huge Troll, which is Vengeful. Ecarus,
Knight of the White Rose, begins the battle, thus taking the
Menace token Level I. Since he is now the Menacing Hero,
Ecarus may spend 1 (and only one) Action
activity to
voluntarily increase the Menace token from level I to level II (1).
The Troll acts, and attacks Ecarus (2). Next, Laegon attacks and
wounds the Troll, reducing the Menace token (still with Ecarus)
from Level II to Level I (3). Then, the Ranger uses his innate
ability and attacks again, wounding the Troll and taking the
Level I Menace token for himself (4). During the Enemy Turn,
the Troll targets Laegon, but Ecarus, before the activation, uses
his innate ability “Taunt” (5) and becomes the preferred victim
yet again. The heroic knight gets the Level I Menace token, and
the Troll attack him instead.

						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1-5 players fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game system itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player controls one or more heroes &amp;ndash; legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery. Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This base game contains ACT I of III.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
