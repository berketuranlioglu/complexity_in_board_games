Gandhi ~ Rules

1.2 Components

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Gandhi is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent and
counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict during the end of the British
Raj in India, 1917-1947, up to the establishment of the modern
states of India and Pakistan.
Game setup is explained on page 39 of this rule book. An index
on pages 46-47 lists and defines key game terms. Sequences and
options for player and Non-player actions are summarized on
several aid sheets.

1.1 General Course of Play

In Gandhi, up to four players control Factions seeking to determine the fate of India: the British Raj, the Indian National
Congress, the Muslim League, and the Revolutionaries. Each
Faction uses its forces and a unique set of abilities to influence
spaces on the map. Moreover, each Faction is working towards
a unique victory goal. The Raj seeks to control territory and
influence the population of India to support its rule. The Indian
National Congress seeks to disrupt Raj control by building
popular opposition to the British. The Muslim League also
seeks opposition to the British Raj as a means of establishing
protected states for Muslim Indians. And the Revolutionaries
seek to disrupt British Raj control through unrest and to establish
bases of Hindu and Sikh influence.
Gandhi is Volume IX of the COIN Series of games that use
similar rules to cover modern and historical insurgencies. A deck
of cards regulates turn order, events, victory checks, and other
processes. Each turn, a new card is played from the event deck.
This card determines which two Factions will play this turn and
the order in which those Factions will play. Each Faction must
make a choice: make use of the card Event, or forgo the Event in
order to choose from a unique menu of Operations and Special
Activities. The choices of one Faction influence the others, as a
new card is drawn and play continues. Periodically, a Campaign
card interrupts play, affording the Factions a moment’s pause to
regroup and prepare for the next round. In the end, the Faction
that most exceeds its goal is the winner.

A complete set of Gandhi includes:
●	 A 34” by 22” game board (1.3)
●	 A deck of 72 Event cards (5.0)
●	 7 Campaign cards (2.4)
●	 A deck of 24 Arjuna cards (8.2).
●	 125 wooden pieces (1.4):
15 Troops (red cubes)
45 Sepoys (white cubes)
16 Muslim League Activists (small green cylinders)
16 Congress Activists (small orange cylinders)
16 Rev. Guerrillas (small octagonal black cylinders)
1 Leader (large orange cylinder)
5 Muslim League Bases (green discs)
5 Revolutionary Bases (black discs)
6 Eligibility and Resource tokens
(medium cylinders; 2 red, 1 green,1 orange, 2 black)
●	 12 wooden pawns (6 white, 6 black)
●	 A sheet of markers.
●	 A Sequence of Play and Campaign Round aid(6.0)
●	 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0)
●	 A Non-player aid foldout (8.0)
●	 4 6-sided dice (1 red, 1 orange, 1 green, 1 black)
●	 A background Playbook
●	 This Rules of Play manual

1.3 The Map

The map shows the British colony of India divided into various
spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. There are four types of map spaces: Provinces, Cities, States, and Railways:
●	 Cities are urban areas in India that historically were important
centers of British imperial administration.
●	 Provinces are areas that historically were administered
directly by the British Raj.
●	 States are areas that historically were not directly administered
by the Raj. Princely States (shaded yellow and printed on the
map) were ruled by independent Indian rulers. Muslim States
(denoted by a Muslim State marker in a Province’s Control

marker box placed during the game) are areas intended to
protect the autonomy of Muslim Indians.
●	 Railways are lines of communication along which the wealth
of India was exported to Britain.
1.3.2 Cities. Each City shows a Population of 1. Two Cities are
also Muslim spaces (1.3.4): Karachi and Calcutta.
1.3.3 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population of 1 or 2.
Seven Provinces are also Muslim spaces (1.3.4): Northwest
Frontier, Baluchistan, Sind, Punjab, West Bengal, East Bengal,
and Assam.
1.3.4 Muslim spaces. Green-tinged spaces marked with
a crescent moon icon are Muslim spaces.
Important: A Muslim State marker by itself does not turn a
space into a Muslim space.
1.3.5 States. There are two types of States: Princely States and
Muslim States.
Princely States are printed on the map and never
change status during the game. One Princely State,
Jammu & Kashmir, is also a Muslim space (1.3.4),
but it is not a Muslim State.
Muslim States come into play during the Muslim
League Negotiate and Infiltrate Special Activities
(4.4.1, 4.4.2) and some Events (5.0). A Muslim State
marker may only ever be placed in a Province, and
changes that space into a State. If the Muslim State marker is
later removed, the space reverts back to being a Province again.
PLAY NOTE: A Muslim State marker may be placed in a nonMuslim province.
Any rules that refer to States apply to both Princely States and
Muslim States. States are not Provinces and are never Controlled
by the Raj (they are always ‘spaces with no Raj Control’ and do
not add to Raj victory for Raj Control [7.2]). States may never
hold Troops. When a Muslim State is created, the Raj player
must immediately move any Troops there to any Cities.
Important: Raj Troops may never enter or be placed in
States at any time.
1.3.6 Railways. Railways affect several Operations (3.0) and
Special Activities (4.0). Each Railway is terminated either by a
City or a Town. Railways are never Controlled by the Raj and
they have neither a Support/Opposition value nor Population
(i.e., they do not add to Raj or Revolutionaries victory [7.2],
nor may they hold a Base [1.4.2]).
Each Railway has an Economic Value (Econ) that is added to Raj
Resources during the Resources Phase (6.2.2) if that Railway
does not have a Strike marker (1.12).
NV Activists are always Active (1.4.3) when on a Railway.
PLAY NOTE: Railways are spaces! “Non-Railway spaces”
are Cities, Provinces, and States.

3

1.3.7 Protest and Unrest. Spaces with a Protest marker (1.10)
are Protest spaces. Spaces with one or more Unrest markers
(1.11) are Unrest spaces.
1.3.8 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
certain Events. Any two spaces meeting one of the following
conditions are adjacent:
●	 Spaces that border (touch) one another.
●	 Provinces and States that would touch but for separation by
a Railway.
●	 Railways, Provinces, or States separated by Towns.
PLAY NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely terminate
Railways (1.3.6). There is one place on the map where a Town
links adjacent Provinces and States, in the south: Bombay
Presidency is adjacent to Coastal Andhra, and Hyderabad is
adjacent to Mysore.
1.3.9 Jail. The Jail box is used to hold Gandhi and Activists
arrested during the Raj Assault Operation (3.2.4), Treaty and
Govern Special Activities (4.2.1, 4.2.2), or placed there by
Events (5.0). Pieces in Jail are not considered on the map and
are not Available until released (during NV Rally Operations
[3.3.1], Congress Negotiate [4.3.1] or Satyagraha [4.3.2] Special Activities, by Events, or during Campaign Rounds). When
instructed to arrest NV pieces, move them to the Jail box.
1.3.10 Out of Play Box. The Out of Play Box holds forces
that are not Available until entered. Pieces that are Out of Play
enter during Operations or Events, or (for Raj only) during each
Crisis (6.8).
1.3.11 Restraint Track. The Restraint track (6.6)
measures the overall severity of the conflict in India.
It determines the cost of all Raj Operations that use
Sepoys (3.2) and Revolutionaries Unrest Operations
(3.4.4), limits the number of spaces Congress may select for
Operations (3.3), and determines the number of Available Protest markers (1.10).
1.3.12 Unity Track. The Unity track (6.7) measures
the level of tension between Hindu and Muslim
communities in India. It affects Muslim League and
Revolutionaries Rally (3.3.1, 3.4.1), and limits the
number of spaces the Muslim League may select for Operations
(3.3).

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces:
●	 British Army in India Troops (red cubes) and British Raj
Sepoys (white cubes). The Raj Event card icon is the Star
of India, and the Raj Eligibility icon is the British crown:
symbols of British royal sovereignty over India.
●	 Indian National Congress Activists (orange cylinders) and
Mohandas Gandhi (large orange cylinder). The Congress
Faction icon is a spinning wheel, a symbol of Indian
political and economic independence that was featured on
the Congress swaraj (home rule) flag of 1931.

Gandhi ~ Rules

●	 Muslim League Activists (green cylinders) and Bases (green
discs). The Muslim League Faction icon is a star and crescent,
a prominent symbol of Islam that later became the basis for
the flag of Pakistan.
●	 Revolutionaries Guerrillas (black octagons) and Bases (black
discs). The Revolutionaries Faction icon is a tiger, based
on the Azad Hind (free India) flag of the WWII era Indian
National Army.

●	 Rules that apply to Activists affect both Congress and Muslim
League pieces.
1.4.2 Stacking. Any number of forces may occupy a space,
except:
●	 The maximum number of Bases allowed in each space is
equal to the Population of the space (so Bases may never be
placed on Railways).
●	 Troops may never enter or be placed into States.
●	 A space may only ever hold at most one Protest marker. A
space may hold any number of Unrest markers.
1.4.3 Active Pieces. Certain Operations and Special Activities
affect only Active pieces.
●	 Raj cubes, Bases, and Gandhi are always Active.
●	 Activists are Active whenever they are in a Protest space
or on a Railway. Active Activists have their symbol end
up; otherwise, they are Inactive. All Activists in a space are
Active or Inactive together.
●	 Guerrillas are Active or Underground as individual pieces.
Active Guerrillas have their symbol end up; otherwise, they
are Underground. Always set up and place new Guerrillas
Underground (including if replacing a piece).
PLAY NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground”
Guerrillas, it is sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active). During play, flip Activists if entering
or leaving a Protest space.
Important: Activists are always Active whenever they are
in Protest spaces and Railways, and always Inactive everywhere else.

1.4.1 Availability and Removal. The inventory shown on the
“Available Forces” chart on page 48 of this rule book limits the
total number of pieces that may be in play. Forces not on the map,
in Jail, or in the Out of Play box are kept in the Available Forces
boxes. (Place Revolutionaries Bases in the highest-numbered
empty spaces in the Available Bases box, revealing the number
of on-map Bases to help track Revolutionaries Victory Points
and Resource earnings.)
●	 Forces may only be placed from and replaced with those
in the Available boxes—ignore any instructions to place or
replace forces if the appropriate type is not in the Available
box (remove rather than replace such pieces).
●	 Congress, the Muslim League, and Revolutionaries players
(only), while executing an Operation, Special Activity, or
Event, may remove their own pieces on the map to Available
Forces (exception: not Gandhi).
●	 During Raj Deploy (3.2.1), cubes may be taken from the map
if none are Available.
●	 Protest and Unrest markers may not be removed from the
map voluntarily, unless as instructed as part of an Operation,
Special Activity, Event, or during the Support or Reset Phases
of each Campaign Round.

1.4.4 Targeting Adversaries. Once targeted, removal or Activation of pieces to the extent of the executing Faction’s ability is
required. During Assault (3.2.4) and Treaty (4.2.1), Raj targets
NV forces as one Faction. During Attack (3.4.3), Revolutionaries
if successful may choose to remove any two adversary pieces
(not Gandhi; Troops and Bases last).
1.4.5 Leader. The Congress Faction receives one
leader token, representing Mohandas Gandhi. Gandhi
is not an Activist, but counts as a single piece for
purposes of Raj Control (1.7). Additionally:
●	 Gandhi is always Active (1.4.3).
●	 Gandhi cannot be eliminated but may be arrested during the
Raj Assault Operation (3.2.4), Treaty and Govern Special
Activities (4.2.2, 4.2.3), and certain Events (5.0).

1.5 Players & Factions

Gandhi is playable by 1, 2, 3, or 4 players. The Raj is a counterinsurgent (COIN) Faction, Congress and the Muslim League
are nonviolent (NV) Factions, and the Revolutionaries are an
insurgent Faction. Leftover Factions are Non-player Factions
(NP) governed by rules section 8.0.
Alternatively, with two or three players, the players may run
any leftover Factions:

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules
• With three players, one player runs Congress and Muslim
League or, if preferred, Raj and Revolutionaries.
• With two players, one player runs Congress and Muslim
League, the other Raj and Revolutionaries.
A player running two Factions uses the lower victory margin of
the two (7.1-.3) and only causes play to end on a victory check
(6.1) if both Factions are meeting their conditions.
For any given Faction, friendly pieces are all the pieces belonging to that Faction. Adversary pieces are any pieces belonging
to any other Faction.
PLAY NOTE: Congress and the Muslim League may require
more intricate play to achieve their potential and should go
to more experienced players.
1.5.1 Agreements. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules, binding only as follows: once a player agrees to
something within the execution of an Operation, Special Activity,
Event, or during the Support Phase, that agreement holds during
that action. A player failing to obtain agreement at the outset of
an action may cancel the action. All negotiations are open.
1.5.2 Transferring Resources. Raj and Revolutionaries may
transfer Resources to each other at any time that one of them is
executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event.

1.6 Support and Opposition

5

1.6.4 Total Muslim Opposition. The Muslim League only gains
victory points for Opposition in one of the 10 Muslim spaces
printed on the map (7.2):
Total Muslim Opposition =
(2 x Population of Muslim spaces in Active Opposition) +
(1 x Population of Muslim spaces in Passive Opposition)

1.7 Raj Control

Control affects certain Faction activities and victory. Only the Raj Faction may Control a space.
Adjust Control markers as Raj Control changes due
to Operations, Special Activities, Events, voluntary
force removal, and during the Redeploy Phase of Campaign
Rounds (6.4).
1.7.1 Raj Control. Raj gains Control in a City or Province if
the number of cubes there exceed all other Active pieces (1.4.3).
Congress, the Muslim League, and the Revolutionaries cannot
Control Cities or Provinces, but may deny Raj Control by the
presence of their Active pieces. Raj Control affects certain activities. Place or remove Raj Control markers as Raj Control changes
due to placement, removal, activation, or movement of pieces.
1.7.2 Spaces That May Be Controlled. Only Cities and Provinces can ever be Controlled by the Raj. Cities and Provinces
without sufficient cubes for Raj Control, Princely States, Muslim
States, and Railways are termed ‘spaces with no Raj Control.’

Support and Opposition affect victory and
some Operations and Special Activities.
1.6.1 Levels of Support/Opposition. City, Province, and State
spaces always show one of five levels of its populace’s Support
for or Opposition to the colonial Raj government:
●	 Active Support.
●	 Passive Support.
●	 Neutral.
●	 Passive Opposition.
●	 Active Opposition.
1.6.2 Active Support/Opposition. Active Support/Opposition
counts double Population for Total Support/Opposition (1.6.3,
1.6.4) affecting victory (7.2). Show the current level of Support
or Opposition with markers placed in each space. Show Neutral
by the absence of such markers.
1.6.3 Total Support & Total Opposition. Raj, Congress, and
Muslim League victory depends on the total value of population
Support or Opposition, respectively. Adjust VC markers on the
numbered edge track as any change to Support or Opposition
occurs.
Neutral
Total Support = (2 x Population in Active Support) +
(1 x Population in Passive Support)
Total Opposition = (2 x Population in Active Opposition) +
(1 x Population in Passive Opposition)

EXAMPLE of Raj Control: There are 2 Troops, 2 Sepoys, a Protest marker, and 5 Congress Activists in East Bengal. Raj does
not have more cubes than Active adversaries there, so no Raj
Control marker is placed in the space. If the Protest marker were
removed, all Activists would be flipped to their Inactive side and

6

Gandhi ~ Rules

cubes would exceed Active adversaries. In this case, Raj would
place a Raj Control marker in the space.
Important: Only count Active pieces when determining Raj
Control—all Raj cubes, Gandhi, all Bases, Active Guerrillas,
and Active Activists (any Activists in Protest spaces or on
Railways).

1.8 Resources

At any moment, Raj and Revolutionaries (only) each have between 0 and 50
Resources used to pay for Operations
(3.0), some Special Activities (4.0), and
during the Support Phase of Campaign
Rounds (6.3). Mark current Resources on the edge track with a
cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5).

●	 Railways may hold Protest markers. During the Resources
phase of each Campaign Round (6.2.1), convert each Protest
marker on a Railway into a Strike marker.
●	 Protest markers may only be removed during Congress and
Muslim League Negotiate (4.3.1, 4.4.1), Raj Govern (4.2.2),
and Muslim League and Revolutionaries Infiltrate (4.4.2,
4.5.2) Special Activities; by some Events (5.0); and during
Campaign Rounds (6.0).
●	 Raj cubes may not exit Protest spaces during Raj Garrison
(3.2.2), and Sweep (3.2.3) Operations, or Treaty (4.2.1)
Special Activity (but may enter Protest spaces).
●	 Changes in Restraint do not affect Protest markers already
on the map.

1.9 Victory Markers

Each Faction has a victory marker with which to track the following totals that affect victory (7.0).

●	 British Raj: Total Support (1.6) plus Population of Spaces
with Raj Control (1.7).
●	 Congress: Total Opposition (1.6).
●	 Muslim League: Total Muslim Opposition (1.6) plus the
twice the Total Population of Muslim States (1.3.5).
●	 Revolutionaries: Total Population of spaces with at least
one Unrest Marker (1.11) plus the number of Revolutionaries
Bases on the map.

1.10 Protest Markers

Protest markers are placed during NV Civil Disobedience and Demonstrate Operations (3.3.2,
3.3.3) and Events (5.0).

The total number of Protest markers Available to
be placed during Operations is limited by the current Restraint
value (6.6). Next to each space on the Restraint track there are
boxes that hold one or two Protest markers. During Operations,
only Protest markers in boxes to the right of and above the
Restraint marker are Available to be placed.
Restraint does not limit placement during Events. When placing a Protest marker during an Event, draw from the lowest
numbered occupied Protest marker box.
When removing markers from the map, return them to the highest numbered open Protest marker box, regardless of current
Restraint.
A Protest marker in a space makes that a Protest space. In addition:
●	 Flip all Activists in a Protest space to their Active side (1.4.3).
●	 Only one Protest marker may be placed in each space.

EXAMPLE of Available Protest Markers: Restraint is 4. Two
Protest markers are Available: those in boxes 1 and 2.

1.11 Unrest Markers

Unrest markers are placed during some Operations (3.0), Special Activities (4.0), and Events (5.0). The flipside of an Unrest
marker is a Strike marker (1.12).
●	 Unrest markers add to Revolutionaries Victory (7.2) but
unlike Protest markers do not have additional affects in their
space.
●	 Unrest markers are removed by Raj Imperialism during the
Govern Special Activity (4.2.3) and during the Support Phase

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules

7

(6.3.1), Congress Satyagraha Special Activity (4.3.2), NV
Negotiate Special Activity (4.3.1, 4.4.1), some Events (5.0),
and during the Reset Phase of each Campaign Round (6.5)
in spaces without Guerrillas.
●	 There are 12 Unrest/Strike markers total. If all Unrest markers
are in play, do not place one if called for.

1.12 Strike Markers

Strike markers are only placed on Railways. They may be placed
during some Operations (3.0), Events (5.0), and Campaign
Rounds. The flipside of a Strike marker is an Unrest marker
(1.11).
●	 The Raj Faction does not earn Resources from Railways with
Strike markers during the Resource Phase of each Campaign
Round (6.2.2).
●	 Strike markers are removed by the Raj Govern Special
Activity (4.2.2), some Events (5.0), and during the Reset
Phase of each Campaign Round (6.5).
●	 There are 12 Unrest/Strike markers total. If all Strike markers
are in play, do not place one if called for.

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions on page 39 of this rule book to choose
a scenario and various play options, assign Factions to players,
prepare the draw deck, and set up markers and pieces.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it in the Current Card box on the map. Then reveal the next card
on top of the Draw Deck. The card in the Current Card box is
played first; the card on top of the Draw Deck will be played next.
If a Campaign card (2.4) is revealed, stop play and swap it
with the card in the Current Card box. Immediately conduct a
Campaign Round (6.0).
EXAMPLE of Placing a Strike Marker: Revolutionaries execute
an Unrest Operation (3.4.4) on a 5 Econ Railway. Rather than
placing an Unrest marker, place a Strike marker instead.

1.13 Campaign Card Marker

A Campaign Card marker is kept on the Sequence of Play chart
on the map. Optionally, it may be used during Campaign Rounds
(6.0) to mark the current phase.

PLAY NOTE: Players will see one card ahead into the Draw
Deck (2.3.7). All played cards and the number of cards in the
draw deck are open to inspection. Move a Faction’s eligibility
cylinder into the appropriate box after all Operations, Special
Activities, or Events are completed.

Gandhi ~ Rules

2.3 Event Cards

When playing an Event card, up to two Factions will execute
an Operation or the Event. Each Eligible Faction may choose
either to act on the current card or Pass.
●	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction icons shown at
top of the card.
●	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or
Event on the previous card (or were made Eligible by Event text)
are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card in the “Eligible”
box per 2.3.6). Factions that did are Ineligible. All Factions start
the game Eligible.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost icon
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible
to execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost
is the 2nd Eligible.
PLAY NOTE: A faction icon marked by a rifle (Raj and Revolutionaries) or arrow (Congress and Muslim League) indicates
the Event card is a Non-player Faction Critical Event (8.8.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction opts to Pass, it
remains Eligible for the next card. Add 3 Raj Resources if Raj
passes or 1 Revolutionaries Resource if the Revolutionaries pass.
If either NV Faction passes, that Faction may move one Activist from Out of Play to Available (shift Unity +1 if moving an
Activist belonging to the other NV Faction). The next leftmost
Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing Faction as the new
1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the same options to
execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction Passes,
adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.
Important: Any time a NV Faction moves an Activist belonging to the other NV Faction from Out of Play to Available,
shift Unity +1 (whether during Rally or by Event).
2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.
FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass
(2.3.3), it may execute either:
●	 An Operation (3.0) in one or more spaces without a Special
Activity (4.0), OR
●	 An Operation (3.0) in one or more spaces with a Special
Activity, OR
●	 The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction
does not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation or possibly the Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible
Faction executed:
●	 Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation
only, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited
Operation (2.3.5).
●	 Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed
an Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction
may execute a Limited Operation or instead execute the
Event.

●	 Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd
Eligible Faction may execute an Operation in one or more
spaces, with a Special Activity if desired.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is an Operation in only one space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited
Operation is a Garrison (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), Demonstrate
(3.3.2) Operation, it can involve pieces from multiple origin
spaces but only one destination space; if March (3.4.2), it can
involve multiple destination spaces but only one origin space.
Factions may execute parts of the Operation that do not involve
spaces on the map (e.g., moving pieces from Out of Play during
Deploy or Rally). A Limited Operation counts as an Operation.
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and
Events (or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust
cylinders on the Sequence of Play track as follows:
●	 Any Faction that did not execute an Operation or Event (and
was not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible”
box.
●	 Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event (or was rendered ineligible by an Event)
to the “Ineligible” box.
2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, first remove the
played card in the Current Card box (or leave it there and stack
the new Current Card on top), then move the Draw Deck’s top
card into the Current Card box face-up, and finally reveal the
Draw Deck’s next card. Unless a Campaign Card (2.4) is revealed, play the new card in the Current Card box, proceeding
with the appropriate sequence.

2.4 Campaign Card

If a Campaign Card is revealed as the Upcoming Card, immediately swap it with the card in the Current Card box and conduct
an immediate Campaign Round (see 6.0). The swapped card will
be the first card played in the next round of play.
2.4.1 Final Campaign. If the last Campaign card’s Round is
completed without a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine
victory by 7.3.
PLAY NOTE: Each series of Event cards up to a Campaign
Round is called a “Campaign.”

2.5 British Viceroy

Each Campaign card also shows one of seven British Viceroys
who historically served as the Governor-General of India, typically for a five year term. During each Campaign, one Campaign
card will be placed in the British Viceroy of India box on the
map, becoming the current Viceroy for that Campaign.
At the start of the game (2.1), one Campaign card is chosen at
random to be the Viceroy for the first Campaign and placed face
up in the British Viceroy of India box. During each Campaign
Round (6.4.1), the Campaign card that triggered that Campaign
Round is placed in the British Viceroy of India box, replacing
the previous Campaign card and becoming the new Viceroy for
the next Campaign.

2.5.1 Viceroy Capability. Each Viceroy lists a special capability
that applies only to the Raj Faction if that Viceroy is the current
Viceroy. When a Campaign card is placed in the British Viceroy
of India box, its capability takes immediate effect and lasts until
replaced by the next Viceroy.

3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General

A Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses one of the four
Operations listed on its Faction aid sheet and, if applicable,
selects the map spaces to be involved. For Raj and Revolutionaries Factions (only), Operations cost Resources, often per space
selected; the paying Faction must have enough Resources to pay
for the Operation, including in each selected space. Congress and
the Muslim League Factions do not pay for Operations. Instead,
they may select only a limited number of total spaces (3.3).
3.1.1 Selecting Spaces. Spaces may only be selected once for
an Operation and may be selected in any order and at any time
during the turn. Generally, spaces selected for Operations may
be selected also for Special Activities and vice versa (exceptions:
NV Negotiate Special Activity [4.3.1, 4.4.1] may not select
spaces selected for Operations and vice versa; Revolutionaries
Assassination Special Activity [4.5.3] must select spaces already
selected for Unrest [3.4.4]).
3.1.2 Forces May Only Move Once. During Operations that
move pieces (Raj Garrison [3.2.2] and Sweep [3.2.3], NV Demonstrate [3.3.2], and Civil Disobedience [3.3.3], and Revolutionaries March [3.4.2]), pieces may only move once (though they
may enter multiple spaces en route to the selected destination,
as per the Operation procedure).
3.1.3 Pawns. Players may mark spaces selected for Operations
(3.0) and Special Activities (4.0), (or other actions) with pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.4 Targeting Factions. The executing Faction chooses the
other Factions or pieces to be affected (targeted), and the friendly
pieces to be placed or replaced. A single Operation may target
one or more Factions and ignore others. Once targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent possible (1.4.4).
PLAY NOTE: During Assault (3.2.4) and Treaty (4.2.1) remove
Congress and Muslim League pieces as one Faction. Raj may
choose to remove Gandhi if targeting NV forces.
3.1.5 Effects of Special Activities on Operations. A Special
Activity may alter Restraint or Unity. In all cases, determine the
cost or selection requirements for an Operation the moment a
space is selected.
EXAMPLES of the Impact of Restraint and Unity on Operations:
1.	Restraint is 2. Congress interrupts a Civil Disobedience
Operation to conduct the Negotiate Special Activity in Bihar,
which removes a Protest marker there and shifts Restraint to 3.
Congress may now select up to three spaces for Operations, as
well as any existing Protest spaces and the space with Gandhi.

2.	Unity is 1 and Restraint is 2. The Muslim League conducts
Non-Cooperation. At the end of the Operation, Restraint shifts
to 1. Since both Unity and Restraint are 1, India is in a state of
Crisis. The Muslim League may now follow its Operation with the
Infiltrate Special Activity to place a Muslim State in a Province
with a Muslim League Base and no Raj Control.
3.	Restraint is 1 and Unity is 2. Revolutionaries conduct an
Unrest Operation in a space with a Congress Activist, then interrupt the Operation to execute the Assassinate Special Activity
to remove the Congress piece. Unity shifts to 1, which triggers
Crisis. Revolutionaries may continue the Unrest Operation and
now may select spaces with both Congress and Muslim League
Activists.

3.2 Raj Operations

Raj chooses from Deploy, Garrison, Sweep, or Assault
Operations.

Important: During Raj Operations, the following rules
always apply:
●	 Pay Resources equal to Restraint only if Sepoys are used
(per the selected Operation instructions, unless modified
by the current Viceroy). Pay 0 to Operate in a space if only
Troops are used.
●	 Cubes may not exit Protest spaces (including Railways)
during Operations.
●	 Troops may not enter States.
●	 The current Viceroy capability may modify the cost or
effects of the current Operation (2.5.1).
3.2.1 Deploy. Deploy augments Raj forces and moves cubes
from the Out of Play box to Available. Select any Cities. Pay
Resources equal to Restraint per selected City to add any Sepoys
there. If only adding Troops, pay 0.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected City, place up to six cubes.
If no more cubes of that type are Available (1.4.1), cubes may
be taken from elsewhere on the map.
Then, may move any two cubes from Out of Play (1.3.10) to
Available.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Willingdon is the current Viceroy, Deploy costs 1
Resource per selected City to place Sepoys.
●	 If Lord Reading is the current Viceroy, the first space
selected for Deploy is free.
3.2.2 Garrison. Garrison Operations move Raj forces quickly
along the Railway network. Pay Resources equal to Restraint to
move any Sepoys or 0 Resources to move only Troops.
PROCEDURE: Cubes in spaces without Protest may move
into any adjacent Railway or City, and may continue to move
along adjacent Railways or Cities and finally, if desired, into
adjacent Raj-Controlled destinations. Moving cubes must stop
at any Active adversaries and may not exit Protest spaces. If
a Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end in a

10

Gandhi ~ Rules

single destination space (but may originate in several). Cubes
may only move once during the Operation.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	If Lord Reading is the current Viceroy, Garrison is free.

EXAMPLE of Garrison: Restraint is 2. Raj pays 2 Resources to
move 2 Troops from West Bengal and 3 Sepoys from Rajputana
along Railways into spaces across India with Raj Control. The
Protest marker in Bihar prevents the Sepoys in Bihar from using
Garrison to move. The Active Activist on the Railway between
Central India Agency and Central Provinces would force any
cubes using that Railway to stop moving.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweep Operations move Troops and Sepoys
and locate Guerrillas. Select any non-Railway spaces as final
destinations. Pay Resources equal to Restraint per destination
space to use Sepoys (i.e., to move them or to Sweep in place
with them) or 0 Resources per space to use only Troops there.
If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end in a
single destination space (but may originate in several).
PROCEDURE: Move cubes not in Protest spaces into selected
destination spaces from adjacent spaces (even from Railway
spaces). Cubes may first move onto an adjacent Railway with
no Strikes, Activists, or Active Guerrillas, and then must move
into an adjacent destination space. Then, in each destination Activate one Guerrilla for every cube there (whether newly moved
or already there; include Sepoys already there only if paid for).
Important: During Garrison, Sweep, and Treaty, no cubes
may exit Protest spaces. Troops may not move into States.
Cubes that entered Railways during Sweep may not remain
on Railways at the end of the Operation.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Irwin is the current Viceroy, Sweep costs 1
Resource per space selected to use Sepoys.
●	 If Lord Reading is the current Viceroy, the first space
selected for Sweep is free.

EXAMPLE of Sweeping in Place: Restraint is 4. Raj selects
Madras Presidency, with 1 Sepoy and 2 Underground Guerrillas, as a Sweep destination. After moving 1 Troop into Madras
Presidency, Raj pays 4 Resources to use the Sepoy already there,
along with the moving Troop, to flip both Guerrillas Active. Cubes
no longer exceed Active adversaries in Madras Presidency, and
Raj Control is lost. Had Raj not paid to use the Sepoy, only 1
Guerrilla would have been Activated by the moving Troop, and
Raj would have retained Control.
3.2.4 Assault. Assault removes Active Guerrillas and Bases, and
arrests Gandhi and Active Activists. Select any spaces with Raj
forces. Pay Resources equal to Restraint per selected Assault
space to use any Sepoys there or 0 Resources per space to use
only Troops there.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove or arrest Active
pieces per the number of Raj cubes involved, as follows:
●	 If the Operation uses only Sepoys, remove one piece for
every two Sepoys (round down).
●	 If the Operation uses any Troops (with or without Sepoys),
remove one piece for every cube.
BASES LAST: Remove Muslim League Bases only once no
Activists (Muslim League plus Congress) remain in the space.
Remove Revolutionaries Bases only once no Guerrillas remain
in the space.
NV TO JAIL: Guerrillas and Bases are removed to Available.
Gandhi and Activists are arrested and moved to the Jail box
(1.3.9). Treat Congress and the Muslim League as one Faction
when targeting NV pieces (1.4.4).

11

Gandhi ~ Rules
GANDHI: Gandhi is arrested like NV Activists (though he is
always Active). Though Raj may always choose to arrest Gandhi,
it is not required to do so unless forced to by 1.4.4 (i.e., if cubes
used to Assault equal or exceed Active Activists plus Gandhi).
If Gandhi is arrested during a Raj Operation or Special Activity,
at the end of the Raj turn:
●	 First shift Restraint –1.
●	 Then, Congress may place up to two Available Protest
markers in any non-Railway spaces that do not already have
one.
Important: Only Activists in spaces with Protest or on
Railways are Active (1.4.3), and may therefore be targeted
during Assault.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Chelmsford is the current Viceroy, Assault costs 1
Resource per space selected to use Sepoys.
●	 If Lord Wavell is the current Viceroy, Raj may conduct
a free limited Sweep (3.2.3) into one space selected for
Assault. This Sweep may include both Troops and Sepoys.
This free Sweep Operation may occur at any time during
the Assault Operation.
●	 If Lord Reading is the current Viceroy, the first space
selected for Assault is free.

3.3 Nonviolent Operations

Congress and the Muslim League choose from
Rally, Demonstrate, Civil Disobedience, or NonCooperation Operations.

Important: NV Factions do not pay for Operations, instead
selecting a limited number of spaces for free. Congress may
select a number of spaces up to Restraint and in addition
spaces with a Protest marker and/or Gandhi. The Muslim
League may select a number of spaces up to Unity and in
addition spaces with a Muslim League Base.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment forces, move Activists
from Out of Play, and may shift Unity.
●	 Congress may select Cities, Provinces, and States without
Support up to Restraint, plus any Cities, Provinces, and States
with a Protest marker or with Gandhi.
●	 The Muslim League may select Cities, Provinces, and States
without Support up to Unity plus any spaces with a Muslim
League Base.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected space:
●	 Congress places Activists up to the space’s Population.
●	 The Muslim League places Activists equal to one plus the
number of Muslim League Bases there. Or, in a non-Railway
space with room (1.4.2), the Muslim League may instead
replace a number of Muslim League Activists equal to Unity
(6.7) with a Muslim League Base.
Place Activists Active side up if placing in a Protest space.
Then, the executing Faction may either:
●	 Move one Activist from the Out of Play box (1.3.10) to
Available, OR
●	 Release a die roll of Activists from Jail. A Faction must
release prisoners equal to the die roll if possible, including
Activists belonging to the other NV Faction if needed.
Important: Each time a NV Faction moves an Activist belonging to the other NV Faction from Out of Play to Available, shift Unity +1 (during Rally, Events, or when Passing).

EXAMPLES of Arresting NV during Assault: Restraint is 3.
Since Lord Chelmsford is the current Viceroy, Raj pays only 1
Resource to execute Assault in Bihar with one Troop and three
Sepoys. Also in Bihar are Gandhi, two Active Congress Activists and one Active Muslim League Activist there. Raj targets
the Activists and Gandhi and must move all 4 pieces to Jail.
Since Gandhi was arrested, at the end of the Raj turn Restraint
decreases to 2 and Congress then places 2 Available Protests in
any non-Railway spaces.
© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

12

Gandhi ~ Rules
3.3.2 Demonstrate. Demonstrate Operations move friendly
Activists and may place Protest markers.
●	 Congress may select non-Railway destination spaces up to
Restraint, plus any non-Railway spaces with a Protest marker
or with Gandhi.
●	 The Muslim League may select non-Railway destination
spaces up to Unity, plus any spaces with a Muslim League
Base.
PROCEDURE: Activists may move into each destination space
from any adjacent spaces (including from Railway spaces). If
a Limited Operation (2.3.4), all moving pieces must end in a
single destination. If the destination space has no Raj Control,
the active Faction may place an Available Protest marker if
none there already. Congress (only) may move a total number
of Muslim League Activists up to Unity if they are accompanied
by moving Congress Activists one for one. Activists (including
Muslim League Activists moved during Congress Demonstrate)
may only move once during the Operation.
PLAY NOTE: Only Activists may move during Demonstrate
Operations; Congress moves Gandhi during the Satyagraha
Special Activity (4.3.2).

EXAMPLE of Selecting Spaces for Rally: The Muslim League
executes Rally. Unity is 3, so they may select up to three spaces
without a Muslim League Base and any other space with a Muslim League Base. The Muslim League selects Sind, Baluchistan,
and Karachi (all spaces without Support). It also chooses to Rally
in Punjab, because it may also Rally in any space with a friendly
Base, regardless of Unity or Support.

EXAMPLE of Placing Protest during Demonstrate: Restraint
is 2 and three Protest markers are Available. In Bihar there are
three Congress Activists and a Protest marker. Congress wants
to use Demonstrate to move the Activists out of Bihar into adjacent spaces in order to place additional Protest markers. Since
Restraint is 2, Congress may select up to two spaces without
Protest as destinations (in addition to all spaces with Protest).
One Activist moves into West Bengal. Since West Bengal does
not have Raj Control (the lone Sepoy there does not outnumber
the Active Guerrilla), Congress may place an Available Protest
there. Another Activist moves into United Provinces. Raj does
Control that space, however, so no Protest may be placed there,
and the moving Activist is flipped to its Inactive side.

Gandhi ~ Rules
3.3.3 Civil Disobedience. Civil Disobedience Operations place
Protest markers and may move Activists onto Railways.
●	 Congress may select spaces with Activists up to Restraint,
plus any spaces with a Protest marker or with Gandhi.
●	 The Muslim League may select spaces with Activists up to
Unity, plus any spaces with a Muslim League Base.
PROCEDURE: Place an Available Protest marker if none there
already. Activate all Activists in the space. Then, the active Faction may move any friendly Activists from the selected space
onto adjacent Railways.

EXAMPLE of Moving onto Railways during Civil Disobedience: Restraint is 3 and there are two Protest markers Available.
Congress executes Civil Disobedience to place Protest markers
in Bombay Presidency and Coastal Andhra. Able to select one
more space, but with no Protest markers Available, Congress
chooses to move the Activist in Hyderabad onto the 4-Econ
Railway adjacent to Bombay Presidency.

13

3.3.4 Non-Cooperation. Non-Cooperation Operations decrease
Restraint and shift Population towards Active Opposition.
●	 Congress may select Protest spaces with Congress Activists
and no Raj Control (exception: during Crisis, Congress may
select spaces with Raj Control, 6.8).
●	 The Muslim League may select spaces with Protest, Muslim
League Activists, and a Muslim League Base plus spaces
with Protest and Muslim League Activists up to Unity, each
with no Raj Control.
PROCEDURE: Shift each selected space one level towards
Active Opposition. Lastly, after executing Non-Cooperation in
all selected spaces, shift Restraint –1.

EXAMPLE of Non-Cooperation: Congress executes NonCooperation to add Opposition in southern India. It may select
Protest spaces with Congress Activists and - since India is not in
Crisis - no Raj Control. Here, Coastal Andhra will shift towards
Active Opposition. Bombay Presidency may not be selected
because it has Raj Control, and Hyderabad may not be selected
since only spaces with Congress Activists may be chosen and
Gandhi is not an Activist.

Gandhi ~ Rules

3.4 Revolutionaries Operations

Revolutionaries choose from Rally, March, Attack, or
Unrest Operations.

3.4.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment forces, build Revolutionaries Bases, and move Guerrillas from Out of Play. Select
Cities, Provinces, and States each without Support or any with
a Revolutionaries Base. Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, place Guerrillas equal
to one plus the number of Revolutionaries Bases there, or replace a number of Guerrillas there equal to Unity (6.7) with a
Revolutionaries Base.
Then, Revolutionaries may move one Guerrilla from the Out of
Play box (1.3.13) to Available.

3.4.2 March. March Operations move Revolutionaries Guerrillas. Moving pieces may begin in any spaces. Cost is 1 Resource
per space where moving Guerrillas originate (exception: each
Railway origin costs 0). A Limited Operation (2.3.5) March may
select only a single origin space (and may move Guerrillas into
more than one destination).
PROCEDURE: Revolutionaries select origin spaces. From each
selected origin, any Guerrillas there may move into adjacent
spaces. In addition, Underground Guerrillas may move along
a chain of adjacent Railways and Cities, if desired, and then
into adjacent spaces. Guerrillas may only move once during
the Operation.
In each destination space at either Active or Passive Support and
on each Railway destination, if moving Guerrillas plus cubes
exceed 3, Activate the moving Guerrillas (only).

EXAMPLE of Placing a Base during Rally. Unity is 2. Revolutionaries pay 1 Resource to Rally in Punjab. Rather than place
Guerrillas, they exchange 2 Guerrillas there for a Revoluarionies
Base, placing it in the last remaining Base space.

EXAMPLE of Guerrillas Moving during March. Revolutionaries
pay 1 Resource to select Orissa as a March origin space and
plan to move all four Guerrillas there. Two Guerrillas move
into the adjacent Central Provinces. Although moving Guerrillas plus cubes exceed three, the space does not have Support
so the moving Guerrillas remain Underground. The Guerilla
moving into Bihar, however, is not so lucky: moving Guerrillas
plus cubes there exceeds three and the space does have Support,
so the moving Guerrilla is flipped to its Active side. The last
Guerrilla in Orissa may move along the Railway line because it
starts its move Underground. It moves into the United Provinces.
Although the United Provinces has Support, moving plus cubes
does not exceed three there, so the moving Guerrilla remains
Underground.

Gandhi ~ Rules
3.4.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate adversaries
and may spread Unrest. Select any Cities, Provinces, and States
with Guerrillas. Pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate all Guerrillas
(1.4.3) and roll a die. If the result is less than or equal to the
total number of Guerrillas there, remove up to two Active pieces
(exception: not Gandhi). Then, if the Attack was successful
and the space has a Protest marker or no Raj Control, add one
Unrest marker.
●	 Remove Muslim League Bases only once no Activists
(Muslim League plus Congress) remain in the space.
●	 Remove Sepoys before any Troops.
●	 Attack may remove pieces belonging to two different
Factions.

15

3.4.4 Unrest. Unrest Operations decrease Restraint,
affect Support and Opposition, and place Unrest and
Strike markers. Select any spaces where Revolutionaries have at least one Underground Guerrilla or,
during Crisis (6.8) only, select any spaces with both Congress
Activists and Muslim League Activists (including spaces without Underground Guerrillas). For each space selected for Unrest,
pay Resources equal to Restraint.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space Activate one Underground Guerrilla if one is present (even during Crisis). If the
space is a non-Railway space, add one Unrest marker and shift
the space one level towards Neutral. If the space is a Railway,
add one Strike marker if none there. Lastly, after executing
Unrest in all selected spaces, shift Restraint –1.

PLAY NOTE: Attack may place Unrest in spaces where Raj just
lost Control when attacking Guerrillas Activated. Revolutionaries may also choose to Attack spaces without adversaries,
solely to place Unrest.

EXAMPLE of Attack. Revolutionaries pay 1 Resource to Attack in
East Bengal. All three Guerrillas there Activate. Since Raj cubes
no longer exceed Active adversaries, Raj Control is lost in East
Bengal. Revolutionaries roll for the Attack: 2, a success! Both
cubes are removed to Available. Since the Attack was a success,
and there is no Raj Control there, Revolutionaries place an Unrest
marker in the space. Next, they pay another 1 Resource to Attack
in Bihar, Activating both Guerrillas. The roll is a 1, another success! Two Sepoys are removed. Lastly, Revolutionaries place an
Unrest marker because there is a Protest marker in the space.

EXAMPLE of Unrest. India is in Crisis! Revolutionaries pay 1
Resource (Restraint is always 1 when India is in Crisis) to select
Bombay Presidency for Unrest. They Activate the Underground
Guerrilla there and add an Unrest marker. With India in Crisis,
they may also select Bombay because it has both a Congress
Activist and a Muslim League Activist! They pay 1 Resource to
select Bombay and place an Unrest marker there.

Gandhi ~ Rules
4.2.1 Treaty. Treaty allows the Raj to operate in Princely States
and Muslim States. Select any States.

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General

When a Faction per the Event card sequence of play (2.3) executes an Operation (3.0), it may also execute one of its Special
Activities (exception: Limited Operations, 2.3.5).
●	 As with Operations, the executing Faction selects spaces,
Factions, or pieces affected and the order of actions
undertaken.
●	 A Faction may execute its Special Activity at any one
time immediately before, during, or immediately after its
Operation.
●	 If executing a Special Activity during an Operation, the
Special Activity must be fully completed before returning to
the Operation (i.e., Special Activities themselves may not be
interrupted).
4.1.1 Selecting Spaces. Spaces may only be selected once for
a Special Activity and may be selected in any order. Generally,
spaces selected for Operations may be selected also for Special
Activities and vice versa (exceptions: NV Negotiate Special Activity [4.3.1, 4.4.1] may not select spaces selected for Operations
and vice versa; Revolutionaries Assassinate Special Activity
[4.5.3] must select spaces already selected for Unrest [3.4.4]).

PROCEDURE: In each selected State, either:
●	 Remove one Active piece for every Sepoy, OR
●	 Move any Sepoys not in Protest spaces into the selected State
from adjacent spaces.
BASES LAST: Remove Muslim League Bases only once no
Activists (Muslim League plus Congress) remain in the space.
Remove Revolutionaries Bases only once no Guerrillas remain
in the space.
NV TO JAIL: Guerrillas and Bases are removed to Available.
Gandhi and Activists are arrested and moved to the Jail box
(1.3.9). Treat Congress and the Muslim League as one Faction
when targeting NV pieces (1.4.4).
GANDHI: Gandhi is arrested like NV Activists (though he is
always Active). Though Raj may always choose to, it is not
required to arrest Gandhi unless forced to do so by 1.4.4. If
Gandhi is arrested during a Raj Operation or Special Activity,
at the end of the Raj turn:
●	 First, shift Restraint –1.
●	 Then, Congress may place up to two Available Protest
markers in any non-Railway spaces that do not already have
one.

4.1.2 Accompanying Operations. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operation and take
place in any otherwise valid spaces (exceptions: Congress and
Muslim League Negotiate [4.3.1, 4.4.1] and Revolutionaries
Assassinate [4.5.3]).

4.2 Raj Special Activities

Raj may choose from Treaty, Govern, and Martial Law
Special Activities.

Important: During Raj Special Activities, the following
rules always apply:
●	 Cubes may not exit Protest spaces (including Railways)
during Treaty (4.2.1).
●	 The current Viceroy capability may modify the effects of
the current Special Activity (2.5.1).
●	 Only Activists in spaces with Protest or on Railways are
Active (1.4.3), and may therefore be targeted during Treaty
(4.2.1) and Govern (4.2.2).

EXAMPLE of Treaty. Raj selects Orissa and the Muslim State in
West Bengal for Treaty. It moves three Sepoys into West Bengal
from adjacent spaces (the Troop in East Bengal may not accompany the Sepoys as Troops may never enter States). Then, the
two Sepoys already in Orissa remove the Active Guerrilla and
arrest the Activist there.
© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules
4.2.2 Govern. Govern removes adversary pieces, Strikes,
Muslim States, and Unrest and builds Support. Select up to two
spaces with cubes.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either:
●	 Remove one Active piece, OR
●	 In a space with no Activists, remove either a Strike or Protest
marker, OR
●	 In a space with no Active adversaries, buy Imperialism for
one or two levels.
BASES LAST: Remove Muslim League Bases only once no
Activists (Muslim League plus Congress) remain in the space.
Remove Revolutionaries Bases only once no Guerrillas remain
in the space.
NV TO JAIL: Guerrillas and Bases are removed to Available.
Gandhi and Activists are arrested and moved to the Jail box
(1.3.9).
GANDHI: Gandhi is arrested like NV Activists (though he is
always Active). If Gandhi is arrested during a Raj Operation or
Special Activity, at the end of the Raj turn:
●	 First shift Restraint –1.
●	 Then, Congress may place up to two Available Protest
markers in any non-Railway spaces that do not already have
one.

17

for 3 Resources per shift. In Hyderabad, it may remove the Active
Guerrilla. And on the Railway, it may remove the Strike marker.
In any case, Raj may only select up to two of these spaces for
Govern.
4.2.3 Martial Law. Martial Law shifts Support or Opposition,
and removes Protests and Activists to Available at the cost of
adding Unrest. Raj may select any one space with both cubes
and Activists, or any two spaces with cubes and Activists during Crisis (6.8).
PROCEDURE: In the selected space, remove one Activist to
Available for every cube. Remove any Protest Marker. If the
space is a non-Railway space, add one Unrest marker (exception:
if Lord Linlithgow is Viceroy, Martial Law does not add Unrest).
Finally, shift the space one level towards Neutral.
PLAY NOTE: Unlike during Assault, Treaty, and Govern, during Martial Law Raj may target Inactive Activists.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Linlithgow is the current Viceroy, Martial Law
does not add Unrest.

IMPERIALISM: Every 3 Resources spent (exception: if Lord
Mountbatten is Viceroy, every 2 Resources spent) removes one
Unrest marker, or—once no Unrest markers are in the space—
either shifts the space one level towards Active Support, up
to two levels per space, or—in a Muslim State—removes the
Muslim State marker.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Mountbatten is the current Viceroy, Imperialism
costs 2 Resources per marker removed or level shifted.

EXAMPLE of Martial Law. Raj selects Punjab for Martial Law.
There are four cubes there; Raj may remove any four Activists.
The Active Guerrilla may not be targeted during Martial Law.
Also, Raj shifts the space to Neutral and places one Unrest
marker.

EXAMPLE of Govern. Raj has several options for Govern in
southern India. With no Active adversaries in Bombay Presidency, it may buy Imperialism to shift Support up to two levels,

4.3 Congress Special Activities

4.3.2 Satyagraha. Satyagraha moves Gandhi, and then either
removes Protest and Unrest or places a Congress Activist.
Choose any one space.

4.3.1 Negotiate. Negotiate releases Gandhi from Jail or removes
a Muslim State and may accompany Rally (3.3.1), Demonstrate
(3.3.2), or Civil Disobedience (3.3.3). Select one space with
Congress Activists and no Raj Control, not selected for Operations.

PROCEDURE: First, move Gandhi to the selected space (may
release from Jail if Raj agrees). Then, either remove a Protest
marker (if any is present) plus one Unrest marker (if any present),
OR place one Congress Activist there from Available.

Congress may choose from Negotiate, Satyagraha, and
Persuade Special Activities.

PROCEDURE: In the selected space, remove any Protest marker
(unless on a Railway, flip any Activists there Inactive). Shift
Restraint +1. Then, may either:
●	 Roll a die. If the result is greater than than the number of
Protests in India, release Gandhi from Jail to the selected
space and shift the space one level towards Active Support,
OR
●	 If there is a Muslim State marker in the space and Congress
pieces (Activists plus Gandhi) exceed Muslim League pieces
(Activists plus Bases) there, remove the Muslim State marker
and set the space to Neutral.

PLAY NOTE: If Raj refuses to release Gandhi from Jail, Congress may select an alternate Special Activity.

EXAMPLE of Satyagraha. Congress executes Satyagraha. First,
it moves Gandhi to United Provinces. Then, it chooses to add
a Congress Activist. Now that cubes no longer exceed Active
adversaries, Congress removes the Raj Control marker. Now the
space is vulnerable to Non-Cooperation in a later turn!
EXAMPLE of Congress Negotiate. Congress selects West Bengal
for Negotiate. First (without a Protest marker to remove), it shifts
Restraint +1. Congress pieces outnumber Muslim League pieces
there, so Congress chooses to remove the Muslim State marker.
After placing a Raj Control marker in the space, Congress sets
the space to Neutral.

19

Gandhi ~ Rules
4.3.3 Persuade. Persuade removes adversary pieces or Activates
Guerrillas. Select up to two spaces with Congress pieces.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:
●	 Remove one Active adversary piece, OR
●	 Activate one Guerrilla for every Active NV piece there
(Congress plus Muslim League).
Lastly, if one or more Muslim League pieces were removed,
shift Unity –1.
TROOPS AND BASES LAST: Do not remove a Troop from the
selected space if any Sepoys remain. Likewise, do not remove
a Muslim League Base if any Muslim League Activists remain,
nor remove a Revolutionaries Base if any Guerrillas remain.

EXAMPLE of Persuade. Congress selects Mysore and Madras
Presidency for Persuade. In Mysore, no Guerrillas remain to
protect the Revolutionaries Base, so Congress may remove the
Base. In Madras Presidency, Congress chooses to remove the
Muslim League Activist. Since at least one NV piece was removed,
Congress must shift Unity –1.

4.4 Muslim League Special Activities

The Muslim League may choose from Negotiate, Infiltrate, and Persuade Special Activities.

4.4.1 Negotiate. Negotiate removes an Unrest marker or places
a Muslim State marker and may accompany Rally (3.3.1),
Demonstrate (3.3.2), or Civil Disobedience (3.3.3). Select one
space with Muslim League Activists and no Raj Control, not
selected for Operations.
PROCEDURE: In the selected space, remove any Protest marker
(unless on a Railway, flip any Activists there Inactive). Shift
Restraint +1. Then, may either:
●	 If there is at least one Unrest marker in the selected space,
shift the selected space one level towards Active Support
then remove one Unrest marker from the space, OR
●	 If the space is a Muslim Province at Passive or Active
Opposition where Muslim League pieces (Activists plus
Bases) exceed Congress pieces (Activists plus Gandhi), set
the space to Passive Support and place a Muslim State marker
there. Raj must move any Troops there to any Cities.

EXAMPLE of Muslim League Negotiate. The Muslim League
wants to establish a Muslim State in East Bengal. Because East
Bengal is not Raj Controlled and is at Opposition, the Muslim
League decides to Negotiate there. First they remove the Protest
marker (and flip Activists to Inactive), then they Shift Restraint
+1. Finally they set East Bengal to Passive Support and place
a Muslim State. The Troop is forced to leave the new State. Raj
moves it to Calcutta.

4.4.2 Infiltrate. Infiltrate replaces an adversary piece with a
Muslim League Activist or places a Muslim State. Select one
space with a Muslim League Activist.
PROCEDURE: In the selected space, either:
●	 Replace one Sepoy, one Guerrilla (even if Underground), or
a Protest marker with one Muslim League Activist, OR
●	 During Crisis (6.8) place a Muslim State in a Province with
a Muslim League Base and no Raj Control (Raj must move
any Troops there to any Cities).

4.4.3 Persuade. Persuade removes adversary pieces or Activates
Guerrillas. Select up to two spaces with Muslim League pieces.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:
●	 Remove one Active adversary piece, OR
●	 Activate one Guerrilla for every Active NV piece there
(Muslim League plus Congress).
Lastly, if one or more Congress Activists were removed, shift
Unity –1.
TROOPS AND BASES LAST: Do not remove a Troop from
the selected space if any Sepoys remain, nor remove a Revolutionaries Base if any Guerrillas remain.

EXAMPLE of Persuade. The Muslim League selects Punjab as
one of its two spaces for Persuade. It would like to execute NonCooperation here, but Raj Control prevents the space from being
selected. So the Muslim League chooses to Activate both Guerrillas (one for each Active NV Activist there). Now, with Raj Control
taken away, Punjab may be selected for Non-Cooperation.
EXAMPLE of Muslim League Infiltrate. India is in Crisis and
the Muslim League selects Sind for Infiltrate. In Sind are one
Sepoy, one Guerrilla, one Muslim League Base, and one Muslim
League Activist. The Muslim League could replace the Sepoy or
Guerrilla with an Activist, but because Sind does not have Raj
Control (the Muslim League base is always Active and counts
for determining Control), the Muslim League takes advantage
of the Crisis to place a Muslim State there.

4.5 Revolutionaries Special Activities

4.5.2 Infiltrate. Infiltrate replaces a Sepoy, Activist, or Protest
with a Guerrilla or places a Revolutionaries Base. Select one
space with an Underground Guerrilla.

4.5.1 Aid. Aid enables Revolutionaries to gain Resources or flip
Active Guerrillas Underground. Select any spaces.

PROCEDURE: In the selected space, either:
●	 Replace one Sepoy, one Activist, or a Protest marker with an
Underground Guerrilla, OR
●	 During Crisis (6.8) in a State or Province with no Raj Control
and room for a Base, place a Revolutionaries Base.

Revolutionaries may choose from Aid, Infiltrate, and
Assassinate Special Activities.

PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:
●	 Activate one Underground Guerrilla and add Revolutionaries
Resources equal to the Population of the space, OR
●	 Pay 1 Resource to flip all Guerrillas there Underground.

EXAMPLE of Aid. The Revolutionaries select both the United
Provinces and Bihar for Aid. They first flip Active one Guerrilla
in the United Provinces and gain 2 Resources. Then, they pay 1
Resource to flip Underground the three Active Guerrillas in Bihar.

EXAMPLE of Revolutionaries Infiltrate. India is in Crisis and
Revolutionaries select Sind for Infiltrate. Although India is in
Crisis, and Sind does not have Raj Control, Revolutionaries
may not place a Base here because with a Population of 1, Sind
may only hold a single Base. Instead, they replace the Muslim
League Activist with an Underground Guerrilla.

Gandhi ~ Rules

4.5.3 Assassinate. Assassinate eliminates adversary pieces.
Select one space selected for Revolutionaries Unrest (3.4.4).
PROCEDURE: In the selected space, remove any one Active
piece (exception: not Gandhi).
UNITY: If a NV piece were removed, shift Unity –1.
PLAY NOTE: Unlike during Attack, during Assassinate the
Revolutionaries could choose to remove a Troop or Base even
if other pieces remain!

5.0 EVENTS
Each Event bears a title, italicized flavor text, and Event text.
Flavor text provides historical interest and has no effect on play.

5.1 Executing Events

When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally (sometimes involving actions or decisions by other
Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction
makes all selections involved in implementing the text, such as
which pieces are affected.
5.1.1 Event Guidelines. Where Event text contradicts the rules,
the Event takes precedence. However:
●	 Events never place pieces that are not Available (1.4.1); they
remove rather than replace if the replacement is not available.
●	 An Event may place any Protest, regardless of Restraint
(1.10).
●	 Events may not violate stacking:
●	 The maximum number of total Bases per space is equal
to its Population (1.4.2).
●	 No more than one Protest marker may occupy any space.
●	 Troops may never be placed in States.
●	 No more than one Strike marker may occupy any Railway.
5.1.2 Spaces. Select space(s) for Events where as much of the
Event text as possible can be carried out. If even per the above
not all of an executed Event’s text can be carried out, implement
that which can. The active Faction may select from among applicable spaces if there is a choice.

EXAMPLE of Assassinate. Revolutionaries selected the United
Provinces for Unrest, which makes the space eligible for Assassinate. They target the Raj Troop, removing it to Available.

5.1.3 ‘Arrested’ vs. ‘Removed’. If an Event specifies that
Gandhi or Activists are arrested (whether Active or Inactive),
move affected pieces to the Jail box. If an Event specifies that
pieces are removed, move them to their Faction’s Available box.
Only move pieces to the Out of Play box if specifically directed
by the Event text.
5.1.4 Event Reminders. When executing an Event, remember
that:
●	 Troops may never be placed or moved into States (1.4.2).
●	 Activists placed in Protest spaces or on Railways are Active
(1.4.3)
●	 When placing an Unrest marker on a Railway, place a Strike
marker instead.
●	 Muslim States may only be placed in Provinces (not Cities
or States).
●	 Ignore instructions to shift Restraint or Unity below 1 or
above 5.
●	 When executing an Event that is similar to an Operation or
Special Activity, only implement what is specified by the
Event text.
EXAMPLE: The unshaded Event text for card #11 says to “arrest
Gandhi”. Do not also shift Restraint or place Protest markers,
as would occur during Raj Assault (3.2.4), Treaty (4.2.1), or
Govern (4.2.2).

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules

5.2 Dual Use

All Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text
to carry out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the
Raj Faction, and the shaded text often favors the Nonviolent and
Revolutionaries Factions, a player may select either text option.

6.0 CAMPAIGN ROUNDS
Conduct a Campaign Round in the sequence of phases below
as each Campaign card is played. If final (2.4.1), end the game
and determine victory (7.3).

6.1 Victory Phase

If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends;
determine victory (7.3). If no Faction has met its Victory condition, continue with the Campaign Round. After conducting
the final Campaign card’s Round (2.4.2), determine victory per
7.3, regardless of the number of Factions that have met their
Victory condition.

6.2 Resources Phase

Follow these steps to adjust Raj and Revolutionaries Resources,
to a maximum of 50 (1.8).
6.2.1 Railway Strikes. Congress places a Strike marker on each
Railway with a Protest marker, with more Activists than cubes,
or that is adjacent to a City with no Raj Control. If there are
insufficient Strike markers Available, Congress selects which
eligible Railways will receive Strike markers.
6.2.2 Raj Earnings. Add the value of Strike-free Railways to
Raj Resources (40 less the Econ value of Railways with Strike
markers). Then, subtract 2 Raj Resources for each NV piece
(Activists plus Gandhi) in Jail.
6.2.3 Revolutionaries Earnings. Add twice the total number of
Revolutionaries Bases on the map to Revolutionaries Resources.

6.3 Support Phase

6.3.1 Imperialism. Raj may spend Resources to build Support
in up to four spaces: Cities and Provinces each with Raj Control, Troops, and Sepoys. Every 3 Resources spent removes one
Unrest marker, or—once no Unrest—shifts the space one level
towards Active Support, up to two levels per space.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Mountbatten is the current Viceroy, Imperialism
costs 2 Resources per marker removed or level shifted.
Then, release two Activists from Jail to Available for every space
selected for Imperialism. Raj may select the combination of
Congress and/or Muslim League Activists to release. Finally, if
Gandhi is in Jail, release him to any space with no Raj Control.

23

PLAY NOTE: Unlike during Govern (4.2.2), Raj may buy
Imperialism in spaces with Active adversaries during the Support Phase, but (unlike during Govern) needs both Troops and
Sepoys present and may not select States.
6.3.2 Constructive Programme. Congress then the Muslim
League may shift a combined total number of Cities and/or Provinces up to Unity with their own pieces and no Raj Control. Shift
each selected space up to two levels towards Active Opposition.
6.3.3 Pakistan Movement. The Muslim League may place a
Base in any one non-Railway space with no Raj Control.
6.3.4 Secret Societies. Revolutionaries may place a Base in any
one non-Railway space with no Raj Control.
6.3.5 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.2),
end the game and determine victory (7.3).

6.4 Redeploy Phase

Redeploy forces as follows.
Important: Adjust Raj Control continually during the Redeploy Phase.
6.4.1 New Colonial Administration. Discard the Campaign
card in the British Viceroy of India box. Move the Campaign
card that triggered this Campaign Round from the Current Card
box to the British Viceroy of India box, to become the new
Viceroy. The new Viceroy’s capabilities take immediate effect
and cancel the capabilities of the previous Viceroy.
6.4.2 Raj Redeploy. Raj may move Troops to Provinces with
Raj Control and to any Cities and Railways. Raj may also move
Sepoys to Provinces with Raj Control, and any Cities, Railways,
and States. Raj must pay 2 Resources for each Troop remaining
in a Province or on a Railway. Finally, remove from the map
all cubes from Provinces with no Raj Control and all but one
Troop from each City.
Important: Raj cubes may exit Protest spaces during Redeploy. Troops may not enter States.
6.4.3 Congress Redeploy. Congress must move any Congress
Activists on Railways, and may move other Congress Activists
and Gandhi, to non-Railway spaces with no Raj Control.
6.4.4 Muslim League Redeploy. The Muslim League must
move any Muslim League Activists on Railways, and may move
other Muslim League Activists, to non-Railway spaces with no
Raj Control or any space with a Muslim League Base.
6.4.5 Revolutionaries Redeploy. Revolutionaries must move
Guerrillas on Railways, and may move other Guerrillas, to
non-Railway spaces with no Raj Control or any space with a
Revolutionaries Base.

Gandhi ~ Rules

6.5 Reset Phase

Then, prepare for the next card as follows in the order listed:
1.	 Remove all Protest markers from the map and return them to
the Protest marker holding boxes next to the Restraint track.
Flip all Activists to their Inactive side.
2.	 Remove one Unrest marker from each space without
Guerrillas. Flip all Guerillas to their Underground side.
3.	 Remove all Strike markers.
4.	 Reset both Restraint and Unity to the number of Campaign
cards remaining in the Event deck.
5.	 Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1). Reveal the draw deck’s
new top card.
Important: During Reset, only remove one Unrest, and only
from spaces without Guerrillas. Leave Unrest markers in all
spaces with one or more Guerrillas.

6.6 Restraint Track

The Restraint track measures the escalation of
conflict during the course of a campaign. When
Restraint is high, factions are restrained by political
pressure, internal disagreements over policy, or
local factors. When Restraint is low, the conflict has escalated
and more aggressive actions, such as use of government force,
widespread protest, or acts of terror are more common.
Restraint has several impacts on gameplay:
OPERATIONS (3.0):
●	 The current Restraint value is the cost of Raj Operations that
involve Sepoys (exception: per current Viceroy capability,
2.5.1) and Revolutionaries Unrest Operations (3.4.4).
●	 Restraint is the number of spaces without Gandhi or Protest
that Congress may select for Operations (3.3).
PROTEST MARKERS:
●	 The total number of Available Protest markers is determined
by the current Restraint value—only markers to the right and
above the box containing the Restraint marker are Available.
Protest markers already on the map are not affected by
changes in Restraint.
CRISIS:
●	 If Unity and Restraint are both one, India is in a state of Crisis
(6.8).
RESTRAINT SHIFTS: Immediately decrease Restraint (shift
marker down) or increase Restraint (shift marker up) as the
following apply:
●	 Operations. NV Non-Cooperation (3.3.4) and Revolutionaries
Unrest (3.4.4) Operations shift Restraint –1. Shift only once
per Operation, regardless of the total number of spaces
selected.
●	 Special Activities. NV Negotiate Special Activity (4.3.1
4.4.1) shifts Restraint +1.
●	 Events. Several Events (5.0) shift Restraint.
●	 Gandhi Arrested. When Gandhi is arrested during Raj
Assault (3.2.4), Treaty (4.2.1), or Govern (4.2.2) shift
Restraint –1 at the end of the Raj turn.

●	 Reset Phase. During the Reset Phase of each Campaign
Round (6.5), Restraint is reset to the number of Campaign
cards remaining in the Draw deck.

6.7 Unity Track

The Unity Track shows the current level of animosity among the various religious and ethnic groups
that comprise India, particularly the level of tension
or cooperation between Hindus and Muslims. A
high level shows these groups uniting against a common foe
and adopting a nationalist, rather than an ethnic or religious,
Indian identity. A low level of Unity shows sectarian divisions
splitting factions, and a shift towards communalism leading to
the eventual partition of South Asia.
Unity has several impacts on gameplay:
OPERATIONS (3.0):
●	 Unity is the number of spaces without Muslim League Bases
that the Muslim League may select for Operations (3.3).
●	 Unity is the number of Muslim League Activists or
Revolutionaries Guerrillas needed to build a Base during
Rally Operations (3.3.1, 3.4.1).
●	 Unity is the total number of Muslim League Activists that
Congress may move during Congress Demonstrate (3.3.2).
SUPPORT PHASE (6.3):
●	 Congress and the Muslim League may shift a combined
number of spaces up to Unity towards Active Opposition
during the Support Phase of each Campaign Round.
CRISIS
●	 If Unity and Restraint are both one, India is in a state of Crisis
(6.8).
UNITY SHIFTS: Immediately shift the Unity marker up or down
on the track as the following apply:
●	 Out of Play. Each time Congress or the Muslim League
moves an Activist belong to the other NV Faction from Out
of Play to Available (3.3.1), shift Unity +1.
●	 Special Activities. NV Factions shift Unity –1 during the
Persuade Special Activity (4.4.3) if a NV piece is removed.
Revolutionaries shift Unity –1 if any NV pieces were
removed during the Assassinate Special Activity (4.5.3).
●	 Events. Several Events shift Unity (5.0).
●	 Reset Phase. During the Reset Phase of each Campaign
Round (6.5), Unity is reset to the number of Campaign cards
remaining in the Draw deck.

6.8 Crisis

Crisis is triggered each and every time both
Unity and Restraint are one. A Crisis ends the
moment either Unity and/or Restraint is greater
than one. In this way, India may slip in and out
of Crisis multiple times during the flow of play.

If a Crisis is triggered during a turn (whether by Operations,
Special Activity, or Event), at the end of that turn the Raj player
may move up to a die roll of cubes from Out of Play (1.3.13) to

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules
any spaces (exception: no Troops may move into any States).
Raj may do this even if the Crisis ended during the same turn.
Crisis is automatically triggered during the Reset Phase of the
Campaign Round leading into the final Campaign of the game.
Before any Faction acts on the first card of the final Campaign,
Raj may move a die roll of cubes from Out of Play to any spaces
(no Troops to States).
In addition, during a Crisis, the following immediately apply:
●	 Raj may select up to two spaces during Martial Law Special
Activity (4.2.3).
●	 Congress may select spaces with Raj Control for NonCooperation Operations (3.3.4).
●	 The Muslim League Infiltrate Special Activity (4.4.2) may
place a Muslim State (1.3.5) in one Province with a Muslim
League Base and no Raj Control.
●	 Revolutionaries may select spaces that contain both
Congress and Muslim League Activists (even spaces without
Underground Guerrillas) for Unrest Operations (3.4.4).
●	 Revolutionaries Infiltrate Special Activity (4.5.2) may place
a Revolutionaries Base (1.3.5) in one State or Province with
no Raj Control.

7.0 VICTORY
Each Faction has a unique victory condition, covered below.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2),
all players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any single player
does so or if none does by game end, the Faction that reached
the highest victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd highest
comes in 2nd place, and so forth. Ties go to the Muslim League,
then Congress, then Revolutionaries.

7.2 During Campaign Rounds

Check victory at the start of each Campaign Round (6.1) by
comparing the positions of the various victory markers (1.9) to
the thresholds marked on the edge track:
●	 British Raj: Total Support (1.6.2) plus the Population of
Raj-Controlled spaces (1.7) exceeds 38.
●	 Indian National Congress: Total Opposition (1.6.2) exceeds
20.
●	 Muslim League: Total Muslim Opposition (1.6.2) plus twice
the Population of Muslim States (1.3.5) exceeds 14.
●	 Revolutionaries: The Population of spaces with at least one
Unrest marker (1.11) plus the number of Revolutionaries
Bases (1.3.5) exceeds 14.
If any Factions have met their victory condition, the game ends
immediately; determine a winner (7.3). If none have, the game
continues with a Campaign Round (6.0).

25

7.3 After Final Campaign

If the final Campaign Round (2.4.2) is completed without a victory check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory margin
wins. The victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or
short of its victory condition set forth in 7.2.
PLAY NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction
has reached its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
●	 British Raj: Total Support + Population of Raj-Controlled
spaces – 38.
●	 Indian National Congress: Total Opposition – 20.
●	 Muslim League: Total Muslim Opposition + twice the
Population of Muslim States – 14.
●	 Revolutionaries: Population of spaces with Unrest + number
of Revolutionaries Bases – 14.
STOP!
You have read all the rules needed for four players.

8.0 NON-PLAYER FACTIONS
This section governs actions by Factions not represented by a
player. In this way, Gandhi may be played with fewer than four
players, including solitaire. See also the Playbook’s Non-player
(NP) Examples of Play.
PLAY NOTE: Non-player Factions may not act only in their
own direct interest. Like players, they sometimes help, sometimes harm, one another.
Important: If playing solitaire, be sure to read the special
1-player victory conditions (8.10) before you start!

8.1 Non-Player Overview

The actions taken by Non-player (NP) Factions are guided by
several tables and a deck of instruction cards called Arjuna
(“AR-juhn-uh”). When a NP Faction is Eligible, use the NP
Eligibility table (8.2) to determine how it will act on the current
Event card. Generally, NP Factions prefer to execute an Operation plus Special Activity. However, they will instead choose to
execute an Event if it is a Critical Event for their Faction (8.8.1).
If executing an Operation plus Special Activity, draw an Arjuna
card matching the active NP Faction. Use the flowchart on the
card to select an Operation (8.6) and Special Activity (8.7). If
executing an Event (8.8), instead follow the instructions on the
Event card. Use the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to
select spaces where the NP Faction will act.
NP Factions follow all player Faction rules, with three important
exceptions:
●	 NP Factions never remove pieces from the map to Available
when lacking pieces for an Operation, Special Activity, or
Event.
●	 NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries do not track or use Resources.
Instead, an Activation Number (8.6.2) governs the total

26

Gandhi ~ Rules

number of spaces where they may Operate. When either NP
Faction Passes (2.3.3), there is no additional effect.
●	 NP Congress places one Protest marker in India at the end
of each Campaign Round (8.9.4).
Important: Arjuna will only tell you what to do. It will not
tell you how to do it or even if its instructions constitute a
legal move given the state of the board and available pieces.
Always carry out Arjuna’s instructions as much as possible.
If Arjuna ever gives you an instruction that cannot be carried out, however, just skip it. Although some Arjuna cards
include reminders, they will not walk you through every step
of an Operation or Special Activity. The rules provide full
instructions.
DESIGN NOTE: Arjuna is the name of the warrior prince who
is the central character in the Bhagavad Gita, a classic Hindu
text drawn from the much longer Indian epic the Mahābhārata.
The Gita’s focus on duty and selfless service was an inspiration
to Gandhi, who often turned to its wisdom in times of doubt.
8.1.1 NP System Components. The Arjuna system is composed
of six components. All but the deck of Arjuna cards can be found
on the double-sided Non-player aid. Together these components
run any NP Factions in play:
●	 NP Eligibility Table (8.2). Use this table to determine what
action a NP Faction will take when Eligible on the Current
card.
●	 Arjuna Deck (8.3). The Arjuna deck is composed of six
instruction cards for each NP Faction in play. Use the Arjuna
deck when a NP Faction executes an Operation (8.6) or a
Special Activity (8.7).
●	 Space Selection Priorities Tables (one for each NP Faction,
8.4.1). Use each NP Faction’s table to select spaces when
that NP Faction executes an Operation (8.6), Special Activity
(8.7), or Event (8.8).
●	 Move Priorities Table (8.4.2). Use this table during Operations
that move pieces (i.e., Raj Sweep, NV Demonstrate, and
Revolutionaries March).
●	 Adversary Priorities Table (8.5). Use this table to determine
the order that markers and adversary pieces are removed by
a NP Faction.
●	 Random Spaces Map (8.1.2). Use this map to select a
random space when there are several options.
8.1.2 Random Cities, Provinces, and States. If several candidate Cities, Provinces, or States have equal priority for a
NP Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select one using the
Random Spaces map:
●	 The Random Spaces map is divided into six regions (shaded
red, green, blue, yellow, purple, and orange). Each region
contains six Cities, Provinces, and/or States (Note: some
regions share spaces).
●	 Roll two dice. The first die indicates the region; the second
die indicates the space selected within that region.

●	 If the selected space is not eligible for the given Operation,
Special Activity, or Event, check the next space in turn: space
follows space
, space
follows space
,
follows
, and so forth.
Example: NP Revolutionaries are directed to select a space for
an Unrest Operation. Two dice are rolled: a
and a . The
first die indicates the blue region; the second die indicates the
East Bengal space. If East Bengal were not eligible for Unrest
(i.e., it did not contain an Underground Guerrilla), the next space
selected would be
(Calcutta), then
(Sind), then
(Gujarat), and so forth.
8.1.3 Random Railways. If both Railways and other spaces
are equal candidates, choose Railways last. If several Railways
are candidates:
●	 First, select the Railway with the highest Econ.
●	 Then, from among Railways with the highest Econ, select
the one adjacent to a Random City (8.1.2).
●	 Finally, with an equal chance die roll.
Place Strikes only on Railways without Strikes already.
Important: NP Factions only place forces or Strikes on
Railways if Raj is a player Faction.
8.1.4 Non-player Faction Specific Instructions.
NP RAJ:
●	 Passing: When NP Raj Passes (2.3.3), there is no further
effect.
●	 Troops Caught in Muslim States: When a Muslim State
marker is placed in a space with Troops (4.4.1, 4.4.2, 5.0),
use the Place Cubes column of the Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1) to select the destination space among all Cities
for each Troop.
●	 Crisis in India: When a Crisis is triggered (6.8), NP Raj
will place Troops first, using the Place Cubes column of the
Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1).
●	 Release Gandhi: NP Raj always refuses to release Gandhi
from Jail when requested during Congress Satyagraha (4.3.2).
NP CONGRESS:
●	 Passing: When NP Congress passes (2.3.3), move one
Congress Activist from Out of Play to Available (if one is
available in Out of Play).
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE:
●	 Passing: When NP Muslim League Passes (2.3.3), move
one Muslim League Activist from Out of Play to Available
(if one is available in Out of Play).
NP REVOLUTIONARIES:
●	 Passing: When NP Revolutionaries Pass (2.3.3), there is no
further effect.
8.1.5 Non-player Definitions. The following terms are used to
implement NP Faction instructions:
●	 Eligible: A space is eligible for an Operation or Special
Activity if it meets the selection requirements for that action

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

27

Gandhi ~ Rules
3.0, 4.0, 5.0), and the action may be carried out in that space
given the state of the board.
●	 Get: Move so as to have as many pieces in the destination
as specified in the instruction including those pieces already
there.
EXAMPLE: The NP Raj Arjuna card AA Deploy instructions
read: “Get 3 Troops to each selected City, then add Sepoys to
place up to 6 cubes.” Delhi is selected as a space for Deploy;
there are already two Troops there, so NP Raj adds one additional
Troop to make three Troops total in Delhi, then adds five Sepoys.
If only three Sepoys were Available, then place all three.
Important: Pay attention to these two terms, Arjuna uses
them frequently!
8.1.6 British Viceroys. If Raj is a NP Faction, the current British
Viceroy modifies NP Raj play as follows:
●	 Lord Chelmsford: The Activation Number (8.6.2) during
Assault is
.
●	 Lord Irwin: The Activation Number (8.6.2) during Sweep
is .
●	 Lord Linlithgow: Do not place Unrest markers during
Martial Law (4.2.3). In addition, NP Raj may select spaces
without Unrest for Martial Law.
●	 Lord Wavell: Sweep into one space selected for Assault
(3.2.4, 8.6.3).
●	 Lord Willingdon: The Activation Number (8.6.2) during
Deploy is .
●	 Lord Mountbatten: Does not affect NP Raj (ignore if current
British Viceroy).
●	 Lord Reading: Does not affect NP Raj (ignore if current
British Viceroy).

●	 Execute an Operation (8.6) plus Special Activity (8.7).
If the NP Faction is 2nd Eligible (2.3.4), determine its action
as follows:
●	 If all of the following conditions apply, the active NP Faction
will Pass (2.3.3):
●	 The active NP Faction is guaranteed to be the 1st Eligible
Faction on the next Event card, AND
●	 The Upcoming Event card is a Critical Event (8.8.1),
AND
●	 The Current Event is not a Critical Event (8.8.1) OR it is a
Critical Event but the active NP Faction cannot execute it
(e.g., the Event is not effective, or the 1st Eligible Faction
executed an Operation only). Otherwise,
●	 If the 1st Eligible Faction chose an Operation plus Special
Activity and the Current Event card is effective (8.8.3) for
the active NP Faction, choose the Event. Otherwise,
●	 If the NP Faction is guaranteed to be 1st Eligible on the
Upcoming card, choose to Pass (2.3.3). Otherwise,
●	 If the 1st Eligible executed an Operation only or if the Current
Event is not effective (8.8.3), choose a Limited Operation
(2.3.5). Otherwise,
●	 Execute an Operation (8.6) plus Special Activity (8.7).
PLAY NOTE: If a Faction’s icon is underlined on the Event
card (with a rifle for Raj and Revolutionaries, with an arrow
for Congress and the Muslim League), this is a Critical Event
(8.8.1) for that Faction.

Important: Unlike other games in the COIN Series, a NP Faction’s options are subject to the rules of the Sequence of Play
as detailed in 2.0. NP Factions will choose Operation only or
a Limited Operation if directed by the NP Eligibility table.
8.2.1 Options When NP is 1st or 2nd Eligible. NP Factions
have the same choices as player Factions when Eligible on the
Current card (2.3). Follow the steps below to determine how the
Eligible NP Faction will act. This same information is summarized on the NP Eligibility Table on the Non-player Aid Chart.
PROCEDURE. If the NP Faction is 1st Eligible (2.3), determine
its action as follows:
●	 If the Current Event is a Critical Event (8.8.1) for that Faction
and is effective (8.8.3), choose the Event (8.6). Otherwise,
●	 If the Current Event is a Critical Event for the next Eligible
Faction (either player or Non-player Faction), choose
Operation only (2.3.4). Otherwise,
●	 If the NP Faction is guaranteed to be 1st Eligible on the
Upcoming card and the Event on the Upcoming Card
is a Critical Event for that Faction, choose Pass (2.3.3).

Gandhi ~ Rules

Reset Phase of each Campaign Round (8.9.4), shuffle together
the Arjuna cards for all the NP Factions in play into a single deck.
PLAY NOTE: If desired, keep the Arjuna cards for each NP
Faction in a separate stack. When instructed to reveal an
Arjuna card, reveal a card from the Eligible Faction’s stack.
PROCEDURE. When the NP Eligibility Table (8.2.1) determines
that a NP Faction will execute an Operation (with or without a
Special Activity), use Arjuna to determine the specific Operation:
1.	 Move the top Arjuna card to the bottom of the deck, face-up.
2.	 Continue moving cards to the bottom of the deck, one by
one, until a card matching the active NP Faction is showing.
Always return cards to the bottom face-up.
3.	 Read the selected card from the top down, following each
instruction in turn:
●	 Blue boxes check conditions to determine what action the
NP Faction will take. If the condition in the box is true,
follow the green arrow. If false, follow the red arrow.
Draw a New Card: return to Step #1 above to draw
●	
a new card and repeat this procedure.
●	
Flip the Card: flip this card over to its back side,
and continue from Step #3 above.
●	 Operation: Follow the directions to execute the specified
Operation, using the specified column of the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) or the Move Priorities
table (8.4.2) as instructed. Text in bold identifies the
column of the Space Selection Priorities table to use.
When the Operation is complete, continue to the next
instruction (either a Special Activity or Stop). If no spaces
are eligible for the specified Operation, return to Step #1
above to draw a new Arjuna card. If executing a Limited
Op (2.3.5) or Operation only (2.3.4), skip any instruction
to implement a Special Activity.
	 The following symbols are used in Operations instruction
boxes:
	 Execute the Operation using this instruction first.
	 Use this insttruction next (and so on).
	 Perform this step after all spaces for the Operation
have been selected.
	 Only perform this step if the condition after the
checkmark is met.
●	 Special Activity: If allowed by the Sequence of Play
(8.2) to execute a Special Activity, execute the first
Special Activity that may be implemented, following the
directions in the box (8.7). When the Special Activity
is complete, continue to the next instruction (either an
Operation or Stop).
	 The following symbols are used in Special Activity
instruction boxes:
	 Attempt to perform this Special Activity first.
	 Attempt to perform this Special Activity next (and
so on).
	 Execute the Special Activity using this instruction first.
	 Use this instruction next (and so on).

●	

	 Only perform this step if the condition after the
checkmark is met.
Stop: Once reaching this symbol, the NP Faction’s
turn is over.

PLAY NOTE: It is quite possible that a space may trigger an
Operation via a blue box condition but is itself not selected
during the Operation.

8.4 Space Selection and Move Priorities
Tables

Whenever a NP Faction selects one or more spaces for an
Operation (8.6), Special Activity (8.7), or Event (8.8), use that
Faction’s Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). Whenever a
NP Faction executes a move Operation (i.e., Raj Sweep, NV
Demonstrate, or Revolutionaries March), use the Move Priorities table (8.4.2).
8.4.1 Space Selection Priorities Table. A NP Faction’s Space
Selection Priorities table is used to select from among eligible
spaces during Operations, Special Activities, and Events. A space
is eligible if it may be selected for a given Operation, Special
Activity, or Event.
EXAMPLES of Eligible Spaces: NP Muslim League will execute
Non-Cooperation. Only spaces with Protest, Muslim League
Activists, and no Raj Control are eligible.
The unshaded text of Event 45, Pakistan Declaration Published in London, reads: “Add 1 Unrest marker to up to 2
Muslim spaces, then remove 1 Base from among the selected
spaces.” Only Muslim spaces are eligible for this Event.
PROCEDURE: First, determine the type of action the NP Faction
will execute to determine the column to use on the Space Selection Priorities table. During an Operation or Special Activity,
use the column specified by the Arjuna card (8.3). During an
Event, use the column that matches the activity specified in the
Event text (8.8.5). If an Event specifies more than one type of
effective action (8.8.3), use the leftmost column on the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.8.5).
When executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event select
each space one at a time:
1.	 Start at the top of the column and read down. For each row
with a dot in that column, check its condition against all
eligible spaces. If no spaces meet the condition, skip that row
and continue to the next. If only one eligible space meets this
condition, execute the Operation, Special Activity, or Event
in this space. Otherwise,
2.	 If more than one eligible space meets this condition, continue
down the column to the next condition that is met. Continue
to skip conditions that are not met. If only one eligible space
meets both the original condition and the new condition,
execute the action in this space (as in Step #1).
3.	 Continue this process, checking each row below and apply
all meeting conditions, until a single space is selected.
Repeat this process from Step #1 for each space to be selected.

Gandhi ~ Rules
PLAY NOTE: It is usually faster to note the spaces on the board
that are eligible for the action first, and then use the Space
Selection Priorities table to select from among those spaces
(ignoring other spaces that are not eligible).

EXAMPLE of Selecting a Space for
an Operation: NP
Congress is directed by Arjuna to execute Civil Disobedience. Restraint is
3 and there are two
Available Protest
markers. Four
spaces are eligible
(spaces with Congress Activists):
United Provinces,
Bihar, West Bengal, and Central India Agency. Arjuna directs
NP Congress to place Protest markers using the Place Protests
column of the NP Congress Space Selection Priorities table
(8.4.1). Looking down the column, the first row with a dot reads:
“not at Active Opposition.” Three eligible spaces remain (all
but United Provinces). Continue down the column to the next
dot: “2-Pop.” This eliminates Central India Agency from the
candidates, leaving two eligible spaces. Continue to the next
dot: “non-Muslim space.” Only Bihar meets all three conditions
(i.e., it alone is a “2-Pop, non-Muslim space not at Active Opposition”): the first Available Protest marker is placed in Bihar
and both Activists there are flipped to their Active side. One
Available Protest marker remains to be placed, so the process
is started over. Now, three spaces are eligible (Bihar may not
be selected again). Both Central India Agency and West Bengal
are both spaces “not at Active Opposition” (meeting the first
condition), but only West Bengal meets the second condition,
“2-Pop.” The last Available Protest marker is placed in West
Bengal, and the lone Activist there is flipped to its Active side.

8.4.2 Move Priorities Table. The Move Priorities table is used
during NP Raj Sweep, NP NV Demonstrate, and NP Revolutionaries March Operations.
PROCEDURE:
A.	During NP Raj Sweep and NP NV Demonstrate Operations,
start by selecting a destination space using the active
Faction’s Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). For NP
Revolutionaries March Operations, start by selecting an
origin: the space with the most Guerrillas not yet selected
as a destination (choose randomly if more than one).
B.	Next, during NP Raj Sweep and NP NV Demonstrate
Operations, select an origin: the space with the most cubes or
Activists, not yet selected as a destination, from which pieces
could reach the selected destination (choose randomly if more
than one). During NP Revolutionaries March Operations,
select a destination space using the Revolutionaries Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1).
●	 Then, read down the active NP Faction’s column,
implementing each instruction marked by a dot, as much as
possible.
C.	Finally, check to see if another origin space or destination
space will be selected.
PLAY NOTE: See 8.6 for detailed NP Raj Sweep, NP NV
Demonstrate, and NP Revolutionaries March Operations
instructions.
Important: It may be that no pieces are eligible to move out
of an origin space. When this happens, skip this origin and
select another (the next space with the most friendly cubes,
Activists, or Guerrillas not yet selected as a destination).

8.5 Adversary Priorities Pieces Table

When the active NP Faction is instructed to remove or replace
adversary pieces, first select the space (8.4.1), then select the
pieces within that space to be replaced or removed.
8.5.1 Selecting Pieces. The Adversary Priorities table specifies
the order in which pieces are removed. Only remove a piece if
allowed by the specific Operation, Special Activity, or Event text.
8.5.2 Replace Then Remove. NP Factions replace adversary
pieces before removing them, when given a choice.
8.5.3 Never Own Pieces. When given a choice: NP Congress
and NP Muslim League never replace or remove Protest markers,
NP Muslim League never removes Muslim State markers; and
NP Revolutionaries never remove Unrest markers.
PLAY NOTE: The prohibition against removing Protest primarily applies to Events. Note that during NV Negotiate and
Congress Satyagraha Special Activities, removing a Protest
marker is a required part of the activity.
8.5.4 Target Faction. If multiple Factions’ pieces may be removed, use the Adversary Priorities table to select the first piece
affected, then target that Faction’s remaining pieces to the extent
required by 1.4.4. If multiple pieces may be removed within the
same priority, choose randomly.

tions, and so forth. For each, carry out the instructions as much
as possible.
PROCEDURE: Consult the Space Selection Priorities table
(8.4.1) for the active NP Faction to select the first space for the
Operation. Once a space has been selected, execute the Operation in that space. Only perform instructions marked by the
symbol if the conditions are met. If the NP Faction may select
additional spaces (8.6.1), return to the Space Selection Priorities
table to select another space. Continue selecting spaces until the
maximum number of spaces have been selected (8.6.1), or no
more spaces are eligible for that Operation.
After an Operation has been executed in all selected spaces,
complete any further instructions for that Operation marked
by the symbol.
EXAMPLE of Instructions: NP Muslim League executes Rally.
After placing pieces on the map, move a Muslim League Activist
from Out of Play to Available.
If no spaces are eligible for the Operation, instead draw a new
Arjuna card (8.3) to select another Operation. In this case, if a
Special Activity has already been executed, ignore any instructions to execute another Special Activity on the new Arjuna card.

EXAMPLE of Removing Adversaries: Raj and Muslim League are
both NP Factions, and Revolutionaries are a player Faction. NP
Raj is active and selects Operation and Special Activity. Arjuna
directs NP Raj to execute Assault (8.6.3), and the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1) selects Punjab. With eight Sepoys there,
NP Raj may remove up to four adversary pieces. NP Raj targets
Gandhi first (along with any Congress Activists with him, 1.4.4),
sending both to Jail. Next, NP Raj targets the Guerrilla because
Revolutionaries are a player Faction. Lastly, NP Raj sends the
lone Muslim League Activist to Jail. With four pieces removed
(and no adversaries remaining in any case), the Assault Operation is done in this space.
Later during the same turn, NP Raj later selects Punjab as
a space for Govern Special Activity (8.7.1) and will execute
Imperialism here. It would remove the Unrest marker first, then
remove the Muslim State marker.

8.6 NP Operations
Important: NP Factions always follow all rules when executing an Operation (exception: NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries
do not spend Resources; see 8.6.2). Never select a space for
an Operation if that space is not eligible for that Operation
(8.1.5). If an Arjuna instruction contradicts the rules, skip it!
PLAY NOTE: Section 8.6 details procedures for NP Operations
and can be referenced by the player as needed during play if
the Player Aid and Arjuna are insufficiently clear.
When directed by Arjuna to execute an Operation (8.3), follow
the directions in the Operation instructions box on the selected
Arjuna card. Implement all instructions first, then instruc-

Important: Once a space is selected for an Operation, complete actions in that space before selecting the next space for
the Operation.
8.6.1 Total Spaces for Operations. Unless executing a Limited
Operation (2.3.5), a NP Faction will execute an Operation in as
many spaces as allowed, given each NP Faction’s space selection
constraints and the state of the board. If executing a Limited
Operation (2.3.5), a NP Faction will only perform the chosen
Operation in the first space selected.
●	 NP Raj will Operate with all Troops and with Sepoys in a
limited total number of spaces, determined by the Operation’s
Activation Number (8.6.2).
●	 NP Congress will Operate in the maximum spaces allowed
by Gandhi, Protest, and Restraint (3.3).
●	 NP Muslim League will Operate in the maximum spaces
allowed by Muslim League Bases and Unity (3.3).
●	 NP Revolutionaries will Operate in a limited total number
of spaces, determined by the Operation’s Activation Number
(8.6.2).
8.6.2 NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries Activation Number.
Since they do not use Resources, NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries do not pay for Operations. Intead, they use an Activation
Number to determine the maximum number of spaces they may
select for Operations.
For NP Raj the Activation Number is always equal to Restraint
(exception: unless modified by the current Viceroy; see below),
and only limits the total number of spaces where Sepoys may
Operate. For NP Revolutionaries, the selected Arjuna card determines the Activation Number for any Operation selected on
that side: either 2, 3, or equal to Restraint.

Gandhi ~ Rules
NP RAJ PROCEDURE:
1.	 Select a space for the Operation using the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1).
2.	 Perform the Operation in that space. Always use Troops and
any Sepoys present if the Activation Number roll for the
Operation has not yet failed.
3.	 If only Troops were used, return to Step #1 above. If Sepoys
were used, roll a die:
●	 If the roll result is less than or equal to the Activation
Number, return to Step #1 above, but only spaces where
Troops can Operate are eligible and only Troops can be
used in those spaces for the rest of this Operation.
●	 If the roll result is greater than the Activation Number,
continue with the Operation: return to Step #1 above.
Both Troops and Sepoys may continue to Operate.
4.	 Once there are no eligible spaces for the Operation (8.4.1),
the Operation is over. Continue with the next instruction on
the current Arjuna card (8.3).
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Willingdon is the current British Viceroy, the
Activation Number for Deploy is 1.
●	 If Lord Irwin is the current British Viceroy, the Activation
Number for Sweep is 1.
●	 If Lord Chelmsford is the current British Viceroy, the
Activation Number for Assault is 1.
NP REVOLUTIONARIES PROCEDURE:
1.	 Select a space for the Operation using the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1).
2.	 Perform the Operation in that space.
3.	 Roll a die:
●	 If the roll result is less than or equal to the Activation
Number, the Operation is over. Continue with the next
instruction on the current Arjuna card (8.3).
●	 If the roll result is greater than the Activation Number,
continue with the Operation: return to Step #1 above.
4.	 Once there are no eligible spaces for the Operation (8.4.1),
the Operation is over. Continue with the next instruction on
the current Arjuna card (8.3), if any.
8.6.3 NP Raj Operations. NP Raj will execute an Operation
as much as possible, given available pieces and the state of the
board. Follow all procedures for the selected Operation (3.2).
NP RAJ DEPLOY (3.2.1) PROCEDURE: Use the Place Cubes
column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select
Cities. In each selected City, add Troops until three Troops total
are in the selected City, then add Sepoys to place up to six cubes
there. After NP Raj fails its Activation Number roll (8.6.2),
continue placing Troops to get three to each City (as much as
possible given Available Troops). After placing pieces, move
two cubes from Out of Play to Available, Troops first.
NP RAJ GARRISON (3.2.2) PROCEDURE: NP Raj never
executes Garrison.

31

NP RAJ SWEEP (3.2.3) PROCEDURE: Use the Move Priorities table (8.4.2). First, select a destination space (instruction A)
using the Sweep column of the Space Selection Priorities table
(8.4.1). Next, select as an origin the space with the most cubes
(instruction B). Keep cubes in the origin as instructed. If Sweeping into a City or Province, get one Troop to the destination
(per 8.1.5, do not move a Troop if one is already in the selected
destination). Next, get 1 Sepoy to the destination (per 8.1.5,
do not move a Sepoy if one is already in the selected destination). Then, add additional cubes until cubes in the destination
exceed Active adversaries (including any Guerrillas that were
Activated during this Sweep Operation) or no more cubes are
eligible to move. Move Sepoys first and add Troops if no more
Sepoys are eligible to move from the selected origin. As each
cube moves, Activate an Underground Guerrilla in the destination if one is present.
After all eligible cubes have moved from the first origin, check
to see if cubes exceed Active adversaries in the destination
(instruction C). If not, return to instruction B to select another
origin space and continue moving cubes to the same destination.
If cubes do exceed Active adversaries in the destination, and
if NP Raj may select another destination space (8.6.1), return
to instruction A to select another destination and instruction B
to select an origin space (a space already selected as an origin
may be selected again unless it has already been selected as a
destination). Use the Move Priorities table (8.4.2) to select the
cubes that will move to the new destination. Continue selecting
additional origin spaces as needed, and continue to select new
destination spaces until no eligible destination spaces remain.
After the Activation Number roll has failed (8.6.2), continue to
Sweep into eligible spaces with Troops only.
Lose no Raj Control in all origins. If no pieces are eligible to
move to a selected destination, skip this destination space and
select a new one.
Lastly, in all spaces with cubes that were not selected as destination spaces, Sweep in place (3.2.3) to Activate Guerrillas. Use
all Troops but only use Sepoys if allowed per 8.6.2. If Sepoys
are eligible to Sweep in place, select the spaces with the most
Support first.
Important: Protest spaces may not be selected as origins
during Raj Sweep (3.2.3).
PLAY NOTE: Once the Activation Number roll has failed, only
check to see if Troops that have not moved yet will Sweep. To
speed play, identify the Troops that can move, then choose
destination spaces from among the spaces each Troop can
reach. Remember that Troops that do not move may still Sweep
in place to Activate Guerrillas. NP Raj will Sweep in place to
Activate as many Guerrillas possible, even if that results in
removing Raj Control.
NP RAJ ASSAULT (3.2.4) PROCEDURE: Use the Remove or
Replace column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1)
to select each Assault space first, and then use the Adversary
Priorities table (8.5) to select the pieces to remove. Only select
spaces with both cubes and Active adversaries (i.e., where As-

sault would have some effect). In each selected space, use both
Troops and Sepoys. After the Activation Number roll has failed
(8.6.2), continue to Assault in eligible spaces with Troops only.
VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Wavell is the current Viceroy, NP Raj will first
Sweep into one space eligible for Assault, using the Move
Priorities table (8.4.2) as for a Sweep Operation. Skip
selected spaces that are not eligible for Assault. After
Sweeping, select the destination as the first space for the
Assault Operation.
8.6.4 NP Congress Operations. NP Congress will execute
an Operation as much as possible, given available pieces and
the state of the board. Follow all procedures for the selected
Operation (3.3).
NP CONGRESS RALLY (3.3.1) PROCEDURE: Select spaces
using the Place Activists column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). After placing pieces, release prisoners if 3 or
more Congress Activists are in Jail (release Congress Activists
first); otherwise move one Congress Activist from Out of Play
to Available.
NP CONGRESS DEMONSTRATE (3.3.2) PROCEDURE: Use
the Move Priorities table (8.4.2). First, select a destination space
(instruction A) using the Demonstrate column of the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). Next, select as an origin the
space with the most Congress Activists (instruction B). Keep
Activists in the origin as instructed. Move one Congress Activist
to the destination. Add additional Activists until all Activists in
the destination (Congress plus Muslim League) equal or exceed
cubes in the destination, or no more Congress Activists are
eligible to move from this origin. If present in origin spaces,
bring Muslim League Activists along with Congress Activists
up to Unity (3.3.2).
After all eligible Congress Activists have moved from the first
origin, check to see if Activists (Congress plus Muslim League)
equal or exceed cubes in the destination (instruction C). If not,
return to instruction B to select another origin space and continue
moving Activists to the same destination. If Activists equal or
exceed cubes in the destination, and if NP Congress may select
another destination space (8.6.1), return to instruction A to select
another destination and instruction B to select an origin space (a
space already selected as an origin may be selected again unless
it has already been selected as a destination), and move Activists as instructed. Continue selecting additional origin spaces as
needed, and continue to select new destination spaces until NP
Congress has selected the maximum spaces for this Operation
(8.6.1) or no Congress Activists remain eligible to move (8.4.2).
Place an Available Protest marker when moving into a space with
no Raj Control. If no pieces are eligible to move to a selected
destination, skip this destination space and select a new one.
NP CONGRESS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE (3.3.3) PROCEDURE: Select spaces using the Place Protests column of the
Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) and place Available
Protests in those spaces.

If Raj is a player Faction, after placing all Protests check if there
are three or more Congress Activists in any space(s) selected
for Civil Disobedience. If so, get one Activist from there onto
the Railway with the highest Econ value and no Activist already
(if more than one Civil Disobedience space qualifies, select one
at random).
NP CONGRESS NON-COOPERATION (3.3.4) PROCEDURE:
Execute the Operation in every eligible space (8.4.1).
PLAY NOTE: During a Crisis (6.8), remember that Protest
spaces with Raj Control are eligible for Congress Non-Cooperation Operations (3.3.4).
8.6.5 NP Muslim League Operations. The Muslim League
will execute an Operation as much as possible, given available
pieces and the state of the board. Follow all procedures for the
selected Operation (3.3).
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE RALLY (3.3.1) PROCEDURE: First,
place Bases in all eligible spaces where Muslim League Activists
exceed Unity (8.4.1); use the Place Bases column of the Space
Selection Priorities table if there are more eligible spaces than
Available Bases. Then, select spaces to place Activists using
the Place Activists column of the Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1). After placing pieces, release prisoners if 3 or more
Muslim League Activists are in Jail (release Muslim League
Activists first); otherwise move one Muslim League Activist
from Out of Play to Available.
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE DEMONSTRATE (3.3.2) PROCEDURE: Use the Move Priorities table (8.4.2). First, select a
destination space (instruction A) using the Demonstrate column
of the Space Selection Priorities table. Next, select as an origin
the space with the most Muslim League Activists (instruction
B). Keep Activists in the origin as instructed. Move one Muslim
League Activist to the destination. Add additional Activists until
all Activists in the destination (Muslim League plus Congress)
equal or exceed cubes there, or no more Muslim League Activists are eligible to move from this origin.
After all eligible Muslim League Activists have moved from
the first origin, check to see if Activists (Muslim League plus
Congress) equal or exceed cubes in the destination (instruction
C). If not, return to instruction B to select another origin space
and continue moving Activists to the same destination. If Activists equal or exceed cubes in the destination, and if NP Muslim
League may select another destination space (8.6.1), return to
instruction A to select another destination and instruction B to
select an origin space (a space already selected as an origin
may be selected again unless it has already been selected as a
destination), and move Activists as instructed. Continue selecting additional origin spaces as needed, and continue to select
new destination spaces until NP Muslim League has selected
the maximum spaces for this Operation (8.6.1) or no Muslim
League Activists remain eligible to move (8.4.2).
For all destinations, place an Available Protest marker when
moving into a space with no Raj Control. If no pieces are eligible
to move to a selected destination, skip this destination space
and select a new one.

NP MUSLIM LEAGUE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE (3.3.3) PROCEDURE: Select spaces using the Place Protests column of
the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) and place Available
Protests in those spaces.
If Raj is a player Faction, after placing all Protests check if there
are three or more Muslim League Activists in any space(s) selected for Civil Disobedience. If so, get one Activist from there
onto the Railway with the highest Econ value and no Activist
already (if more than one Civil Disobedience space qualifies,
select one at random).
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE NON-COOPERATION (3.3.4) PROCEDURE: Execute the Operation in every eligible Muslim
space.
8.6.6 NP Revolutionaries Operations. NP Revolutionaries
will execute an Operation as much as possible, given available
pieces and the state of the board. Follow all procedures for the
selected Operation (3.4).
NP REVOLUTIONARIES RALLY (3.4.1) PROCEDURE: First,
place Bases in all eligible spaces where Guerrillas exceed Unity
(8.4.1); use the Place Bases column of the Space Selection Priorities table if there are more eligible spaces than Available Bases.
Then, select spaces to place Guerrillas using the Place Guerrillas column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). After
placing pieces, move one Guerrilla from Out of Play to Available.

EXAMPLE of NP Raj Govern: Arjuna card BB instructs NP Raj to execute Govern first (if possible).
There are no Protest spaces without Activists, so
instruction is skipped. NP Raj will next attempt to
shift spaces towards Active Support using instruction
. First, it rolls a die to see the extent to which it can
perform Imperialism: the result is 2. Then, it uses
the Shift to Support column of the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces from among
those that are eligible for Imperialism: spaces with
cubes and no Active adversaries (4.2.2). Bihar is
selected as the first space (it is a “2-Pop space with
no Protest, with Unrest, and the most Opposition”).
First, NP Raj must remove the Unrest marker. Then, it
may shift Support in Bihar. Normally, it could shift up
to two levels towards Active Support, however, with

33

NP REVOLUTIONARIES MARCH (3.4.2) PROCEDURE:
Use the Move Priorities table (8.4.2). First, select an origin
space (instruction A): the space with the most Guerrillas not
already selected as a destination. Next, select a destination space
(instruction B), using the March column of the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1); spaces that have already been selected
as origin spaces may not be selected as destinations. Then,
keeping Guerrillas in origin spaces as directed by the Move
Priorities table (8.4.2), move one Guerrilla to the destination.
If no Guerrillas are eligible to move to a selected destination,
skip this destination space and select a new one.
After one Guerrilla has moved to the destination, check to see
if additional Guerrillas are eligible to move from the selected
origin (instruction C). If more Guerrillas may move, return to
instruction B to select a destination space (a destination may be
selected more than once). If no Guerrillas may move from the
selected origin, and if NP Revolutionaries may select another
origin space (8.6.1), return to instruction A to select another
origin (the space with the most Guerrillas that has not already
been selected as a destination). Continue selecting additional
origin spaces and destinations until NP Revolutionaries have
selected the maximum origin spaces for this Operation (8.6.1)
or no Guerillas remain eligible to move (8.4.2).
PLAY NOTE: Unlike other NP Factions, NP Revolutionaries
will only move one Guerrilla to a destination before returning
to the Space Selection Priorities table to select another destination, possibly even a space already selected as a destination.

a die roll result of 2 and one Unrest marker removed, NP Raj will only
shift Bihar one level towards Active Support, from Passive Opposition
to Neutral. NP Raj is finished with Imperialism. Since NP Raj has only
selected one space for Govern so far and has finished instruction , it
next executes instruction . NP Raj uses the Remove or Replace column
of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the last space for
Govern, and then uses the Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to select the
adversary piece to remove from that space.

Gandhi ~ Rules

NP REVOLUTIONARIES ATTACK (3.4.3) PROCEDURE:
Use the Attack or Go Underground column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces for Attack. Continue
to select spaces for Attack until NP Revolutionaries fail their Activation Number roll (8.6.2) or no eligible spaces remain (8.4.1).
NP REVOLUTIONARIES UNREST (3.4.4) PROCEDURE:
Use the Place Unrest column of the Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1) to select spaces for Unrest. Continue to select spaces
for Unrest until NP Revolutionaties fail their Activation Number
roll (8.6.2) or no eligible spaces remain (8.4.1).
PLAY NOTE: During a Crisis (6.8), remember that spaces
with both Congress and Muslim League Activists (with or
without an Underground Guerrilla) are eligible for Unrest
Operations (3.4.4).

8.7 NP Special Activities
PLAY NOTE: Section 8.7 details procedures for NP Special
Activities and can be referenced by the player as needed during play if the Player Aid and Arjuna are insufficiently clear.
When directed by Arjuna (8.3) to execute a Special Activity,
follow the directions in the Special Activity instructions box on
the selected Arjuna card. A NP Faction will implement the first
listed Special Activity that it can. If a specified Special Activity
cannot be carried out (because no spaces eligible for that Special
Activity, or a check condition is not met), skip it and continue to
the next. Once a Special Activity has been selected, execute all
instructions first, then instructions, and so forth. Implement
each instruction as much as possible. For Special Activities with
multiple options (i.e., Raj Govern, Congress Satyagraha, NV
Negotiate and Persuade), only implement actions as instructed
by Arjuna.
EXAMPLES of Skipping Special Activity Instructions: Arjuna
card H reads: “ Negotiate to Release Gandhi from Jail.” If
Gandhi is not in Jail, do not Negotiate to remove a Muslim State
instead. Rather, skip this instruction and execute the next one:
“ Satyagraha to Move Gandhi.”

8.7.1 NP Raj Special Activities.
NP RAJ TREATY (4.2.1) PROCEDURE: Remove or arrest
Active adversaries in each State with Sepoys.
NP RAJ GOVERN (4.2.2) PROCEDURE: Follow the sequence
of Govern actions on the Arjuna card. If no more spaces are
eligible for the first action (and NP Raj has not yet selected two
spaces), execute the second action, and so forth.
●	 Remove Protests: In each space with cubes, Protest, and no
Activists, remove the Protest marker. If there are more than
two such spaces, use the Remove or Replace column of the
Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces.
●	 Imperialism: Roll a die. NP Raj will attempt to remove
Unrest and Muslim State markers, and shift levels towards
Support, up to the roll result, in up to two spaces. Use the
Shift to Support column of the Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1) to select among spaces eligible for Imperialism
(4.2.2). If there are any Unrest markers in the selected space,
remove them first. Then, if present remove a Muslim State
marker. If no Muslim State marker present, instead shift the
space(s) up to two levels towards Active Support. Continue
to remove markers and shift Support until the limit set by
the die roll has been reached (as much as possible).
●	 Remove Adversaries: Use the Remove or Replace column
of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select
each space, and use the Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to
determine the piece removed from each selected space.
PLAY NOTE: If executing Imperialism, note that NP Raj sometimes may not use up its allotted shifts and number of markers
removed—the die roll simply sets an upper limit. Unused shifts
may not be retained for later turns.
NP RAJ MARTIAL LAW (4.2.3) PROCEDURE: From among
spaces that already have Unrest (exception: Lord Linlithgow,
see below), use the Remove or Replace column of the Spaces
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the space(s) for Martial
Law. If India is in Crisis (6.8), select two eligible spaces (8.4.1);
otherwise, select one eligible space.

Arjuna card N reads “
Crisis: Infiltrate to Place a Muslim
State.” If India is not in Crisis, the Muslim League may not use
Infiltrate to place a Muslim State, so skip this instruction.

VICEROY CAPABILITIES:
●	 If Lord Linlithgow is the current Viceroy, NP Raj may
select spaces without Unrest for Martial Law.

If executing a Limited Operation (2.3.5), ignore all Special
Activity instructions on the selected Arjuna card.

8.7.2 NP Congress Special Activities.
NP CONGRESS NEGOTIATE (4.3.1) PROCEDURE: Execute
the action specified by the Arjuna card (if possible; if not, skip
this instruction per 8.7). If attempting to release Gandhi, use the
Move or Release Gandhi column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select his destination space. If removing a
Muslim State, use the Remove or Replace column of the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the Muslim State space
among eligible spaces.

PROCEDURE: Use the active Faction’s Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the first space for the Special Activity.
Once a space is selected, execute the Special Activity in that
space. If the NP Faction may select additional spaces, return
to the Space Selection Priorities table to select another space.
Continue selecting spaces until the maximum number of spaces
have been selected, or no eligible spaces remain.
When a Special Activity results in removing adversary pieces,
consult the Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to determine the
piece(s) removed from the selected space.

NP CONGRESS SATYAGRAHA (4.3.2) PROCEDURE: If
Gandhi is in Jail, NP Congress always requests that Gandhi
be released (if the request is denied, NP Congress will select
a different Special Activity per the selected Arjuna card). NP
Congress will always use Satyagraha to move Gandhi. Use the

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules
Move or Release Gandhi column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the destination space. Then, execute
the action specified by the Arjuna card. When removing Unrest,
also remove any Protest marker in that space.
PLAY NOTE: At times, moving Gandhi out of a space may
yield Raj Control there.
NP CONGRESS PERSUADE (4.3.3) PROCEDURE: Follow
the sequence of Persuade actions on the Arjuna card. If no more
spaces are eligible for the first action (and NP Congress has not
yet acted in two spaces), execute the second action.
●	 Activate Guerrillas: Use the Remove or Replace column of
the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces
with Active Congress Activists.
●	 Remove 1 Adversary: Use the Remove or Replace column
of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces,
and use the Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to select the piece
to remove.
8.7.3 NP Muslim League Special Activities.
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE NEGOTIATE (4.4.1) PROCEDURE:
Execute the action specified by the Arjuna card (if possible; if
not, skip this instruction per 8.7). If removing Unrest, use the
Remove or Replace column of the Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1) to select the space. If placing a Muslim State, use
the Place Muslim State column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the eligible Province if there is more
than one.
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE INFILTRATE (4.4.2) PROCEDURE:
Use the Remove or Replace column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the space, and use the Adversary
Priorities table (8.5) to select the piece to replace.
NP MUSLIM LEAGUE PERSUADE (4.4.3) PROCEDURE:
Follow the sequence of Persuade actions on the Arjuna card. If
no more spaces are eligible for the first action (and NP Muslim
League has not yet acted in two spaces), execute the second
action.
●	 Activate Guerrillas: Use the Remove or Replace column of
the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces
with Active Muslim League Activists.
●	 Remove 1 Adversary: Use the Remove or Replace column
of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select spaces,
and use the Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to select the piece
to remove.
8.7.4 NP Revolutionaries Special Activities.
NP REVOLUTIONARIES AID (4.5.1) PROCEDURE: NP
Revolutionaries will only use Aid to flip Guerrillas Underground.
Use the Attack or Go Underground column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select up to two spaces with
Active Guerrillas and flip all Guerrillas in the selected spaces
underground.
NP REVOLUTIONARIES INFILTRATE (4.5.2) PROCEDURE: Use the Remove or Replace column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the space, and use the
Adversary Priorities table (8.5) to select the piece to replace.

35

NP REVOLUTIONARIES ASSASSINATE (4.5.3) PROCEDURE: From among spaces already selected for Unrest (3.4.4),
use the Remove or Replace column of the Space Selection
Priorities table (8.4.1) to select a space, and use the Adversary
Priorities table (8.5) to select the piece removed.

8.8 NP Events

NP Factions execute Events per the NP Eligibility Table (8.2.1).
PLAY NOTE: We did our best to write Events that could be
executed by NP Factions without additional instructions, but
this was a difficult part of the design. When in doubt, use your
best judgement to make the Event as effective as possible for
the NP Faction. If you ever get really stuck, make the best
move you can for that Faction.
8.8.1 NP Critical Events. If a Faction’s icon on the Event card
is underlined (with a rifle for NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries;
with an arrow for NP Congress and NP Muslim League), this
Event is a Critical Event for that NP Faction. Generally, NP
Factions will choose a Critical Event in lieu of an Operation
plus Special Activity, and will Pass in order to select a Critical
Event on the Upcoming card (8.2.1).
8.8.2 Shaded or Unshaded? NP Raj always selects the unshaded
Event text. Generally, NP Congress, NP Muslim League, and
NP Revolutionaries select the shaded Event text. However, if
the Faction icon on the Event card is highlighted by a square
halo, that NP Faction instead selects the unshaded Event text.
8.8.3 Effective Events. NP Factions will only choose to execute
an Event if that Event results in one or more effective actions
(but will always implement any required actions). Events that
do not result in any effective outcomes are not effective for that
NP Faction. See the Effective Events table on the Non-player
Aid for a list of the specific actions that are effective for each
NP Faction. Ignore all instructions to add or subtract Raj or
Revolutionaries Resources.
8.8.4 Implementing Event Text. As per 5.1.2, NP Factions will
execute as much of the Event as required by the text, selecting spaces where as much of the Event text can be carried out.
When given a choice, NP Factions only implement Event text
that would cause the Event to be effective for that NP Faction
(8.8.3). When the Event text instructions include “…up to…”,
implement the effect as much as possible and only if the action
is effective for the executing NP Faction.
Important: When given a choice, NP Factions only implement Event text actions that meet that NP Faction’s criteria
for an effective Event (8.8.3).
EXAMPLES of Effective Event Text: NP Raj executes Card #6:
Chauri Chaura Massacre. The unshaded text reads: “In 1
Protest space, remove all pieces belonging to 1 Faction: Gandhi
and Activists to Jail; cubes, Guerrillas, and Bases to Available.”
NP Raj would not choose to remove cubes, because only Events
that remove adversary pieces are effective for NP Raj. In this
case, NP Raj would use the Remove or Replace column of the
Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the target space

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

36

Gandhi ~ Rules

from among Protest spaces, then use the Adversary Priorities
table (8.5) to determine which adversary Faction to target in
that space.
NP Congress executes card #16: Pakistan Declaration Published in London. The unshaded text reads: “Add 1 Unrest
marker to up to 2 Muslim spaces, then remove 1 Base from among
the selected spaces.” Adding Unrest is not an effective Event for
NP Congress (8.8.3), but removing adversary pieces is, so NP
Congress will execute the Event. It uses the Remove or Replace
column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select
up to two spaces from among Muslim spaces with Bases. In each
such space, it will remove a Base. NP Congress will place Unrest
as the Event text is specific and does not allow the option not to
place Unrest. If there were no Bases to remove, this Event would
not be an effective Event for NP Congress.
8.8.5 Selecting Spaces for Events. NP Factions always use
their own Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the
space(s) where the Event will be executed. Use the column on
the Space Selection Priorities table that matches the Event action
that makes this Event effective for the active NP Faction. If a
NP Faction will execute multiple effective actions for an Event,
use the leftmost column on the Space Selection Priorities table
to select spaces for all Event actions.
EXAMPLE: The unshaded text for Card 44 reads: “Remove up
to 2 Guerrillas total from up to 2 spaces, then shift each of those
spaces 1 level towards Active Support.” This Event shift spaces
towards Active Support and removes adversary pieces, both of
which make this an effective Event for NP Raj. NP Raj would
use the Shift to Support column on the Space Selection Priorities
table because that column is further to the left than Remove or
Replace. Even though NP Raj used the Shift to Support column
to select spaces, it will still remove Guerrillas from those spaces
because this is an effective action for NP Raj.
Use the following guidelines to determine the appropriate column to use on the active NP Factin’s Space Selection Priorities
table (8.4.1):
NP RAJ. If the selected Event text reads...
●	 Add or place cubes: use the Place Cubes column.
●	 Activate, arrest, move to Out of Play, remove, or replace:
use the Remove or Replace column.
●	 Set or shift spaces: use the Shift to Support column.
NP CONGRESS. If the selected Event text reads…
●	 Activate Guerrillas, move cubes, remove, or replace: use
the Remove or Replace column.
●	 Add Activists, move Activists from Out of Play, place
Activists, or release Activists: use the Place Activists
column.
●	 Add Protest or Place Protest: use the Place Protests column.
●	 Move Gandhi or Release Gandhi: use the Move or Release
Gandhi column.
●	 Set or shift spaces: use the Shift to Opposition column.

NP MUSLIM LEAGUE. If the selected Event reads…
●	 Activate Guerrillas, move cubes, remove, or replace: use
the Remove or Replace column.
●	 Add Activists, move Activists from Out of Play, place
Activists, or release Activists: use the Place Activists
column.
●	 Add a Base or place a Base: use the Place Bases column.
●	 Add Protest or Place Protest: use the Place Protests column.
●	 Place a Muslim State: use the Place Muslim States column.
●	 Set or shift spaces: use the Shift to Opposition column.
NP REVOLUTIONARIES. If the selected Event text reads…
●	 Add Guerrillas: use the Place Guerrillas column.
●	 Add Unrest: use the Place Unrest column.
●	 Add a Base or place a Base: use the Place Bases column.
●	 Arrest, remove or replace: use the Remove or Replace
column.
●	 Attack: use the Attack or Go Underground column.
●	 Flip Underground: use the Attack or Go Underground
column.
8.8.6 Placing Pieces. When instructed by Event text to place
pieces on the map, select the destination space for each piece
individually. When given an option, NP Raj always places
Troops first, from either Available or Out of Play.

8.9 NP Campaign Rounds

During Campaign Rounds, NP Factions execute each step of
every Phase unless instructed not to. These instructions provide
details that specify how each NP Faction implements each Phase.
8.9.1 Resource Phase (6.2.1). NP Congress places Strike markers on each eligible Railway. If there are insufficient Strike
markers, select those with the highest Econ (1.3.6) first. Both
NP Raj and NP Revolutionaries skip this Phase.
8.9.2 Support Phase (6.3.1). For each NP Faction, execute the
Support Phase as follows:
●	 NP Raj uses the Shift to Support column of the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select up to four spaces.
Among all selected spaces, remove Unrest markers and shift
levels towards Active Support up to twice a die roll. In each
space selected, first remove any Unrest, then shift the space 2
levels towards Active Support. Continue selecting additional
spaces until the rolled total has been met, or four spaces have
been selected. Release two Activists from Jail for each space
selected. If possible, release one Congress and one Muslim
League Activist. Finally, if Gandhi is in Jail, release him to
a random space with no Raj Control.
●	 NP Congress then NP Muslim League select spaces for
Constructive Programme using the Shift to Opposition
column of their Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). Each
NP Faction selects as many eligible spaces as possible, up to
Unity.
●	 NP Muslim League places a Base using the Place Bases
column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). Select
from among non-Railway spaces with no Raj Control.

© 2019 GMT Games, LLC

Gandhi ~ Rules
●	 NP Revolutionaries place a Base using the Place Bases
column of the Space Selection Priorities table (8.4.1). Select
from among non-Railway spaces with no Raj Control.
8.9.3 Redeploy Phase (6.4). First, replace the current British
Viceroy with the Campaign card that triggered this Campaign
Round (6.4.1).
Then, Redeploy pieces for each NP Faction, following all Redeploy Phase restrictions (6.4) when moving pieces. If there are
not enough pieces to meet an instruction, move as many pieces
as possible and select destination spaces at random from among
specified spaces:
●	 NP Raj: Move cubes as outlined below and keep other cubes
in their current spaces. Move cubes from Provinces with no
Raj Control first, then from spaces with the most Sepoys
(choose randomly if more than one). Lose no Raj Control.
Move cubes only once during Redeploy:
1.	 For each Troop in a Province, move one Sepoy to the
Troop’s Province.
2.	 Get one Troop to each City, then remove Troops not
needed to retain Raj Control of Provinces and all but one
Troop in each City to Available.
3.	 Get 1 Sepoy to each City, then get Sepoys to add Raj
Control to all Cities with no Raj Control.
4.	 Get one Sepoy each to three States with no Support.
5.	 Distribute cubes remaining in Provinces with no Raj
Control evenly among spaces with Raj Control, 2-Pop
first.
●	 NP Congress: Move Activists from the spaces with the most
Congress Activists (choose randomly if more than one). Keep
Activists equal to Population in each space not at Active
Opposition. Move Activists only once during Redeploy:
1.	 Get Gandhi to the space with the most Support, 2-Pop
first.
2.	 Get two Activists to each 2-Pop space, non-Muslim first.
3.	 Get one Activist to each 1-Pop space, most Support first.
4.	 Distribute remaining Activists evenly among 2-Pop
spaces.
●	 NP Muslim League: Move Activists from the spaces with
the most Muslim League Activists (choose randomly if more
than one). Keep Activists equal to Population in each Muslim
space. Move Activists only once during Redeploy:
1.	 Get Muslim League Activists so that Muslim League
pieces (Activists plus Bases) exceed Congress pieces
(Activists plus Gandhi) in all 2-Pop Muslim spaces.
2.	 Get two Activists to each 2-Pop Muslim space, most
Support first.
3.	 Get one Activist to each 1-Pop Muslim space, most
Support first.
4.	 Distribute remaining Activists evenly among 2-Pop
Muslim spaces.

37

●	 NP Revolutionaries: Move Guerrillas as outlined below and
keep other Guerrillas in their current spaces. Move Guerrillas
from the spaces with the most Guerrillas (choose randomly if
more than one). Keep one Guerrilla in each space with Unrest
or a Revolutionaries Base. Move Guerrillas only once during
Redeploy:
1.	 Get one Guerrilla to each space with Unrest and no Raj
Control.
2.	 Get one Guerrilla to each space with a Revolutionaries
Base.
3.	 Get three Guerrillas to 2-Pop spaces without Unrest, most
Support first.
8.9.4 Reset Phase (6.5). Execute the Reset Phase per 6.5. In
addition:
●	 Shuffle the Arjuna deck.
●	 If Congress is a Non-player Faction, at the end of the Reset
Phase place a Protest marker in one space with Congress
Activists. Use the Place Protests column of the Space
Selection Priorities table (8.4.1) to select the space.

8.10 1-Player Victory

A lone player in a 1-player game never wins before the final
Campaign Round. To succeed, the player must both avoid any
Non-player exceeding its victory threshold during any Victory
Phase (which would end the game then, 7.1-7.3) and have the
highest victory margin upon the final Victory Phase. Break ties
per 7.1.
NON-PLAYER VICTORY: Unless the player wins, the Nonplayer Faction with the highest victory margin (ties per 7.1)
wins the contest:
●	 If Revolutionaries—Indian Civil War. As Britain
withdraws, India crumbles into communal violence as
Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs maneuver to defend their own
ethnic enclaves.
●	 If the Muslim League—Independent Pakistan. Britain
withdraws from India while negotiating the partition of the
subcontinent into separate Hindu and Muslim states. Many
are killed in the ensuing violence before an uneasy peace
settles along the new frontier between India and Pakistan.
This is the historical outcome.
●	 If Indian National Congress—United Free India. A
politically dominant Congress party negotiates the withdrawal
of British forces and establishes the largest democracy on the
planet. India remains staunchly non-aligned in the global
Cold War that follows.
●	 If British Raj—Commonwealth India. British control
of India remains firm, allowing Britain to negotiate Indian
independence on its own terms. An important and powerful
Commonwealth ally, India guards British and American
interests in Asia.

Gandhi ~ Rules

PLAYER VICTORY: If the player does survive to the final
Campaign Round and has the highest victory margin, subtract
the highest NP margin from the player’s to find the degree of
success:
●	 1 to 5 — Costly independence! As decolonization
movements sweep away old empires, Britain withdraws
from India, leaving behind a fragile coalition of Hindu and
Muslim factions. India has gained independence, but its future
is uncertain.
●	 6 or more, Player as Revolutionaries—Azad Hind! Britain
leaves India in disgrace as growing unrest across South Asia
and political pressure at home make continued occupation
impossible. The defeat inspires anti-colonial revolutionary
groups around the globe to take up arms against their
oppressors.
●	 6 or more, Player as Congress—Hind Swaraj! Gandhi’s
strategy of nonviolent resistance allows Britain to leave
India without enmity. As South Asia transitions to peaceful,
democratic rule the Indian independence movement becomes
a potent model of successful nonviolent resistance.

●	 6 or more, Player as the Muslim League—Pakistan
Zindabad! Muslim demands for an independent nation force
a departing Britain to partition South Asia. The new Pakistan
becomes a model for the modern Muslim state.
●	 6 or more, Player as the British Raj—God Save the King!
Britain retains control of India despite widespread resistance,
both nonviolent and violent. Eventually recognizing that the
imperial era is over, its withdrawal from India is controlled
and orderly. The British people are praised for their dignified
handling of decolonization.

SET UP (2.1)
General

Choose a scenario and Non-player (if fewer than four players,
1.5, 8.0, 8.9) options desired. Prepare the deck per the instructions below and per the scenario. Give each player a Faction
foldout, and assign players their Factions (1.5, or see 8.0 Nonplayer option):
2-player: Raj and Revolutionaries versus Congress and Muslim
League
3-player: Raj verses Revolutionaries versus Congress and
Muslim League
4-player: A Faction each player, Raj, Revolutionaries, Congress,
and Muslim League.

Deck Preparation

Separate out the 7 Campaign cards and shuffle them together.
Shuffle the Event cards and randomly deal them into a number
of facedown piles of 6 cards each as specified in the scenario.
Shuffle one Campaign card into certain 6-card piles, as the
scenario specifies. Stack the first pile onto the second onto the
third, and so on, to form a single facedown draw deck and place
it on the Draw Deck space on the board. Randomly select one of
the unused Campaign cards to be the starting Viceroy of India
and place it in the British Viceroy of India box. Set aside any
remaining Event and Campaign cards - they will not be used
and may not be inspected.

If playing more than one Faction, your final victory margin (7.3)
is equal to the lesser victory margin of your two Factions.
Put the wooden Forces pieces in their Available Forces boxes
and all markers in a pile or receptacle within easy reach. Keep
remaining aid sheets at hand. Set up the game board per the
scenario, placing Forces and markers onto the board as listed.	

SCENARIOS
Short: 1930 – 1947

March, 1930: Britain’s restrictive salt law becomes the focus of
Gandhi’s most famous act of civil disobedience. He begins the

coast three weeks later with 50,000. The Salt March inspires
nonviolent resistance across India by “shaking the foundations
of the British Empire.”

Gandhi ~ Rules

QUICK START GUIDE ~ Multiplayer Game
If you have experience with the COIN system and can’t wait
to jump into the game, follow these quick start rules to start
playing right away.

Important Rules:

Setup:

T	 Raj Control is determined solely by Active pieces: cubes,
Bases, Gandhi, Active Activists, and Active Guerrillas. Only
Raj may Control a space (1.7).
T	NV Activists are always Active in Protest spaces and on
Railways, and always Inactive everywhere else (1.4.3).
T	Raj Troops (red cubes) Operate for free. Pay Resources
equal to Restraint for each space where Sepoys (white cubes)
Operate (3.1).
T	 Raj cubes may not exit Protest spaces during Garrison (3.2.2),
Sweep (3.2.3), and Treaty (4.2.1).
T	 Gandhi and Activists removed by Assault (3.2.4), Treaty
(4.2.1), and Govern (4.2.2) are sent to the Jail box (1.3.9).
Some Events (5.0) also specify that NV pieces are sent to
Jail. Pieces in Jail are not Available to be placed on the map
until released (3.3.1, 4.3.2).
T	 Congress and the Muslim League do not use Resources.
Instead, they may select a limited total number of spaces for
Operations (3.3).
T	 Green tinged-spaces are Muslim spaces (1.3.4).
T	 Yellow-tinged spaces are Princely States (1.3.5). Raj never
Controls a State and Raj Troops (red cubes) may never enter
or be placed in States.
T	 A Province becomes a Muslim State when a Muslim State
marker has been placed in its Control box during the game
(4.4.1, 4.4.2). Muslim States follow all rules for Princely
States.
T	 When a Campaign card is revealed, immediately perform a
Campaign Round (6.0).
T	 A Crisis (6.8) occurs every time that both Restraint (6.6) and
Unity (6.7) are 1. Each Faction has special capabilities that
apply only during Crisis.

1.	 Follow the instructions in the back of the rule book to set up
the Main Scenario.
2.	 Prepare the Event deck by shuffling together all 72 Event
cards, then deal eight piles of six cards each. Shuffle together
all seven Campaign cards and, without revealing any, shuffle
one Campaign card into the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth
piles. Stack the piles together (first on top, eighth on the
bottom) and put the Event deck in the Draw Deck box. Reveal
the top card in the Event deck and place it in the Current
card box. Reveal the next card in the Event deck. Set aside
all leftover Event cards, unseen.
3.	 From the remaining Campaign cards, draw one at random
and place it face-up in the British Viceroy of India box. Set
aside any leftover Campaign cards, unseen.
4.	 The Congress player places Gandhi, one Congress Activist,
and one Protest marker in any one space on the map. Flip any
Activists in that space so their icon is face-up and adjust the
Raj Control marker in that space, if cubes no longer exceed
Active pieces there.
5.	 The Faction whose icon is leftmost on the Current card is
1st Eligible. Gandhi follows the standard 4-player COIN
sequence of play (2.0).

Gandhi shares many of the features of previously published
COIN games, but has a number of important differences:

						               													<description>Gandhi: The Decolonization of British India, 1917&amp;ndash;1947 is Volume IX in GMT&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed COIN Series. Exploring one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prominent experiments with nonviolent resistance, Gandhi takes us to the subcontinent of India, the jewel in the crown of the British Empire, for a detailed look at the final decades of the British Raj. 1 to 4 players compete to determine the future of India; will the transition to home rule be a peaceful one, will India be split apart by partition or civil war, or will it remain firmly in the grip of empire?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gandhi offers a fresh perspective on the history of insurgency with the addition of a new type of faction to the COIN Series, the Nonviolent (NV) faction, while retaining the multi-faction, asymmetrical, card-assisted system of earlier titles in the COIN Series. COIN veterans will be able to jump right in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other features include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Gandhi as the game&amp;rsquo;s sole leader piece.&amp;#10;     Nonviolent operations and special activities.&amp;#10;     Nonviolent activists that are always active, but generally immune from Raj actions until engaged in protests (or caught up in post-terror reprisals).&amp;#10;     Protests that erode support but leave activists vulnerable to arrest by Raj forces.&amp;#10;     A Hindu-Muslim Unity track that measures tensions between these two communities, affecting resources, operations, and victory.&amp;#10;     A British Rule track that reflects shifts in colonial policy in response to events on the map, from resolve to restraint, affecting the cost of several actions.&amp;#10;     British Viceroys who come and go with each passing campaign and have their own unique effects on each faction.&amp;#10;     An out-of-play jail space that holds nonviolent forces arrested during martial law. Pieces can be kept in jail over several campaigns, but at a cost to the Raj.&amp;#10;     Independent Princely States that are never controlled by any faction, yet offer a haven for violent and nonviolent insurgents alike.&amp;#10;     Short and medium-length scenarios that allow for the study of different periods of the struggle against British rule in India.&amp;#10;     Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, and 4-player games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Gandhi, players will face a range of difficult and interesting strategic choices. Following in the innovative footsteps of previous COIN titles, Gandhi weaves together historical, political, and cultural threads and offers an opportunity to study nonviolent and violent resistance in one of the most significant colonial possessions from the age of European imperialism. Civil disobedience and non-cooperation, protests and terror, imperialism and constructive programme, growing unrest, negotiation, agitation, assassination, persuasion, boycotts, martial law, and many other options await.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Gandhi made it impossible for us to go on ruling India, but at the same time he made it possible for us to abdicate without rancor and without dishonour.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash; British Historian Arnold Toynbee&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
