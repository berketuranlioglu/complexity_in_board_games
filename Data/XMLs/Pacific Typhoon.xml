DEDICATION

To the fans of Atlantic Storm: Hearing your laughter at the gaming table when
you win or lose a round is the best spoil we’ve earned. Thank you for your goodnatured patience in waiting for this sequel game to Storm.
Special thanks to Don Greenwood and the ‘97 AH crew for helping to bring Atlantic Storm into existence.

INTRODUCTION

Pacific Typhoon is a strategy card game for 3–7 players, ages 10 to adult. It has
many similarities to the card game Atlantic Storm.
►If you already know how to play Atlantic Storm, just read the sections marked
with a ►symbol to start playing Pacific Typhoon.
Pacific Typhoon covers the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World
War II, from the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 Dec 1941, to the
formal surrender of Japan, 2 Sep 1945. Japan was already an Axis power and
had previously occupied parts of China and the Far East when she declared war
against the United States and several nations of the British Commonwealth. Being
an island nation, Japan had limited national resources, and she relied on imports
and open sea lanes to develop and prosper as a world power. Her military ambitions in the Pacific thus depended heavily upon the success of her navy’s officers,
ships and aircraft.
The war in the Pacific was a struggle for control of islands, but controlling an
island meant little if you did not control the seas that connected that island to the
rest of the world. The surest way to control the seas was to control the air space
over them. Ships could not long survive where the enemy had air superiority. Even
submarines, the naval weapon of stealth, had to fear enemy aircraft. However, air
power was least effective at night, so many vicious naval gun and torpedo battles
occurred during the hours of darkness in the confined waters around islands.
Japan won many victories early in the war, but Allied cryptanalysts deciphered
Japanese messages that permitted the U.S. to ambush and stop Japan’s militaristic
expansion in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway. It took another three years of
brutal fighting and two atom bombs before Japan would unconditionally surrender. The Japanese suffered severely during this period, but the Allied nations
(and especially those oppressed by Japanese occupation) also paid a heavy toll
in human lives lost.
Pacific Typhoon is primarily a game, but it is also a history lesson about the war
and the brave sailors and airmen who fought on both sides. The cards represent
many of the combatant vessels and aircraft types, as well as most of the famous
naval and air battles in which they fought.

Getting Started

Randomly determine dealer.
Dealer shuffles Force Deck and deals a hand of 6 cards to each player. The
rest go face down as the Draw Pile.
► Dealer shuffles Battle Deck and puts it face down. The Renewed Battle
card should be in the bottom half of this deck. See Rule 6.3.
Table talk is encouraged, but you may not show your cards to other players
except when playing or discarding.

Round of Play

Each Battle lasts one round of the table. Dealer leads 1st round, player on
his left leads 2nd round, etc.
Round leader flips over the top two Battle cards, selects one and discards
the other face up to Battle Discards.
► Round leader calls Time of battle (day or night) and Suit of battle (air,
surface, sub or combined). See Rule 7.4.
Each player in clockwise turn order, beginning with round leader, must do
one of the following (you may not pass):
○ Play at least one legal card, including
» No more than one Regular card
» Any number of Bonus (+ combat value) cards
» Any number of Event (no combat value) cards
○ OR discard one card instead of playing
○ OR discard entire hand instead of playing
Each player decides which side to fight on, but no player may play Allied
and Japanese cards together.
► The Typhoon, Fog, Gremlins and Day or Night event cards can be played
with either side. See Rule 13.
All plays must match Year of battle.
► All plays must fit Time of battle. Day cards may not be played at night,
and vice versa. Cards with an “Either” background may be played day or
night.
If you play a Fate card after its Victim (victims are marked by a  symbol),
you immediately destroy the victim (keep it as your spoil) unless the victim
is a battle card (marked by a  symbol), in which case the fate card’s combat
values are doubled during the battle.
A bonus card must match the type of its Parent card (aircraft, ship or sub
card) or be playable alone.

If you play an Admiral event card, you may change the declared suit to
combined OR play a second regular card.
An illegal play may be taken back into your hand before the next player has
played or discarded; otherwise, the illegal play is discarded instead.

End of Round

For each player, determine the combat value of their play(s). Count only
the values in the declared suit.
► Roll one die for each “?” to determine the combat value of that card. A
?1 is a die roll plus 1, a ?2 is a die roll plus 2, etc.
► A sun symbol () counts as 1 extra combat point in day battles.
► A moon symbol () counts as 1 extra combat point in night battles.
Total the combat values in declared suit for Allies and for Japanese. The
side with the highest total wins.
The player who played the highest combat value on the winning side divides
the Spoils. If tied with another player on the same side, the one who played
his card(s) first divides the spoils.
If the total combat was tied Allied vs. Japanese, place the engaged cards
underneath the battle card, refill hands and fight another round for the same
battle, with next round leader calling suit, etc.
If there were no cards with combat values greater than 0 in the declared suit,
discard the battle card (no winner) and any force cards in play.
The battle winner takes the battle card and losing enemy cards and divides
these spoil cards with all players who played a combat value of 1 or more
on the winning side.
► The winning side’s cards and any cards marked  (Recycle) are placed
face up in the Discard Pile.
Place your spoils in front of you, with force-card spoils face down but battlecard spoils face up so other players can see their resource and VP values.
Players fill their hands to 6 cards. Increase your hand size by 1 card for
each full resource or two half-full resource battle cards you have won, but
never more than 9 cards.
If the Draw Pile is exhausted, shuffle the Discard Pile and use those cards
as the new Draw Pile.
The next player to lead starts a new round of play.

End of Game

Play through end of Battle Deck, then count up the Victory Points (VPs)
each player has won as spoils.
If two or more players are tied to win, the one who has the most battle
card VPs wins.
If there is still a tie, the one who has the battle card with the lowest card
number wins.

GETTING STARTED

Etiquette



Like most card games, Pacific Typhoon is played sitting around a table. It is best
suited for 4–6 players. You could play it with 3 or 7 players, but it is not as satisfying an experience.
Randomly determine the dealer and (if desired) the order of seating at the table.
You can do this by dice roll or by each player drawing a battle card and sitting in
relative order according to the card numbers drawn, from lowest number (dealer)
to highest. (Return the cards to the Battle Deck afterwards.)
The dealer shuffles the Force Deck and deals each player a hand of 6 cards. Place
the remaining force cards face down. This is the Draw Pile.
The dealer (or someone he appoints) removes the Renewed Battle card from the
Battle Deck and divides the Battle Deck into two halves, one with 20 cards and the
other with 19. Add the Renewed Battle card to the pile of 19 so you’re left with
two piles of 20 battle cards. Shuffle each pile separately and then put the stack that
does not include the Renewed Battle card on top of the stack that does. In this way
the Renewed Battle card will not appear until the second half of the game.
Never show your cards to other players except when playing or discarding them.
Conversation between players is permitted and encouraged but it must be open.
You may talk about your cards to other players as long as you do so openly to the
whole table (and don’t show them). Don’t leave the table to discuss the game in
private, and don’t annoy other players by whispering or keeping notes. Otherwise,
try to talk other players into working against the person with the highest score
(which is not always apparent in the middle of a game) or on supporting your own
effort. A player doesn’t have to keep a promise—when it’s his turn, he may play
what he pleases regardless of any assurances he gave you.

THE ROUND OF PLAY

7.1	

Round Leader

7.2	

Leader Selects Battle

The game is played in rounds (also called Battles). Each player gets to play once
per round in clockwise order, starting with the round leader. Players take turns
leading the rounds.
The dealer leads the 1st round. At the end of that round, the player on his left leads
the 2nd round. At the end of that round, the next player on the left leads the 3rd
round, and so forth clockwise around the table for the entire game.
The player who leads a round draws two cards from the Battle Deck and flips them
face up. He selects one for battle and discards the other one face up to the Battle
Discards. Skip this battle selection step if the battle is continuing from the previous
round (see Battle Outcome, Tied Battle). The round leader must announce the year
of the battle card after he selects it (the battle card’s year is printed on the card,
and it limits what force cards may be played).
► Renewed Battle: If the round leader selects Renewed Battle as the battle card,
he exchanges Renewed Battle for one battle card from another player’s spoils. He
may then announce the card’s year or choose a different year for that battle, except
the year he chooses may not precede the year printed on the card.

7.3	

► Leader Selects Time

7.4	

Leader Selects Suit

The round leader then chooses “Day” or “Night” and announces this to the other
players. The declared time limits what force cards can be played. Force cards
with a day background may only be played during a day battle; force cards with
a night background may only be played during a night battle. Force cards with a
twilight background may be played day or night. You may never declare “Either”
as the time of battle.
After choosing the time, the round leader chooses and announces the suit (operation type) of the battle. There are four choices:
•
•
•
•

Air
Surface
Sub
Combined

The suit determines what combat values apply to the battle’s outcome. Combat
values that don’t match the suit are treated as 0 during the battle. If the suit is
combined, all three combat values apply. The round leader always calls the suit
and time for the battle, even if he discards instead of plays.

7.5	



Must Play or Discard

After the year, time and suit are chosen, each player, starting with the round leader
and going in clockwise order around the table once, may do one of three things:
•

•
•

Play face up at least one legal card from his hand, including:
○ One Regular card (any card that is not a bonus or event card). You may
not play more than one regular card unless you use the Admiral event
ability to do so.
○ Any number of Bonus cards (a bonus card has + combat values) that are
playable. The bonus card(s) must attach to the regular card (its Parent)
or be playable without a parent card.
○ Any number of Event cards that are playable per their restrictions (an
event card has no combat values).
Or discard one card from his hand to the Discard Pile instead of playing.
Or discard his entire hand to the Discard Pile instead of playing.

7.6	

May Only Play One Side

7.7	

No Passing

7.8	

► Illegal Play

A player usually has a mix of Allied and Japanese Force cards in his hand. You
are free to choose which side you fight on during the battle, but you may never
play cards from both sides together. For example, if you play an Allied regular
card, you may not play a Japanese bonus or event card with it. In the case of Allied
cards, the exact nationality doesn’t matter. For example, you may attach a U.S.
bonus card to an Australian parent card.
You may not “pass” your turn. You don’t have to play a card during your turn,
even if you have a card that matches the battle’s year and the declared time. But
if you don’t play, you must choose one of the two discard options.
If you make an illegal play and it is noticed before the next player makes his play
or discards, then you must take the illegal play back into your hand and re-do your
turn. If the illegal play is not noticed until after the next player makes his play or
discards, then your illegal play is discarded and does not affect the battle. There
are several ways your play may be illegal, including:
•
•
•
•
•

You play an Allied card together with a Japanese card (in which case treat
both as illegal).
The force card’s earliest year is later than the battle card’s year.
The force card’s time is opposite to the declared time of battle.
A bonus card’s type doesn’t fit its parent’s type (in which case the bonus
card is illegal).
The card’s restriction (printed on the card) doesn’t allow it to be played.

You are allowed to play a card that has a combat value of 0 in the declared suit.

Victims of Fate

8.1	

Announcing Fate

A force card that lists another card’s name on it is a
Fate card. It is fated against that listed card (its victim).
This is based on historical occurrences. For example,
the Japanese I-26 submarine sank the USS Juneau in
real life, so in the game the I-26 card is fated to sink the
Juneau card. A fate card may itself be a victim to some
other fate card—the two things are not exclusive.
A fate card only affects its victim if you play the fate card after the victim in the
current round (not in a previous round). If you play a fate card and its victim is
played later in the round, the victim does not suffer its fate. You should announce
the victim when you reveal the fate card. If you fail to announce it before the battle
outcome is determined, the fate does not occur.
A fate card targets its victim even if the fate card has a 0 combat value in the
declared suit. For example, if the round leader called “Day Air” and played the
Juneau, a player after him could play the I-26 and immediately sink the Juneau
even though the I-26 has a combat value of 0 in an air battle.

8.2	

Kinds of Victims

A Victim may be one of three kinds: a force card worth 0–6 VPs, a force card that
is recyclable, or a battle card worth 0–8 VPs. How the fate card works against
each kind varies slightly:
•
•
•

8.3	

VP Force Card (): You immediately destroy the victim. Remove it from
the battle and place it face down in front of you as your spoil.
Recyclable Force Card (): These are marked with a in place of a VP
value. You immediately discard the victim. Remove it from the battle and
place it face up in the Discard Pile.
Battle Card (): You double the combat value of your fate card in this
battle (when doubling a “?”, double the die roll result rather than roll two
dice). Do not double the combat value of any bonus cards you attach to
your fate parent card, and do not double the combat value of a parent card
if an attached bonus card is a fate card.

Victim Parent Card

If the victim was a parent to a bonus card, discard the bonus card (don’t destroy it).
For example, the round leader plays Maya with the Long Lance and Ocean Patrol
bonus cards attached (Maya is the parent of the bonus cards). The 2nd player plays
Dace and calls “fate” against Maya. Maya becomes the 2nd player’s spoil, and
Long Lance and Ocean Patrol are discarded because they require a parent card.

Bonus and Event Cards

9.1	

► Bonus Cards

9.2	

Parent Types

11

Bonus cards have “+” combat values. Add their combat values to the combat values of the regular card you play. The Kamikaze bonus card has * combat values
instead of + values. Replace the regular card’s combat values with the kamikaze
combat values. Most bonus cards may only be played in conjunction with a regular
card. This regular card is called the bonus card’s parent, and the bonus card is
said to “attach to the parent” card. Shinyo Flotilla, Ha-10, Ohka and PT 109 may
be played without a parent, but if they are played in addition to a regular card,
they must match that regular card’s type. You may never attach a bonus card to a
regular card that someone else has played.
There are three types of parent cards based on the shape of its photograph
frame:
•
•
•

Aircraft (includes aircraft carriers): windscreen frame
Ship: wide rectangle frame
Submarine: circle frame

A bonus card must match its parent type. For example, Turkey Shoot must attach
to an Allied parent card of the aircraft type. Ocean Patrol and Coast Watchers may
attach to any of the three parent types—they are not restricted to one type only.
A bonus card may not be attached to another bonus card or to an event card, but
two or more bonus cards may be attached to the same parent.

9.3	

► Event Cards

Event Cards are recognizable by having no combat values (or negative combat
values in the case of Gremlins). You may play one or more event cards during
your turn either by themselves or in addition to your regular and/or bonus card
plays. The event card(s) must be of the same side as your other card plays, but the
Allied nationalities don’t have to match. Typhoon,
Day or Night, Fog and Gremlins are playable with
either side.
Each event card has an effect printed on it. The effect
supersedes the normal rules of play. See the Notes
on Cards section of the rules for details about each
event card.

9.4	

Recycle

Most bonus and event cards have a  symbol in place of a VP value. The  stands
for Recycle. Such a card is discarded at the end of the round it is played, no matter
what the battle outcome is.

10	

Battle Outcome

A battle ends after the last player in a round plays or discards. When the battle
ends, roll a die for each “?” in the declared suit; a ?1 is a die roll plus 1, a ?2 is a
die roll plus 2, etc. A sun symbol () in the declared suit counts as 1 extra combat
point in day battles (thus 0 equals 1 during day but 0 at night). A moon symbol
in the declared suit () counts as 1 extra combat point in night battles (thus 2
equals 3 at night but 2 during day).
Total the combat values of the played cards for each side (Allied vs. Japanese), but
count only the combat values in the declared suit. If the suit is combined, count all
of the combat values. There are three possible outcomes to a battle: No Combat,
Tied Combat, or One Side Wins.

10.1	

No Combat

If there are no force cards in play at the end of the round, or if the only force
cards in play have 0 combat values in the declared suit or no combat values (event
cards), then the battle outcome is “no combat.” Discard the battle card to the Battle
Discards pile, and discard any force cards in play (including engaged cards from
a previous round) to the Discard Pile.

Example of No Combat

It’s a Day Surface battle for Coral Sea in a 4-player game. The round leader
plays Repulse. The next player plays Betty and calls fate against Repulse, sinking
it immediately. The 3rd player in the round discards instead of plays. The last
player plays Wildcat and calls fate against Betty, destroying it. Although there
has been fighting in the form of fate cards and their victims, the only remaining
card in play (Wildcat) has a 0 combat value in Surface, which was the declared
suit. So the battle outcome is treated as no combat, and Coral Sea and Wildcat
are both discarded.

10.2	

Tied Combat

If the total Allied combat value equals the total Japanese combat value, it is a “tied
combat.” The force cards are Engaged and that battle continues as follows:
Place the engaged force cards (including Recyclable ones) underneath the battle
card and fight a new round for that same battle card. Players fill their hands, and
the next player whose turn it is to lead a round declares the time and suit for the
new round. He may call the same time and suit or different ones. Players may
change sides—they are not committed to playing on the same side as they did
in the previous round. The engaged force cards underneath the battle card do
not affect the outcome of the new round, and they cannot be victimized by fate
cards played in the new round. Likewise, the effects of Typhoon, Day or Night
or Tokyo Rose do not carry over into the new round. A battle can be extended for
more than one round in this manner as long as each round ends in a tied combat
between Allies and Japanese.
If the round ends in a tie, but Little Boy has taken the battle card, then the engaged
force cards are discarded as if the outcome was no combat.

10.3

One Side Wins

The side with the highest total combat value wins the battle. The losing side’s
cards are destroyed (except for those that Recycle), and the winning side’s cards
are discarded. The player on the winning side who contributed the highest combat
value for that side is the battle winner. He gets to divide the spoils of the battle.
If two or more players on the winning side contributed the same highest combat
value, then the one who played his card(s) before the other highest contributor gets
to divide the spoils. (This is known as “Getting there firstest with the mostest.”)

Example of Winning Combat

It’s a Night Surface battle for Kolombangara in a 4-player game. The round
leader plays Cryptanalysts, which allows him to play last as Allied. The next
player plays Henley (1 combat value), and the 3rd player discards his hand. The
4th player plays ABDA Strike Force (? combat value). The round leader (who
delayed his play with Cryptanalysts) then plays Santa Fe and Coast Watchers
for a total of 3 combat value (2+1). The 4th player now rolls a die to determine
the combat value of ABDA Strike Force and he gets a 3 result. The Allied side
wins the battle 7 to 0 even though there has been no apparent fight (since no one
played a Japanese card). The 4th player divides the spoils, because he committed
ABDA Strike Force to the battle before the round leader committed Santa Fe and
Coast Watchers (which came as the last play). Both of those players contributed
3 combat value, which was the highest on the winning side. So the player who
committed his 3 first is the winner and gets to divide the spoils, which in this case
is just the Kolombangara card.

11	

Spoils

11.1	

What Constitutes Spoils

A player earns victory points (VPs) by collecting spoils in battle. Collecting the
most spoils is the only way to win the game.
Spoils include the battle card itself and all force cards of the losing side except any
Recyclable ones. All engaged cards belonging to the losing side are also treated
as spoils (except any Recyclable ones). Each spoil card is worth a number of VPs
as indicated on the card. A battle card may be worth 0–8 VPs, and a force card
may be worth 0–6 VPs.
All force cards from the winning side and all Recyclable force cards from the
losing side are put into the Discard Pile. They are not spoils.

11.2	

Dividing the Spoils

The winner of the battle must divide the spoil cards among himself and every
player who has in play a combat value of 1 or higher on the winning side at the
end of the round. If you played on the winning side but your combat value was 0,
or your play was removed because it was victimized or discarded by Typhoon or
some other reason by the end of the round, then you are not eligible for spoils.

Each player on the winning side must receive a spoil card before any one of them
may receive a second spoil card (and each of them must receive a second spoil
card before any one of them may receive a third spoil card, etc.). The winner who
divides the spoils doesn’t have to distribute the VPs evenly; he just has to distribute
the spoil cards evenly. So he will generally keep the highest-value VP spoil card(s)
for himself and distribute the lower-valued ones to the other winning players.
You do not have to keep any promises you make to other players regarding the
division of the spoils. Just because you promised a juicy spoil to someone for
supporting your side in the battle doesn’t mean you have to honor that promise
when you divide the spoils after winning.
If Catalina or Amagiri is used to rescue a spoil card, this occurs before the spoils
are divided (see rule 13.10).

End of Game

As you win spoil cards, place them on the table in front of you. Your resource
spoils (battle cards and Rosie the Riveter) must stay face up so players may see
their resource and VP values. Your other spoil cards should stay face down. In
this way, you can hide their VP value from other players. Players may not record
or inspect the VP value of hidden spoils belonging to other players until the end
of the game.
If you played a fate card to destroy a victim, the victim goes into your spoil pile,
but it doesn’t count against any spoils that may be due you at the end of the battle.
If you played Rosie the Riveter and the Allies win, that card doesn’t count against
your share of the spoils. Likewise, if you played Little Boy and are successful in
getting the battle card, it doesn’t count against your share of the spoils.
The game ends after 20 battles (when there are no more battle cards to select). At
that time, count up the spoil VPs each player earned. The player with the highest
total wins. If two or more players are tied to win, the one who has the most battle
card VPs wins. If they are still tied to win, the one who has the lowest battle card
number wins.

Example of Spoils

It’s a Day Air battle for Midway in a 4-player game. The round leader () plays
Enterprise. The 2nd player () plays Hiryu. The 3rd player () plays Akagi. Although Akagi is the victim of Enterprise, she avoids the fate by being played after
Enterprise. The 4th player () plays Dauntless, which is fated against Hiryu and
immediately destroys her. It’s the end of the round, so the 1st and 3rd players each
roll one die to determine their combat values. The 1st player rolls a 3. Because the
Enterprise has an air combat value of ?1, he has contributed 4 to the battle (3+1).
The 3rd player rolls a 2 for the ? air combat value of Akagi. The 4th player has an
air combat value of 1 for the Allies. So the Allies win 5 to 2, and the 1st player is
the battle winner because he contributed the highest Allied combat value. There
are two spoil cards, which he must divide between himself and the 4th player. He
gives Akagi to the 4th player and keeps Midway.

New Draw Pile

At the end of each round, after the battle outcome has been determined and before
the start of the new round, each player draws enough cards from the Draw Pile to
fill his hand to his hand size.
Your base hand size is 6 cards, but your spoil resources may increase this up to a
maximum of 9 cards. For every full-resource spoil card you have, increase your
hand size by 1 card. For every half-resource spoil you have, increase your hand
size by 1/2 card (so you must have two half-resource spoils before you can draw
an extra card). Empty-resource spoils do not increase your hand size.
If the number of cards in your hand equals or exceeds your hand size, you won’t
draw any new cards at the end of the round, but you don’t have to discard down
either. For instance, if you lose a resource because another player used Renewed
Battle to steal a battle card from your spoils, the number of cards in your hand may
exceed your hand size. This is okay—just keep playing. At some point, the number
of cards in your hand will drop below your hand size, and you may draw again.
When the Draw Pile is exhausted, shuffle the Discard Pile and place it face down
as the new Draw Pile.

► Notes on Cards

13.1	

Yamamoto and Halsey

These are admiral event cards. You may play an admiral card alone
or in addition to your other plays. When you play an admiral, you
do one of two things:
•

Change the declared suit to combined. This affects all players
in the round. You may not change suit from (for example) air
to sub; you may only change it to combined. If the admiral
card is discarded before the end of the battle due to Typhoon,
the suit remains combined—it doesn’t revert (this represents
a change from the rule in Atlantic Storm).

•

OR you may play 2 regular cards instead of 1. You may attach bonus cards to either or both of those regular cards as
permitted.

13.2	

Tora, Tora, Tora! and Cryptanalysts

Surprise was a major factor in the Japanese success at Pearl Harbor.
U.S. code-breakers contributed to the Allied victory at Midway, the
ambush of Yamamoto, and other victories during the war.

Playing one of these event cards during your normal turn allows you
to play last in the round, but you may only play that side or discard.
As usual, playing last allows you to see what everyone else has played
(except any cards hiding beneath Fog), perhaps to fate them or to play a victim
card safely, but you won’t win any ties since you’re playing after everyone else.
If you play Cryptanalysts and someone plays Tokyo Rose against
you before your final play, you won’t be able to play Allied because
of Tokyo Rose, and you won’t be able to play Japanese because of
Cryptanalysts, so you can only discard Cryptanalysts. Tora, Tora,
Tora! and Cryptanalysts are fated against each other, so if one appears
after the other in the round, the first one is discarded and that player
loses his turn—he may not play any more this round.

13.3	

Shangri-La and Decisive Battle

When reporters asked President Roosevelt where Doolittle’s bombers had come from, he replied, “Shangri-La,” referring to the hidden
retreat in the recently popular novel and film The Lost Horizon.
Japan’s Naval General Staff often developed plans to defeat the
larger U.S. fleet by concentrating their forces for a
decisive showdown.
If you play either of these event cards, it must be the first card you
play. They allow you to discard any number of cards from your
hand and refill it before finishing your play, but you may only play
that side. If you can’t or don’t want to play that side, then you must
© 2008 GMT Games, LLC

Pacific Typhoon

17

discard the Shangri-La or Decisive Battle to end your turn. When refilling your
hand after playing Shangri-La or Decisive Battle, don’t count that card play against
your hand size. For example, if you played Shangri-La and made no other discards,
you could still draw a replacement for Shangri-La before continuing your turn.
The round leader must pick a battle and declare the suit and time of battle before
he plays either of these cards.

13.4	

Rosie the Riveter

13.5	

Little Boy

You may play this event alone or in addition to an Allied play. It
represents the industrial might of America (U.S. shipbuilding and
aircraft production far outstripped Japan’s). If the Allies win this
battle (whether it occurs this round or in a subsequent round if this
round is tied), keep Rosie as a face-up resource spoil for yourself.
Discard Rosie if the Allies lose the battle or if it ends with a nocombat outcome. Rosie doesn’t count against any share of spoils
that may be due you after the battle.
The first atomic bomb, “Little Boy,” was dropped on Hiroshima on
6 Aug 1945; the second bomb, “Fat Man,” was dropped 3 days later
on Nagasaki. The U.S. used the bombs to hasten the end of the war
and to avoid having to invade Japan.

You must keep Little Boy as a spoil regardless of the battle outcome
(thus you lose 3 VPs for unleashing atomic weapons upon the world).
The battle outcome is determined normally, but if you roll 1–5 at the end of the
round, you get the battle card as a free spoil, even if the Japanese win the battle.
It doesn’t count against any share of the spoils that may be due you if the Allies
win. If you get the battle card and the battle outcome is a tie between the two
sides, then the battle does not continue into a new round and the other cards are
discarded instead of being engaged.

13.6	

Tokyo Rose

None of the English-speaking announcers on Radio Tokyo actually
used the name “Tokyo Rose,” but it was popularized by the Allied
press. Iva Toguri was convicted after the war for her broadcasts but
later pardoned.
This event card may be played alone or in addition to a Japanese play.
Select 2 players who will be playing after you in this round, and they
may not play Allied. If Tokyo Rose is discarded by Typhoon before one (or both)
of those selected players takes his turn, the restriction on them still applies.

13.7	

Typhoon

Typhoon is not playable before 1944 because most of the battles before then occurred in regions less affected by such severe weather.

© 2008 GMT Games, LLC

Pacific Typhoon

18

This event card may be played alone or with either side. It stops as soon as it is
effective, or at the end of the current round, whichever occurs first. If it fails and is
passed to a player who plays Cryptanalysts or Tora, Tora, Tora!, he
must roll for it, and if it continues to fail and is passed to him again at
the end of the round, he must roll for it again. It never continues into
the next round, even if the battle outcome is tied. A player who loses
his turn because of Typhoon does not get to roll for Day or Night if
it is passed to him—he must pass it to the next player.

13.8	

Day or Night

13.9	

Fog

This event card may be played alone or with either side. It stops as soon as it is
effective, or at the end of the current round, whichever occurs first. If it is passed
to a player and his roll fails, but he plays Cryptanalysts or Tora, Tora, Tora!, and it
continues to fail and is passed to him again at the end of the round, he must roll for
it again. If the battle time switches, there may be some cards played
previously in this round that are now illegal plays, so they should
be discarded. Never discard the battle card, even if the changed time
does not match the time printed on the battle. The time switch stays
in effect even if Typhoon is used later in the round to discard the Day
or Night card from play. If a player loses his turn for any reason, he
does not roll for Day or Night but passes it to the next player.
This event card may be played with either side. Only one regular
card and/or any permissible bonus cards may be played beneath Fog.
You may play additional valid cards in your same turn, but they are
never hidden by Fog. For instance, you could play Akagi face-down
beneath Fog and also play the Yamamoto event and Val face-up.
Cards hidden by Fog are revealed after all other players have played,
so you can hide what side you played on until the end of the round. Revealing
your play last is not the same as playing after everyone else plays. Your turn order
in the round is still the same as if you didn’t play beneath Fog. In this way, you
benefit when tying with another player on the same side if you play before him,
even though you don’t reveal your play until the end of the round. For the same
reason, Fog doesn’t allow you to escape fate:
•

If you play a victim card beneath Fog, and its fate card is played after your
play, and that fate card is still in play when you reveal your victim, then
your victim card must suffer its fate.

•

However, if the fate card is played after your victim play, but that fate card
is itself victimized or discarded for some reason before you reveal your
victim at the end of the round, then your victim is saved from its fate.

•

If you play a fate card beneath Fog, and its victim was played before your
play, then you don’t fate the victim until you reveal your fate card at the

© 2008 GMT Games, LLC

Pacific Typhoon

19

end of the round. So if that victim is discarded first for any reason, you’ve
missed your opportunity to fate it.
•

If the victim of your fate card is played after your play, then it is safe from
your fate card because you played before it.

13.10	 Catalina and Amagiri

PBY Catalina flying boats rescued countless aviators from the sea,
allowing them to return to battle again. The Amagiri towed disabled
warships to port on two occasions during the Solomons Campaign,
saving them from loss.
Unlike event cards, you may use either of these two cards for its
combat values or for its ability, but you may not use the ability if
the card is already deployed in the battle for its combat value. The card must be
in your hand when you use its ability. You then discard it and also discard the
“rescued” card, thus denying that spoil to someone and saving it from destruction.
The rescue should occur when the victim has been announced (in the
case of fate), or before spoils are divided (in the case of battle losses).
If there is more than one spoil card matching the criteria in the battle,
the player using the Catalina or Amagiri gets to choose the one that
is rescued. You may use these cards for their abilities even if you
play (or already played) on the other side during the battle.

13.11	 Gremlins

Gremlins were mythical creatures that Allied airmen blamed for
mechanical failures during the war. They were popularized in a
children’s book by Roald Dahl published in 1943, and in some
Warner Bros. cartoons released that same year.
This event card may be played alone or with either side. Play it against
another player, whether he has already played this round or not, and
regardless of the side he plays on. It reduces the combat value of his play, but
never below 0 in any of the three suits. For example, in a Combined battle where
someone targeted with Gremlins played a cruiser with values of 1 air, 2 surface
and 0 sub (3 total), the cruiser would be reduced to 0 air, 1 surface and 0 sub (for
1 total). The –1 to its sub value would have no effect.

13.12	 Allied Codenames for Aircraft

Allied and Japanese aircraft are identified by their Allied codenames instead of their
official designations (for example, Hellcat instead of F6F). The Allies used male
names for Japanese fighters and recon seaplanes, and female names for Japanese
bombers and other recon aircraft. The codename for the Zero-Sen (Type 00 navy
fighter) was Zeke, but most Allied servicemen called it simply Zero.

► Chronological Version

Some players prefer fighting the battles in chronological order. This requires
more card sorting and shuffling than in the standard version of the game. Use the
standard rules with the following changes:
•

Remove Rennell Island, Ormoc Bay and Renewed Battle from the Battle
Deck so you only have 37 battle cards.

•

Arrange the Battle Deck in reverse order of sequence, with Pearl Harbor
on top and Home Islands on the bottom.

•

Sort the Force Deck into five stacks based on year.

•

Shuffle the 1941 force cards and deal a hand of 3 cards to each player. The
rest of the 1941 force cards go face down as the Draw Pile.

•

The round leader flips over the top two battle cards, picks one to fight and
discards the other as in the standard version.

•

When the first battle card of the next year is flipped over, do as follows:
○ Shuffle that year’s force cards into the current Draw Pile.
○ Increase the hand size of each player by 1 card, except in 1945.

•

The base hand size depends on the current year:
Year

Hand Size

1941

3 cards plus 1 per resource spoil

1942

4 cards plus 1 per resource spoil, not to exceed 7 cards

1943

5 cards plus 1 per resource spoil, not to exceed 8 cards

1944 & 1945

6 cards plus 1 per resource spoil, not to exceed 9 cards

•

Never shuffle the Discard Pile into the Draw Pile until the Draw Pile is
empty.

•

The last battle of the war is always Home Islands.

15	

► Short Versions

To play a short standard version, make these two changes to finish the game after
13 battles:
•

Remove the Renewed Battle card from the Battle Deck so you only have
39 battle cards.

•

The round leader always flips over the top three battle cards (instead of the
top two), picks one and discards the other two.

To play a short chronological version, make these changes to finish the game
after 13 battles:

•

Instead of removing Rennell Island, Ormoc Bay and Renewed Battle from
the Battle Deck, remove Wake Island, Cape Esperance and Renewed Battle
so you only have 37 battle cards.

•

Follow the other rules of the chronological version except the round leader
flips over the top three battle cards, picks one and discards the other two.

16	

► Team Version

I would be remiss to Mark McLaughlin if I didn’t include a team version of the
game. He and a few others have told me how much their groups enjoy playing
Atlantic Storm with an even number of players (4 or 6) split between the two sides.
Use the standard rules with these changes:
•

Divide the players into equal teams. They should sit at the table in alternating positions so each player has an enemy player on both sides of him
in round order.

•

Remove Fog, Day or Night, Gremlins and Typhoon from the Battle
Deck.

•

Sort the remaining force cards into two draw piles—one consisting of
Allied cards for the Allied team and one consisting of Japanese cards for
the Japanese team.

•

The team with the most VPs at the end wins.

You can also play a Team Chronological Version or a Team Short Version by
combining the team rules with either of those rule sections.

Designer’s Notes

The idea for a Pacific version of Atlantic Storm occurred quickly enough. Some
of the playtesters of Storm expressed their desire for a sequel set in the Pacific
even before the original game came out in 1998. Mark McLaughlin was the first
to approach me with a Pacific prototype he designed based on the Storm system.
John Coussis was the next to talk to me about it (see his Developer’s Notes below),
and later Stephane Laulhere and Steve Cuyler came forward with their prototypes
of the same.
When you begin to think about the idea, you realize there are several alternate paths
to take. You can do a Silent Service version that emphasizes the U.S. submarine
war against Japan in the way Storm emphasizes the U-Boat war. You can do a
naval battles version that emphasizes famous battles such as Midway and Leyte
Gulf. Or you can do an island-hopping version that emphasizes ground forces as
much as ships and planes.
The latter approach appealed to me most, and we tested such a version even as
recently as 2003. The suits were air, land and sea, and at first I included every front
in the Pacific, so the battles ranged from Pearl Harbor to Imphal, and from the
Coral Sea to Manchuria. Some battles excluded ships, and some battles excluded

22

Pacific Typhoon

ground forces, but most battles revolved around islands and fit perfectly into an
air-land-sea system. Furthermore, the round leader declared if it was a day battle or
night battle. The force cards comprised a sampling of everything from Essex-class
carriers to Merrill’s Marauders, and from Japanese paratroopers to the Yamato.
The Pacific War is so full of great stories, and I wanted to present a wide selection.
But the game was too ambitious, so I trimmed and trimmed, then trimmed some
more. We enjoyed the game, but it lacked the finely-balanced interaction of suits
that Storm has. Finally, I set it aside and created a naval battles version that was
closer to the original game. It worked great, and John and I carefully developed
that into what you have now.
If you’ve never played Atlantic Storm or Pacific Typhoon, you might be confused
at first by the unusual structure of the game play: In the standard version, players
are not assigned to sides and battles do not occur in tidy, chronological order.
There are two simple reasons for this.
First, we want to recreate the uncertainty and chaos of war—you should be looking over your shoulder (figuratively) the whole time. Where is the enemy, and
what is he capable of? Will reinforcements arrive for your forces in time? Who
will receive the credit for victory or the blame for defeat? What battle might occur
next, and should you be saving your strength for it? This uncertainty makes card
management and decision-making more important. Fear and hesitation creep into
your mind when the next battle might be better to fight for than the current battle,
and you don’t know how much to trust the guy playing after you.
Second, we want table talk in the game. The best way to increase table talk is to
have negotiation. If all of the players are potential enemies and potential allies,
there is good reason to discuss the situation with those who are playing after you.
Point fingers and declare that someone else is winning. Appeal for help with the
offer of giving assistance in a future battle. Hide your greed behind a façade of
friendly support. Experienced players keep a running commentary during a battle,
declaring each side’s combat strength, and noting who stands to win. For example,
“It’s currently 7 Allied Air to 4 Japanese. Can you play at least 3 Japanese Air to tie
the battle? Otherwise, Roy is going to win the battle, and we don’t want that!”
Those are our reasons for the standard version. But we understand some players
still want to play in teams or to fight the battles in historical order. For them we
provide the Team and Chronological Versions. Playing the game in chronological order may also help you memorize the decks better, which is an important
advantage in competitive, tournament-level play.
Historical purists may point out that certain ships were available before the year
given on their cards. For example, Yamashiro is treated as a ‘44+ card when it
was available at the start of the war. This was a design choice to distribute the
cards across the years in a balanced way so neither side was too lopsided. In doing
so, I didn’t ignore history. Case in point: Yamashiro’s wartime participation was
negligible before 1944.
Historical purists might also raise an eyebrow because the game allows a ship
to fight in a late-war battle when historically it was sunk before that time, or to
© 2008 GMT Games, LLC

Pacific Typhoon

23

fight in a late-war battle and then to be destroyed in an early-war battle later in
the game. This is a design choice to allow all force cards to be playable in 1945;
it represents the build up of forces as the war progressed. Furthermore, many of
the ships lost during the war had sister ships that aren’t included in the deck, and
some ships that were lost had their names given to newer ships. For instance,
carrier Lexington (CV-2) was lost in 1942, but a new carrier Lexington (CV-16)
joined the fleet in 1943.
As always, play to have fun, and if good luck abandons you, blame the guy who
shuffled the deck.

Developer’s Notes

It didn’t take long for Atlantic Storm to become a favorite of my Chicago area
gaming group. We all enjoyed the mechanics of the game as well as the historical
setting. After a few months of repeated playings, fellow Chicagoan Lou Tokarz
and I began tossing around ideas of a Pacific Version of the game. We thought
instead of fighting over convoys, the game would revolve around fighting over the
numerous island groups in the Pacific (Hawaii, Midway, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, you
get the idea). Island battles still offered three different battle possibilities (only thing
different from Atlantic Storm would be a “Land” suit instead of the “Sub” suit)
and we really didn’t think it would be an unreasonable stretch for a Marine unit
to go against an aircraft or ship. We never got to the point of putting cards/rules
together, but we did have a lot of fun tossing ideas around.
I believe it was 1999 when I first discussed the possibility of a Pacific version of
Atlantic Storm with Ben Knight. Much to my delight, Ben told me that he had
already begun the design process and already had a set of force and battle cards
created. I started to tell him of some of the ideas Lou and I had and Ben was very
excited to hear about what we had come up with. The most important (and in my
opinion, the coolest) idea of ours that Ben incorporated into the final design you
are now playing was the “Renewed Battle” card. As we discussed the idea of
fighting over island groups, it occurred to us that on more than one occasion, the
Allies came back and re-took what the Japanese had conquered earlier in the war
(“I shall return.”). Why not introduce that mechanic into the game? Rather than
fight a new battle, we came up with the idea of taking a battle that had already
been won, and bringing it back out to fight over again. Wow, what a concept! It
added uncertainty since you didn’t know when the Renewed Battle cards (at first,
there were 3 in the 60-card battle deck) were going to come out. It also added
that favorite element of any multi-player game, a chance to reel in the leader!
No longer were those big VP cards safe in front of you. This is my favorite part
of Pacific Typhoon, not just because it was mine and Lou’s idea, but because it
adds such a great new dimension to the game (unless, of course, you see your 8
VP battle card get taken away from in front of you, then you absolutely hate this
new dimension ).
It was right after WBC 2005 that I took on the formal role of developer for Pacific
Typhoon. Boy, be careful what you ask for. Over the next two years or so I worked
© 2008 GMT Games, LLC

Pacific Typhoon

24

with the playtesters as well as my local Chicago group to revise and enhance the
game. One of the key changes we made was to change the day/night battle card
mix. Originally, all 40 battle cards gave the round leader the choice of day or night.
However, after becoming familiar with the strengths/weaknesses of each type of
force card(s), we started to see fewer and fewer day battles since it became clear
that keeping the powerful carriers out of the battles were advantageous to a round
leader who plays a strong surface ship. The game started to “feel” less and less like
the Pacific War since we were not getting any big carrier battles. To correct this,
we made the change the set certain battles to day-only, others to night-only, and
a few remained day/night choice. It didn’t take long for the game to “feel” better
since we started to see a lot more action with carriers and aircraft.
All in all I’m very pleased with the end result; a game that is “true to its roots” as
compared to Atlantic Storm, but also adds its own flair as a new game. A lot has
changed since the initial ideas we had eight years ago, but what you’ve got now
is a game that I hope will be as much fun for you to play as it was for me (and my
playtesting friends in Chicago and Columbus) to develop.

						               													<description>Pacific Typhoon is a strategy card game for 3-7 players, ages 10 to adult. The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular 1998 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game setting is the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Pacific Typhoon depicts the history of the air-naval battles of the Pacific War with 40 battle cards, each of which represents an historical naval or air battle such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Surigao Strait, etc. Players compete by fighting a non-sequential series of twenty of these battles. A battle lasts for one round of play, so each player gets to play once per battle. The round-leader starts by picking one of two battle cards (he discards the unpicked one). The chosen battle card determines the year of battle. The battle card is also worth a certain number of victory points and resources to whoever wins it. The round-leader alternates after each battle, and the game ends after 20 battles (when the Battle Card deck is exhausted).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are not assigned to sides. Instead, each player has a hand of force cards that typically includes both Allied and Japanese cards. The force cards represent warships, submarines, aircraft, special weapons, and events. Non-event cards have three separate combat values: Air, Surface, and Sub. For example, the battlecruiser Kirishima has combat values of 1 air, 4 surface and 0 sub; the submarine Flasher has combat values of 0 air, 1 surface and 3 sub; the Zero fighter (Sakai) has combat values of 3 air, 0 surface and 0 sub. Force cards are also worth victory points because they can be destroyed in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the round-leader selects the battle card, he announces the &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; of battle: Air, Surface, Sub or Combined. Only the combat values in the announced suit will affect the outcome of the battle. In a Combined battle, the combat values of all three suits are added together. The round-leader also announces the time of battle: Day or Night. Some force cards are only playable in a day battle (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington), a few are only playable in a night battle, but most are playable in day or night battles. The round-leader then gets to play from his hand. He may play on one side or the other (but not both sides together). Each player after him in turn may then play on one side or the other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
