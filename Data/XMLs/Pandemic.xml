OVERVIEW

To see a Pandemic teaching video, go to:
www.zmangames.com/pandemic-online-rules.html

In Pandemic, you and your fellow players are members of a disease control team. You must work together to develop cures
and prevent disease outbreaks, before 4 deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) contaminate humanity.
Pandemic is a cooperative game. The players all win or lose together.
The goal is to discover cures for all 4 diseases. The players lose if:
• 8 outbreaks occur (a worldwide panic happens),
• not enough disease cubes are left when needed (a disease spreads too much), or,
• not enough player cards are left when needed (your team runs out of time).
Each player has a specific role with special abilities to improve the team’s chances.

Prepare the Player Deck

Set the game’s difficulty level, by using either 4, 5, or 6 Epidemic cards, for
an Introductory, Standard, or Heroic game. Remove any unused Epidemic
cards from the game.
Divide the remaining player cards into face down piles, as equal in size as
you can, so that the number of piles matches the number of Epidemic cards
you are using. Shuffle 1 Epidemic card into each pile, face down. Stack these
piles to form the Player Deck, placing smaller piles on the bottom.

3. Infect cities.
After a player is done infecting cities, the player on
their left goes next.
Players should freely give each other advice. Let
everyone offer opinions and ideas. However, the player
whose turn it is decides what to do.
Your hand can have City and Event cards in it.
City cards are used in some actions and Event cards
can be played at any time.

ACTIONS
You may do up to 4 actions each turn.
Select any combination of the actions listed below. You may do the same action
several times, each time counting as 1 action. Your role’s special abilities may change
how an action is done. Some actions involve discarding a card from your hand; all these
discards go to the Player Discard Pile.

A white line that goes off the board “wraps around”

Example: Sydney and Los Angeles are connected.

Move from a city with a research station to any other city that has a
research station.

OTHER ACTIONS
Build a Research Station

 iscard the City card that matches the city you are in to place a research
D
station there. Take the research station from the pile next to the board. If all
6 research stations have been built, take a research station from anywhere
on the board.

Treat Disease

Remove 1 disease cube from the city you are in, placing it in the cube
supply next to the board. If this disease color has been cured (see
Discover a Cure below), remove all cubes of that color from the city you
are in.
If the last cube of a cured disease is removed from the board, this disease
CITY is eradicated. Flip its cure marker from its “vial” side to its “ ” side.

Share Knowledge

If more than 6 research stations were supplied,
set any extra aside during setup.

If there are cubes from several cured diseases in a
city, you must still Treat Disease once for each cured
color to remove these cubes.
Eradicating a disease is not needed to win. However,
when cities of an eradicated disease are infected, no
new disease cubes are placed there (see Epidemics
and Infections on page 6). Removing the last cube of
a disease that is not cured has no effect.

You can do this action in two ways:

If the player who gets the card now has more than 7 cards, that player must

Cure Indicator.

If no cubes of this color are on the board, this disease is now eradicated.
Flip its cure marker from its “vial” side to its “ ” side.

When a disease is cured, its cubes remain on the
board and new cubes can still be placed during
epidemics or infections (see Epidemics and
Infections on page 6). However, treating this disease
is now easier and you are closer to winning.

TURN END
OUTBREAKS

After infecting cities and discarding Infection cards, your turn is over.
The player on your left begins a turn.

When a disease outbreak occurs, move the outbreaks marker forward
1 space on the Outbreaks Track. Then, place 1 cube of the disease color
on every city connected to the city. If any of them already has 3 cubes of
the disease color, do not place a 4th cube in those cities. Instead, in each of
them, a chain reaction outbreak occurs after the current outbreak is done.

ROLES
Each player has a role with special abilities to improve your team’s chances.
CONTINGENCY
PLANNER

• As an action, take any discarded
Event card and store it on this card.
• When you play the stored Event
card, remove it from the game.
Limit: 1 Event card on this card at a
time, which is not part of your hand.

CONTINGENCY PLANNER
The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an
Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile
and place it on his Role card. Only 1 Event card can be
on his role card at a time. It does not count against his
hand limit.

When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on his role card,
remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).

DISPATCHER

DISPATCHER

OPERATIONS
EXPERT

The Operations Expert may, as an action, either:

• As an action, build a research
station in the city you are in
(no City card needed).
• Once per turn as an action, move
from a research station to any city
by discarding any City card.

• Move another player’s pawn as if it
were yours.
• As an action, move any pawn to a
city with another pawn.
Get permission before moving
another player’s pawn.

• move another player’s pawn, if its owner agrees,
as if it were his own.

When moving a player’s pawn as if it were your own, discard cards
for Direct and Charter Flights from your hand. A card discarded for a
Charter Flight must match the city the pawn is moving from.

QUARANTINE
SPECIALIST

• Prevent disease cube placements
(and outbreaks) in the city you are
in and all cities connected to it.

RESEARCHER

The Dispatcher can only move other players’ pawns; he may not direct
them to do other actions, such as Treat Disease.
MEDIC

MEDIC

• You may give any 1 of your City cards
when you Share Knowledge. It need not
match your city. A player who Shares
Knowledge with you on their turn can
take any 1 of your City cards.

The Medic removes all cubes, not 1, of the same color
when doing the Treat Disease action.
	
	
	

• Remove all cubes of one color when
doing Treat Disease.
• Automatically remove cubes of
cured diseases from the city you
are in (and prevent them from being
placed there).

If a disease has been cured, he automatically removes 	
all cubes of that color from a city, simply by entering it 	
or being there. This does not take an action.

The Medic’s automatic removal of cubes can occur on other players’
turns, if he is moved by the Dispatcher or the Airlift Event.

The Medic also prevents placing disease cubes (and outbreaks) of cured
diseases in his location.

COMMONLY OVERLOOKED
RULES
• You do not draw a replacement card after drawing an Epidemic card.
• You may Discover a Cure at any Research Station — the color of its
city does not need to match the disease you are curing.
• On your turn, you may take a card from another player, if you are both
in the city that matches the card you are taking.
• On your turn, you may take any City card from the Researcher (only),
if you are both in the same city.
• Y our hand limit applies immediately after getting a card from
another player.

8

• b uild a research station in his current city without
discarding (or using) a City card, or
• o nce per turn, move from a research station to any city
by discarding any City card.

The Dispatcher may not use the Operations Expert’s special
move ability when moving the Operation Expert’s pawn.

The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
• move any pawn, if its owner agrees, to any city
containing another pawn, or

OPERATIONS EXPERT

SCIENTIST

QUARANTINE SPECIALIST
The Quarantine Specialist prevents both outbreaks and
the placement of disease cubes in the city she is in
and all cities connected to that city. She does not affect
cubes placed during setup.

RESEARCHER
When doing the Share Knowledge action, the Researcher
may give any City card from her hand to another player
in the same city as her, without this card having to match
her city. The transfer must be from her hand to the other
player’s hand, but it can occur on either player’s turn.

SCIENTIST
The Scientist needs only 4 (not 5) City cards of
the same disease color to Discover a Cure for that
disease.

• You need only 4 cards of the same
color to do the Discover a Cure
action.

</rulebook>
			
						               													<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
