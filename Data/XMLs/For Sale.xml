Buy the best houses at the lowest price, force other players to spend
too much then resell your properties to make the most profit!
Content
30 House cards numbered from 1 to
30.

Aim of the game
A round of For Sale is played in two
phases. As a first step, players buy
auction houses to form a card hand.
In the second step, the players will
resell these houses for cheques.
The player who has the most money
at the end of the game is declared
winner.

30 Cheque Cards: 14 numbered 2 to
15 (two copies of each), as well as 2
of value 0, marked " Refusé".

Setting up

Course of the game

- Separate the home cards from the
cheque cards. Mix the House cards
to form the house deck, and do the
same with the cheque cards to form
the cheque deck.
- For a 4 player game, remove the
first two cards from the game
without looking at them.
- Each player receives: 3 players: 28
coins, 4 players: 21 coins, 5 players:
16 coins, with 6 players: 14 coins.
You should keep your coins hidden.
- The first player is randomly
determined.

A round of For Sale is divided into two
distinct phases. In the first phase,
players buy home cards through their
coins. In a second time, they sell
these cards for cheques.
Phase 1: Buying houses.
This phase consists of several bidding
rounds and ends when all the house
cards have been sold.
At the beginning of each round, draw
as many home cards as players and
place them face up in the center of
the table. The round ends when all
these houses were taken by the
players. The players play one after
the other in the clockwise direction
starting with the first player. In turn,
a player has two options:
Bid Or Spend.

Example of a purchase round:
Theo is the first player in this round because he won the strongest house in the
previous round.
- Theo starts by proposing a 1-piece auction.
- Marianne plays after him and offers a better 2-piece auction.
- Then it was the turn of Guilaine who outbid by offering 3 pieces.
- The round returns to Theo, who did not say his last word and which outbid 4
pieces (adding 3 pieces to his previous bet).
Marianne prefers to stop there. She takes 1 of her 2 pieces put into play (the other
goes back into the box) and takes home 8 which is the smallest available. Guilaine
follows her example: she picks up 2 of her 3 pieces and takes home 20.
Theo is the last player in the game, so he spends all of his 4 pieces and takes the
last remaining card, the 28

Bid
To bid, a player must place in front of
him, visible to all, a certain number of
pieces. The first player to bid can make
an auction of the value of his choice.
The following players must bid higher
than the last one announced.
If the turn comes back to a player who
has already bid, he can increase the
value of his bid or pass.
Spend
When a player passes, they pick up the
smaller value home card still available
at the center of the table and places it
in his hand. Then they take back half of
the coins they placed in front of them
during bidding (rounded up), the
remaining coins are removed from the
game. A player who passes is no longer
playing for the rest of the round. If you
do not have any more coins, you are
forced to pass.

End of the round
As soon as all but one players have
passed, the remaining player must
remove all the coins from the game in
front of him and take the last card from
the
center
of
the
table.
Then start a new round. The player who
took the biggest card of the previous
round becomes the first player of the
new round.
When all the cards of the house deck
are distributed between the players,
the purchase phase ends. Then go to
the sales phase.
Phase 2: Sale of houses
During this phase, the players resell the
houses acquired during the first phase
against cheques.
This phase is also made up of several
rounds and ends when all the cheques
have been distributed.

Example of a sales round:
Theo, Guilaine and Marianne simultaneously choose one of their houses in
hand and place it face down on the table. Then they all reveal it together:
- Theo played the strongest House (the 28), so he takes the cheque of bigger
available value: 13,000.
- Guilaine comes next with her house 20. She gets the biggest cheque
remaining: 12,000.
- Marianne played the lowest card (8) and therefore takes the last cheque,
the one at 0

At the beginning of each round, draw as
many cheque cards as players and place
them face up to the center of the

table. The round ends when all these
cheque have been taken by the
players.
The players all play simultaneously:
each chooses a house card from his
hand and the with face hidden in
front of him. When all the players
have chosen their card, they all reveal
it at the same time.
The player who played the highest
value home takes the highest cheque
in the center of the table, the next
one takes the highest remaining
cheque, and so on until all the players
have taken a cheque.

The players keep the cheques they
acquired in front of them, hidden,
face down. The houses played are
removed from the game.

When all the cheques in the center of
the table have been taken, the round
ends. Then start a new round in the
same way.

End of the game
The game ends when all the players
have sold their homes and therefore
all the cheques have been split
between the players.
Each player then adds the value of all
his cheques and all the coins he has
not spent during the purchase phase.
The richest player is declared the
winner. In the event of a tie, the one
to whom the most coins remain is the
same. If there is still a tie, victory is
shared.

Variant:
This will not be for everyone
To play with this variant, follow the
same rules with the following
changes:
During
the
setup,
remove from the game randomly
and without consulting 10 houses
and 10 cheques with 3 players; 3
houses and 3 cheques with 5
players. With 4 or 6 players, play
with all the cards.
During the purchase
phase, reveal one home less than
the number of players in each
round. The player who passes

first recovers all his coins but
does not receive any home card.
During the sales phase,
reveal as many cheques as players
who still have houses in hand.
When a player has played all his
houses, he stops playing.
So there will be fewer and fewer
cheques revealed as players empty
their hand. When there is only one
player left to have houses in hand,
he can directly take all the
remaining cheques from the deck.

						               													<description>For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.&amp;#10; The &amp;#195;&amp;#156;berplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &amp;Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &amp;Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &amp;Uuml;berplay edition).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rounding rule&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
