All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

2

DESIGN NOTE: Since 1809, Finland had been a semiautonomous province of the Russian Empire; before that since
time immemorial, it was a province of Sweden, thus never
an independent nation. With its own distinct language and
ethnicity, however, Finland had long had a sense of national
identity. In the course of 1917, the strain of World War I and
internal turmoil in the Russian Empire led to the downfall of
the Tsar, presenting the Finns with a window of opportunity
to make Finland an independent nation. The declaration of
independence was made in December 1917 ― a good month
before the Finnish Civil War broke out in January 1918! For
a more detailed history, see the Playbook.

1.1 Components

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The year 1918 was one of the darker chapters of our
recent history. Our country was just about to free itself
from centuries of repression and to reach a long dreamed
of independence. This beautiful moment, however, was
almost ruined by a bitter brotherly feud. The people
split into two camps, passions inflamed on both sides,
and soon blood began to flow, threatening to drown our
budding independence. The period of the civil war was
brutal and even after its end, brutalities and the desire
for revenge went on for a long time.
~ Väinö Tanner, period politician

All Bridges Burning is a board game about the Finnish Civil
War of 1917-1918, including the run-up to the conflict. It is
an adaptation of the COIN Series system for three players
recreating the military and political affairs of this historical
conflict.
All Bridges Burning depicts a formative period in Finnish
history in which the players vie for political and military
advantage in the power vacuum created by the collapse of
Russian Tsarist rule in Finland, at the time a semi-autonomous province of Russia. The Reds seek to stage a successful
revolt to establish socialist rule in the country. The white
Senate Faction seeks to suppress the leftist revolt while also
establishing the bourgeoisie as the leading ruling Faction in
the country. The blue, non-violent Moderates Faction fight
for the political survival of parliamentary democracy as
well as to keep national sentiment conciliatory enough for a
post-conflict settlement. In addition, two Non-player external
Powers—Russia (brown) and Germany (gray)—seek to further their geopolitical aims in Finland while also providing
crucial military muscle to the Senate and the Reds.

A complete set of All Bridges Burning includes:
•	 A 20"x25½" mounted game board (1.2)
•	 A deck of 47 Event cards (5.0)
•	 17 Solitaire system cards (8.0)
•	 88 wooden pieces
◦	 20 red octagonal pieces, embossed
◦	 20 white octagonal pieces, embossed
◦	 6 blue octagonal pieces, embossed
◦	 3 red discs
◦	 2 blue discs
◦	 6 gray cubes
◦	 6 brown cubes
◦	 3 red cubes
◦	 3 white cubes
◦	 2 red cylinders, embossed
◦	 2 white cylinders, embossed
◦	 2 blue cylinders, embossed
◦	 1 gray cylinder, embossed
◦	 6 tan and 6 green pawns
	 (Note that some spare wooden pieces are included.)
•	 A sheet of markers
•	 This Rules of Play booklet
•	 A Playbook booklet
•	 Three 6-sided dice: 1 red, 1 white, 1 blue
•	 3 Faction player aid foldouts, each including the German
Actions Flowchart
•	 1 Sequence of Play and Attack Procedure sheet
•	 1 Solitaire Play Aid sheet

1.2 Map

The map shows central and southern Finland divided into
two types of spaces, Towns and Provinces.
In addition, the map contains the Available Forces boxes for
each Faction and Power, the Polarization Track (1.10), the
Political Display (1.11), the edge track for tracking Resources
(1.5), Cells on map (1.8) and Victory (7.0), the Sequence of Play
track (2.0), the Prisoners of War box (6.5), Railways (1.2.2),
as well as Landing Site symbols for the German forces (3.4).

Leftover Factions can be controlled by Non-players (8.0).

In addition, the game involves pieces of two external Powers:
•	 Germany (gray)
•	 Russia (brown)

1 	 German Landing Site (with associated die roll range)
2 	 Town (with a Population value; e.g., Tampere “1”)
3 	 Railway and Train symbols (1.2.2)
4 	 Control and Support/Opposition marker slots (for each
Town and Province)
1.2.1 Towns and Provinces. Each Town and Province shows
a Population of 0 to 2, can be Controlled (1.7), and can have
different levels of Support or Opposition (1.6). Towns and
Provinces are the only two types of spaces in play.
1.2.2 Railways. Railways (with circled Train text) connect
spaces and are traversed using Train Capability markers (5.3).
PLAY NOTE: Unlike Lines of Communication (LoCs) in
many previous COIN volumes, Railways go through Provinces
and do not constitute borders between spaces.
1.2.3 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of pieces
and the implementation of certain Events. Any two spaces
that border on (touch) one another are adjacent.
NOTE: Sea areas are not in play and do not affect adjacency.
1.2.4 Borders. Each space is considered to have a separate
border with each space they touch (e.g. for the purposes of
placing Sabotage, 4.2.3).
DESIGN NOTE: At the time of the conflict depicted in the
game, Finland was a rural society with industrialization and
urbanization only just beginning to occur. Historically, with
the exception of the capital Helsinki, most of the Towns on the
map had smaller populations than the Provinces surrounding
them. In the game, the Population values allocated to different
spaces reflect not only their historical populations, but also
their political and economic importance.

1.3 Players, Factions, and Powers

This game may have up to three players, each as one of these
Factions:
•	 Reds (red)

DESIGN NOTE: Historically, the Reds represented the Finnish working class and the Red Guard militias were their military wing. Politically the Reds were represented by the Finnish
Social Democratic Party and Labor Unions. On the other side,
the Senate White Guard militias drew political support from
the bourgeoisie and nobility. The Whites came to be referred
to as the Senate forces because the Red Revolt of January 1918
was aimed at overthrowing a bourgeoisie-controlled Senate and
replaced it with a socialist system of people’s committees. As
late as the General Election of October 1917, the leader of the
Finnish Senate had still been the soon-to-be Red Revolt leader
Oskari Tokoi. The Playbook provides a more detailed account
of why the game also features a third Moderates Faction.
1.3.1 Friends and Enemies. Each Faction is enemy to all others. Germany is friendly to the Senate, Russia to the Reds,
while each are enemies of the remaining Factions.
IMPORTANT: The Powers are
active in Phase II of the game
only (2.4). German actions occur
during Event cards with the German Action Phase at the top (3.4)
and are determined by the accompanying flowchart. The Reds
player may use Russian Troops in
Attacks (3.2.4) and March (3.2.5)
Commands. The Russians never
act independently.
1.3.2 Negotiations. Players may make any mutual arrangements within the rules. All negotiations are open. The rules
do not bind players to agreements.
Each Faction may voluntarily transfer Resources (1.5) to each
other at any time while one of them is executing a Command,
Special Activity, or Event.

1.4 Forces

Forces in play include the following wooden pieces:
Troops of Russia and Germany (brown and gray
cubes, respectively)
NOTE: Some Russian Troops begin the game on the map
while all German Troops begin Out of Play (set aside). The
Powers become active only in Phase II of the game (2.4).

Cells of the Reds (red), Senate (white) and
Moderates (blue) Factions

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

4
Networks of the Moderates
Administrations of the Reds

In addition, certain Capabilities (5.3)—like Cannons, Trains,
Commander, and Jaeger—as well as the Prepared markers
(1.4.4, 4.2.3) enhance the fighting efficiency of the Reds and
the Senate Factions.
DESIGN NOTE: The Reds and Senate Cells represent different sized groups of people—mostly men, sometimes also
women and children—who either were active actors for, or
otherwise supported, the cause of a particular Faction. They
rarely had more than rudimentary military training. The
Moderates Cells represent individuals and small groups, often
politicians or cultural figures, actively pursuing conciliatory
initiatives—such as truce negotiations or other dialogue—to
stop the bloodshed and return to parliamentary democracy.
1.4.1 Active, Inactive, and Underground. The
Senate and Reds Cells are either Inactive
(symbol-end down) or Active (symbol-end up). The Moderates’ Cells are either Underground (symbol-end down) or
Active (symbol-end up). Always place new Cells in Inactive
or Underground status, unless modified by Event text. A
Cell’s status affects the execution of some Commands and
Special Activities. Troops, Networks, Administrations, and
other pieces do not have any comparable status.
IMPORTANT NOTE to Experienced Coin Series Players:
The way All Bridges Burning treats Inactive/Active status
is practically polar opposite to how it has functioned in
most other volumes of the COIN Series. Pay close attention!
DESIGN NOTE: The game’s treatment of the Active/Inactive
status of Senate and Red Cells reflects the difference between
being a more or less passive supporter of a Faction (Inactive) and being an engaged, committed supporter (Active),
prepared to undertake drastic action on their Faction’s behalf
(like Terror, 3.2.3). The Moderates’ Cells would, by contrast,
focus on remaining undetected or otherwise unidentifiable as
supporters of the Faction (Underground), but many actions
will necessitate exposing themselves (Active).

1.4.2 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. The inventory
shown on the Available Forces chart at the back of this rule
book limits the number of pieces that may be in play. Forces
that are not on the map are kept in the Available Forces boxes
or Out of Play (see Setup on the back cover of this rule book).
•	 Forces may only be placed from, or replaced with, those
that are available—ignore any instructions to place forces
if the appropriate type is not available because all are
already on the map (remove, rather than replace, such
pieces). EXCEPTION: A player Faction executing a Command,
Special Activity, or Event may remove its own pieces—and the
Moderates their Personality (1.4.4)—to Available Forces.
	 EXAMPLE: Factions without Available pieces could remove
Cells from one space in order to place them in another, or the
same, space.
•	 Once an enemy Faction is targeted, pieces must be
removed to the maximum extent of the executing Faction’s
ability.
	 EXAMPLE: When Polarization is six or more, Terror may
remove up to two pieces—if there are at least that many among
those Factions targeted in the space.
•	 Pieces that are Out of Play (per Setup, back cover) are
placed next to the board within reach.
1.4.3 Stacking. The following Stacking rules apply:
•	
Networks and Administration. At most two
Network or Administration discs (in total, for
Moderates and Reds combined) may occupy a single Town
or Province.
•	
Capabilities. Any number of
Capability markers may be
stacked in a space provided there
is a friendly Cell there. However,
at most two Capability markers per Faction may be used
in an Attack to affect the Attack Strength (5.3).
•	
Prepared. At most one Prepared marker per
Faction may be stacked in a space (1.4.4).

•	

Terror. At most, two Terror markers
total, of all colors, may exist in a space
(3.2.3).
Ignore any instructions (such as from Commands or Events),
and remove markers accordingly, if Stacking would be violated.
IMPORTANT: Capabilities, the Personality, and Prepared
markers are not placed with any particular Cell, but they
nonetheless require the presence of at least one friendly
Cell, otherwise remove the marker.

1.4.4 Personality and Prepared Markers. The Moderates
Personality marker abstractly represents certain historical
individuals and impacts certain Moderates Commands and
Special Activities. The Reds and Senate Prepared markers
represent military preparations—from establishing defensive

© 2020 GMT Games, LLC

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules
positions to stashing weapons, ammunition, and other such
materials. Prepared markers impact Terror (3.2.3) and Attack
(3.2.4) Commands.
IMPORTANT: On-map Personality and Prepared markers
must always be accompanied by at least one friendly Cell,
otherwise remove the marker.
PLAY NOTE: The different persons printed on the two sides
of the Personality marker have no effect on game play.

1.5 Resources

At any moment, each Faction has 0 to 30 Resources that it uses to pay for its actions. Mark
Resources on the edge track with a cylinder
of the Faction’s color (1.3).
DESIGN NOTE: In All Bridges Burning, Resources represent political capital or political will to mobilize and command
the supporters of a particular Faction. Therefore some game
actions, such as Rally (3.2.1) in a space with a history of enemy Terror (3.2.3), or Attack (3.2.4) against a more powerful
enemy, might require a larger injection of will to motivate
the supporters.

1.6 Support and Opposition

Support and Opposition affect Victory, as well as some Commands and Special Activities.
Towns and Provinces always show one of the five levels of
Support or Opposition to the Senate that can shift during play:
Neutral
Active Support or Opposition counts double the space’s
Population for Total Opposition—affecting Reds Victory (7.0).
Show Active or Passive Support or Opposition with markers
placed in each Town or Province. Show Neutral spaces by
the absence of such markers.
NOTE: Zero Population Provinces may hold Support and
Opposition markers. Opposition there does not contribute
to Reds Victory (7.0). Support in a zero Population Province
does contribute to Senate Propaganda Round earnings (6.3),
as well as to the efficiency and cost of Rally (3.2.1).
DESIGN NOTE: All Bridges Burning simulates a period in
which the state’s authority and institutions were increasingly
evaporating and being replaced by local voluntary militias of
the Red and White Guards. For this reason, the game does
not contain game pieces comparable to the police as we know
them from many of the published games in the COIN Series.
Support and Opposition represent people’s backing of the
aims of a given Faction, and the fluctuating preparedness to
show this publicly.

5

1.7 Control

The Reds, or the Senate, Control a
space if their Cells plus Administrations there exceed those of both
other Factions combined (include
Moderates pieces, exclude German and Russian Troops);
otherwise the space is Uncontrolled. Neither the Moderates
nor the German or Russian Powers ever Control any spaces—
although the presence of Moderates Cells and Networks (but
not the Personality) may deny Control.
NOTE: The zero Population spaces may hold Control
markers.

1.8 Cells On Map

Use the Cells on Map marker to track the total
combined number of Reds and Senate Cells on
the map. The position of the marker affects the
transition to Phase II of the game (see 2.4).

1.9 Vassalage

German and Russian Troop involvement in the game depends on the
status of the Russian and German
Vassalage markers. Use the Vassalage markers to mark their levels on the edge track. Certain
Events, the Foreign Relations Special Activity (4.2.2), and
Russian Turmoil during the Propaganda Round (6.4.1), may
shift Vassalage. The number of German and Russian Troops
on the map is adjusted during the Propaganda Rounds of
Phase II (6.5), as well as when the Red Revolt! Pivotal Event
is played (2.4)—to match the level indicated by the Vassalage
markers.
DESIGN NOTE: In the game, the Vassalage levels represent
the measure of foreign influence in Finland; that is, the degree
of Finnish dependence on Germany or Russia. See also 1.10
below.

1.10 Polarization

Also among the Whites it has been, they say, difficult to
control the soldiers from lynching prisoners after they
had seen the bloody acts committed by the Reds or had
heard of them. It looks like this war will turn out to be
very bloody and bitter.
~ Juhani Aho (1918), novelist

The Polarization marker on the Polarization track
indicates the level of national unity between the
Factions. Certain Events, Commands, Special
Activities, and the number of Prisoners of War
during a Propaganda Round, affect the level of Polarization.
The position of the Polarization marker also affects Victory
(7.0), determines the cost of the Moderates’ Politics (3.3.4)
and Rally Commands (3.3.1), as well as the efficiency of Terror (3.2.3), as printed below the track.

The Polarization Track.
DESIGN NOTE: Most historical political actors of the period
wanted full Finnish national independence after a century of
Russian rule. The declaration of Finnish independence was
indeed made in December 1917, only a few weeks before the
Finnish Civil War broke out. Arguably, an important prerequisite for independence was national unity that, needless to
say, was under great strain during the bloody civil war ― in
the space of about six months, an estimated 37,000 people of a
total population of about 3 million died in the conflict and its
aftermath. Nonetheless in the two decades that followed, the
divisions were mended such that Finland was able to preserve
its independence throughout World War II and the Cold War.
In Finnish literature, the conflict is sometimes referred to as a
“war between brothers” (veljessota), a reference to the conflict
having been a civil war as well as a war between parties that
shared a certain fundamental goal and identity: the independence of Finland.

1.11 Political Display

The Political Display consists of a semicircle (the
“chamber”) with boxes in two of the Faction colors,
as well as three boxes, each representing an historical political Issue. Using Politics (3.3.4) and Terror (3.2.3), as well as
certain Events, the Factions may place or remove cubes in
the semicircle. This represents their level of political engagement for a given issue.
IMPORTANT: The Politics Command (3.3.4) may not be
used to place cubes if Polarization is 6 or greater.

The Faction Contributions part of the display can be thought
of as a parliamentary chamber. A Faction’s cubes on this
display indicate their political will to contribute to
Resolving a given Issue.
DESIGN NOTE: The Finnish Civil War was, to a significant
part, fought over the badly needed social reforms represented
by the three Issues named in this game (deriving from the
Social Democratic Party manifesto of late 1917). The Political Display recreates that political struggle for reforms that
went on in the background of the happenings in the Towns
and Provinces. It also represents the hypothetical effects of (in
terms of the increased cost to Senate and Reds Agitation) the
preparedness of the Finnish people to support a given cause
once some reforms had been achieved.

1.12 Victory Markers

Various totals affect Victory (7.0) and are tracked using markers on the edge track:
•	 Town Population under Senate Control
•	 Russian and German Vassalage levels on the edge track
•	 Opposition and Administrations on the map
•	 Networks on map and Resolved political Issues

DESIGN NOTE: The work of Finland’s Parliament was frequently interrupted in the run-up to the civil war, and came
to a complete halt during the war.
1.11.1 Resolving Issues. Issues are
either Unresolved (no marker) or
marked as Resolved. Resolve the
Political Display during the Politics
Phase (6.2) of each Propaganda Round.
A Faction’s cubes are placed to contribute to up to one Unresolved Issue at a time, moving to the next issue only as the
previous one has been Resolved (see 6.2). The players may
select any one Unresolved Issue they desire (the Issues are
named for thematic effect only).
IMPORTANT: Resolved Issues affect Moderates Victory
(7.0), as well as the cost of Reds and Senate Agitation (6.2).

card. The next Eligible Faction now has the option to Pass or
execute an action.

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

2.2.3 Options for Eligible Factions. The Sequence of Play
track shows the options Available to the next Eligible Faction.

2.1 Set Up and Start

Set up the deck as instructed in Setup (see back cover of this
manual). Then, reveal the current Event card and the top
card of the draw deck to be played as the upcoming Event.

2.2 Event Card

When playing an Event card, one to potentially all three Factions may execute Commands, implement the Event, or Pass.
•	 Any Faction whose cylinder is in the Eligible box selects
from these options in the order “1st,” “2nd,” then “3rd,”
based on which space they occupy.
•	 A Faction with its cylinder in the Ineligible Faction box
does nothing.
•	 If the card has the German Action Phase symbol at the top,
and the game is in Phase II (2.4), the Germans will attempt
to execute actions (3.4).
RECORD STEPS. Use the Faction and German cylinders
to mark the actions taken on the Sequence of Play track.
The German cylinder may only occupy the circles marked
“Germany.”

FIRST ELIGIBLE: The first Faction to play (unless they Pass)
determines the horizontal row from which each following
Faction must choose their action. The first Eligible Faction
must select the first action box of that row:
•	 A Limited Command (Lim Cmd, 2.2.4); or
•	 Command (Cmd), with or without a Special Activity (SA,
4.0); or
•	 The Event shown on the current card.
SECOND ELIGIBLE: The second Eligible Faction has a choice
between Pass and the two action boxes remaining in the row
selected by the first Eligible Player.
THIRD ELIGIBLE: The third Eligible Faction may choose
between Pass and any remaining action boxes in the row
selected by the first Eligible Player.
IMPORTANT: Unlike in many COIN System games for
four Factions, in All Bridges Burning the third Eligible Faction may also take an action on each Event card.
2.2.4 Limited Command. A Limited Command is a Command
in just one space with no Special Activity. A Limited Command constrains the usual execution of a full Command, as
specified where relevant in 3.0 Commands.
EXAMPLE: The Message Command (3.3.2) taken as a Limited
Command may move a single Cell only.
PLAY NOTE: If the Senate or Reds player holds a News
marker and conducts a Limited Command only (2.2.4), they
may discard the marker and immediately conduct an additional
non-free Limited Command (see NEWS in 3.3.2).

The Sequence of Play track.
2.2.1 Faction Order. At the game start, determine the Faction
order randomly and place the cylinders of the three Factions
on the “1st,” “2nd,” and “3rd” spot in the Eligible Factions
box of the Sequence of Play track. Thereafter, the Faction
Eligibility order is dictated solely by the actions that the
Factions choose to take.
IMPORTANT: In All Bridges Burning, the Event cards do
not have Faction symbols printed on the top row, as is familiar in other COIN Series games. Rather, Eligibility order
depends solely upon the actions taken by the Factions.
2.2.2 Passing. If a Faction opts to Pass, move its cylinder to the
first available spot (A, B, or C) in the Pass box. This Faction
receives a Resource and remains Eligible for the upcoming

2.2.5 Adjust Eligibility.
FACTIONS. After each Eligible Faction has either Passed
or executed an action, shift all Faction cylinders to Eligible
again, except that of the Faction that chose Command and
Special Activity—it goes to Ineligible. As a reminder for this,
the “Cmd + SA” boxes on the Sequence of Play track are
highlighted in a darker gray color.
The Factions return to the Eligible Factions box in alphabetical
order of the letters in the respective boxes:
1)	 From the Pass box [a]
2)	 From the Ineligible box [b]
3)	 From the Command or Event boxes [c]/[d]
POWERS. After the German Power has taken actions, store
their cylinder in the space marked “Germany,” below the
Ineligible box, until called upon by the German Action Phase
symbol on a future Event card.
EXAMPLE 1: The first Eligible Faction chooses to play a Limited
Command. This player places the Faction cylinder in the corresponding box (“Lim Cmd” [d]), thereby forcing the other Fac-

8

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

tions to choose between the “Pass,” [a] “Cmd (may add Special
Activity),” and the remaining “Lim Cmd” [c] boxes. Suppose
the second Eligible Faction chooses to Pass. They then receive a
Resource and place their cylinder in the Pass box (selecting the
first available circle in alphabetical order). The third Eligible
Faction may choose between the same three options as the second
Eligible Faction above. Now, suppose they also Pass. The Factions return to Eligible: first the two Factions that Passed—in
alphabetical order, according to the circles in which the cylinders
are located—followed by the one who chose the Limited Command. No Faction chose the “Cmd (may add Special Activity)”
option, therefore no Faction becomes Ineligible.
EXAMPLE 2: The first Eligible Faction chooses to execute “Cmd
(may add Special Activity).” Then the second Eligible Faction
chooses to execute the Event, thus placing their cylinder in the
“Event” [c] box. The third Eligible Faction chooses to execute a
Limited Command, placing their cylinder in the “Lim Cmd” [d]
box. Now the Faction cylinders are adjusted. The first Eligible
Faction, with their cylinder in the “Cmd (may add a Special
Activity)” box, becomes Ineligible. Looking at the circled letters
in the actions boxes, the Faction that chose “Event” [c] goes
to the Eligible box first, followed by the cylinder in the “Lim
Cmd” [d] box. The former Faction’s cylinder is placed in the
circle marked “1st” and the latter’s in the circle marked “2nd”
in the Eligible box.
2.2.6 Next Card
After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s top card
onto the played-cards pile, face-up, and reveal the draw
deck’s next card. Play the new card, proceeding with the
appropriate sequence. If the revealed card is a Propaganda
card, see 2.3 below.

2.3 Propaganda Cards

When a Propaganda Card is revealed as the upcoming card,
immediately swap it with the current Event card and conduct
a Propaganda Round (see 6.0). The swapped card will then
be the first card played in the next round of play.
2.3.1 Final Propaganda. If there is no Victory in the fourth
Propaganda card’s Victory Phase (6.1), continue through
the Support Phase only (6.4), and end the game: determine
Victory by 7.3.
PLAY NOTE: Set aside Propaganda cards to display and keep
track of the number played so far. Each series of Event cards
up to a Propaganda Round is called a “Campaign.”

2.4 Phase I & II and Pivotal Event

Card #24 Red Revolt! is a transitional Pivotal
Event that moves the game from Phase I to Phase
II. This card belongs to no Faction and may not
be played by any Faction. It is kept aside and is
not shuffled into the deck.
Instead, if 27 or more Reds + Senate Cells, combined, are
ever on the map at the conclusion of a Faction’s turn, the next
Event is discarded without effect, and the Pivotal Event is
immediately placed there as its replacement.
If this condition is not met before the end of the second Propaganda Round, the Pivotal Event is placed as the first card
after the Propaganda (see 6.5), replacing the Event card there.
Discard the replaced card.
2.4.1 Playing the Red Revolt! Pivotal Event. When the Pivotal Event becomes the current Event, the Red Revolt begins.
Before any Factions may act, conduct the following steps:
1.	 Regardless of Eligibility status, move the Reds cylinder
as if they had taken an Event action, that is, place it in the
bottom-row Event box of the Sequence of Play display.
2.	 The Reds may either select one Town with any Reds
Cells and remove all Senate Cells there (and any Senate
Prepared markers) or conduct a free Limited Command
Rally in one Town with existing Reds pieces.
3.	 First the Reds, then the Senate, place any Capability
markers (5.3) with on-map Cells of theirs as follows. The
Reds may place their markers with any of their on-map
Cells. The Senate must place Jaeger markers in Vaasa
(or if no white Cells there, in the closest space that does
contain white Cells, Senate player’s choice if more than
one candidate). Other Capability markers may be placed
anywhere along a continuous line of adjacent spaces
formed by Vaasa and spaces with Senate Cells.
4.	 Place the number of German Troops from Out of Play
to the German Forces box corresponding to the current
level of German Vassalage (1.9). Remove random Russian
Troops, or place new ones, in one random Town with Reds
pieces, corresponding to the current Russian Vassalage
level.
NOTE: Some Russian Troops are already on the map
at the game start.

	
The game now enters Phase II. The German and Russian
Powers become active (3.4). An additional set of Commands
and Special Activities (3.0, 4.0) become immediately available to the Reds and Senate Factions (see also the provided
Faction aid sheet).
Now continue play normally: any remaining Eligible Factions may conduct actions as if Red Revolt! were a regular
Event card.

DESIGN NOTE: Historically the Reds were quite unprepared
for the Red Revolt. Historian Risto Alapuro wrote (1988: 169):
“A total seizure of power was not feasible: taking care of the
administration and of other basic tasks of the state seemed to be
beyond the party’s capacity. Even the militant worker guards
did not envision a social revolution. As one Social Democratic
leader put it in his diary during the [general] strike [of November 1917]: ‘The revolution is preposterous, we cannot force
the civil servants to obey when we cannot even force them to
go on strike. ...As a consequence of our lack of intellectuals,
we shall not be able to master the machinery of government.’”
Accordingly, the Reds viewed the Red Revolt as a defensive
effort (Alapuro 1988: 172): “After encounters with the bourgeois guards in several localities, and after the civil guards
gained official status as governmental troops, it was decided,
with great reluctance, to launch the revolution on 27 January. Not surprisingly, it was described as having ‘a defensive
character.’”

3.0 COMMANDS
3.1 Commands in General

A Faction executing a Command (Cmd) chooses one of up to
five Commands listed on its Faction sheet, and selects the map
spaces and/or pieces (from one to several) to be involved.
Select a given space only once for any given Command. EXCEPTION: Moderates Message (3.3.2) may use the same selected
spaces as the movement path of multiple Cells.
Commands usually cost Resources, often per space selected;
the paying Faction must have enough Resources to pay for
the Command, including in each selected space. Powers do
not spend any Resources.
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in
which the Command is resolved, the enemy Factions (1.3.1)
or pieces to be affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces to
be placed, replaced, or moved.
Once targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum
extent possible. Actions affecting another Faction’s pieces,
friendly or enemy, do not require that Faction’s permission.
3.1.1 Pawns. If desired, mark spaces selected for
Commands (3.0), Special Activities (4.0), or other
actions with green and tan pawns. The pawns are
for convenience only and are not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Commands. Certain Events (5.0) grant free Commands or Special Activities: they cost no Resources and, if
executed by a Faction other than the one playing an Event,
do not affect its Eligibility (2.0).
EXCEPTION: Agitation still costs Resources even if part of a
free Activism Command (3.2.2).
Other requirements and procedures still apply, unless modified by the Event text (5.1, 5.4).

Committee as the Reds launched the revolt in January 1918.

NOTE: The cost of Offsetting the effects of Support, Opposition, and Terror on the placing of Cells via the Rally
Command (3.2.1, 3.3.1) is free if the Command is free. A
free March may move any number of pieces without cost
(subject to rules about Limited Command March, 3.2.5).
EXAMPLE: A free Reds Rally in a space with Active Support
and a white Terror marker (or markers) costs no Resources and
places one Reds Cell.
EXAMPLE: A free Moderates Negotiate Command (3.3.3) costs
no Resources, but requires an Underground Moderates Cell to
be Activated.

3.2 Reds and Senate Commands

The Senate and the Reds choose from Rally, Activism, Terror—and in Phase II, also from Attack and March Commands.
NOTE: If the Senate or Reds player holds a News marker
and conducts a Limited Command only (2.2.4), they may
discard the marker and immediately conduct an additional
non-free Limited Command (see NEWS in 3.3.2).
3.2.1 Rally. Rally places friendly Cells and, for Reds, Administrations. Select any spaces up to the level of Polarization
(1.10)—you may always select at least two spaces. Pay one
Resource per selected space, and possibly more to Offset the
effects of Support, Opposition, and Terror.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected space, determine then
place the number of friendly Cells as follows. Starting the
count with one Cell to be placed in the space, add or subtract
the following from the total:
•	Senate: +1 for each level of Support, –1 for each Red Terror
and each level of Opposition
•	Reds: +1 for each level of Opposition, –1 for each White
Terror and each level of Support
Then the Reds may—in up to one selected space in which no
Cells were placed above—replace two Reds Cells with their
Administration.
OFFSETTING: The Faction placing Cells via Rally may use
their Resources to Offset the negative effects of Terror and
Support or Opposition on Rally in the space—one Resource
for each marker and/or level.
EXAMPLE: In a space with two White Terror markers and Passive Opposition, the Reds calculate the number of Cells they may
place as follows. They may place one Cell for selecting the Rally
space and another Cell for Passive Opposition there, minus two
Cells—one for each White Terror marker present. This yields a
total placement of zero Cells. The Reds, however, have the option
of paying Resources to Offset the effects of white Terror: one
paid Resource cancels the effect of one Terror marker, allowing
the placement of one Reds Cell, two paid Resources, two Cells.
DESIGN NOTE: The players will note that Phase I of the game
(2.4) does not have a Command that allows the Senate and
the Reds to move their forces around—the March Command
(3.2.5) is available in Phase II only. This design choice reflects
the local, non-organized nature of the conflict: initially, the
Red and the White Guards would spring up and be active in
their respective home localities only. No significant movement
of forces occurred until the war phase of the conflict.

3.2.2 Activism. Activism reveals enemy Cells and Activates
or removes friendly Cells, in the latter case allowing the executing Faction to reduce Polarization (1.10). The Reds (only)
may use Activism to Agitate, shifting Support or Opposition.
Select any spaces. Pay one Resource per selected space.
PROCEDURE: First, if desired, either
•	 remove up to one Active friendly Cell in each selected
space, reducing Polarization by one for each removed
Cell; or
•	 in each selected space, flip one enemy Cell (from Active to
Inactive, or vice versa) per each one Active friendly Cell,
and one for every two Inactive friendly Cells there.
Then, if desired, up to once during this Command, either
•	 select no spaces and pay one Resource, roll 1d6, and
Activate up to the roll-value of friendly Inactive Cells,
evenly* anywhere on the map; or
•	 the Reds only may choose up to one selected space with
both a Reds Administration and Reds Control to Agitate
there paying an additional Resource for each: first to
remove all Terror (if any there, either color), then to shift
up to one level towards Active Opposition. Resolved
Issues in the Political Display may impose additional costs
(1.11, 6.2).

	

	

* NOTE: “Evenly” means more than one Inactive
friendly Cell may be Activated in a given space only
after at least one Inactive friendly Cell per each selectable space has been Activated during this Command.
NOTE: If conducting a Limited Command (3.1), choose
any one of the four bullet point options above. A Limited Command may be used to roll a 1d6 and Activate
friendly Cells anywhere on the map.

EXAMPLE: See Playbook, page 10.
DESIGN NOTE: When enemy Cells are Deactivated or
revealed, Activism represents house searches and confiscations, and other intimidation conducted by the Red and White
Guards during the conflict. When friendly Cells are Activated,
Activism represents political organization and agitation to
radicalize and turn passive supporters into active ones. When
Activism is used to target friendly active Cells, this action
represents attempts to deradicalize and pacify own supporters. Historically, in the Spring of 1918, when the Reds’ cause
increasingly began to seem lost, more conciliatory writings
began to appear in working class newspapers. Similar efforts
at deradicalization were made among Senate forces as terror
and personal retribution threatened to get out of hand (see
e.g., Event #37 VATO).

3.2.3 Terror.

We’ve had Red terror, will we have to have White terror
as well? The road for it is being paved, public opinion is
being prepared for it.
~ Juhani Aho (1918), novelist

Terror removes enemies and cubes in the
Political Display and also places markers
that make future enemy Rally Commands
in the space more costly. Select the Political Display (1.11)
and/or any spaces with the executing Faction’s Active Cells
and enemy pieces. Pay one Resource per selected space and
the Political Display. Powers’ Troops may not be targeted.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, place an Available
Terror marker there; Reds place red, Senate white Terror
markers. In Phase II, if placing the second Terror marker in
a space, also place an available News marker there. Then, if
the Political Display was selected, remove a cube of any color
there. If a Town or Province space is selected, remove up to
one enemy—or up to two, if Polarization (1.10) is at six or
more—there. Within the above:
•	 Remove Administrations and Networks only after all Cells
of that Faction in the space have been removed.
•	 Remove the Personality with the last Moderates Cell. If
the Personality is removed, the Moderates must transfer
three Resources to the executing Faction.
•	 Terror may never remove the last enemy Cell if that would
lead to the removal of a Capability or a Prepared marker.
•	 Place all removed pieces in Available.
Lastly, increase Polarization by one for each Terror marker
placed during this Command. A maximum of two Terror
markers (irrespective of color) may exist simultaneously in
a space.
NOTE: The Political Display is not considered a space,
therefore Terror does not place a Terror marker when a
cube is removed there.
DESIGN NOTE: In the historical conflict, Terror took many
forms, from more or less unplanned personal acts of revenge
to organized persecution, violence, and executions. Elsewhere
in the COIN Series, Terror has been conceptualized as serving
to undermine state authority by illustrating its inability to
protect its citizens. In the context of the Finnish Civil War,
however, the power vacuum left by the demise of Russian rule
in Finland meant that there was no central state authority to
undermine. Gradually, central state authority disappeared
altogether and local militias took over in its place. Accordingly,
in All Bridges Burning, Terror is conceived as a weapon of
intimidation: it deters an enemy Faction’s support for their
cause. This is explicitly simulated by the removal of enemy
pieces and the additional cost of the enemy’s Rally Command
(3.2.1) in spaces with a history of enemy Terror.

11

3.2.4 Attack. Attack removes enemy pieces (including those
of the Powers, but excluding Moderates Cells and Networks).
Select any spaces with both the executing Faction’s Cells and
removable enemy pieces, and pay one Resource per selected
space. This Command may be selected in Phase II only (2.4).
No piece or Capability may participate in more than one
Attack per turn.
TRAINS IN ATTACK: A Train
marker placed with Attacking pieces
enables Cells and any Capabilities to
Attack into an adjacent space. There
must, however, be a Railway line across an Unsabotaged
border (see 1.2.2) between the origin and target spaces. The
first three moving Cells Attack for the cost of selecting the
target space, thereafter pay one Resource per each additional three Cells (round up) moving into a selected space.
Each piece and Capability may only move once.
Provinces with Train symbols, as well as Towns, constitute
destinations along the Railways (see EXAMPLE in 3.2.5
March).
Relocate the Train marker and the Attacking pieces (including any other Capability markers, if desired) to the Attack
space. After the Attack, the pieces and Capabilities stay in the
Attack space (regardless of the outcome, unless eliminated).
Any number of Trains may be stacked in Towns or Provinces
with a Train symbol.
PROCEDURE: Conduct the steps below, in order, for each
selected Attack space individually.
1.	 Designate the Attacking pieces from among any pieces
already there. Those pieces arriving by Train, if any, must
be designated as Attackers.
•	 The executing Faction is the Attacking Faction. Reds
may designate any Russian Troops in the space as
being involved in the Attack (Russian Troops may not
Attack on their own). The Senate may not designate
Germans as Attackers. The Germans never designate
Senate Cells as among the Attackers.
2.	 Designate the Defending Faction and/or Power.
•	 The Reds may designate either the Senate or the
Germans, or both, as the (joint) Defender. In Senate,
as well as German Attacks, the Reds and Russians are
automatically the joint Defender.
NOTE: Moderates Cells or Networks cannot Attack
nor be Attacked.

	
3.	 Determine the Attack Strength per the table below. The
starting Strength is zero.
	

NOTE: A maximum of two Defending or Attacking
Capabilities per Faction may affect the Attack Strength.

4.	 The Attacker may pay any amount of additional Resources
to increase the Attack Strength by one per each one
Resource spent.
IMPORTANT: Attacking Germans always get a minimum Strength of 2—even if the modifiers otherwise
would yield a lesser Strength.

	
5.	 Activate one Inactive Attacking Cell.
6.	 Roll 1d6. If the Die Roll Value is equal to or less than
the Attack Strength, remove or relocate Defenders per
CASUALTIES below. Otherwise, the Attack in that space
fails and ends immediately.
	

IMPORTANT: A “6” is an automatic failure.

CASUALTIES: Up to the Die Roll Value, the Attacker targets
the Defending pieces, choosing either of the following two
options:
1.	 Engagement. Beginning with removal to Available first,
the Attacker removes Defending Cells to Available and
then the Prisoners of War box, alternately; Troops and
Administrations go to Available; or
2.	 Retreat. Relocate Defending Cells (Capabilities, if any,
with last relocated Cell) to one adjacent space (Attacking
Faction’s choice); Troops and Administrations to
Available.
	

NOTE: The Germans always choose the option to remove Defenders to Prison and Available.
NOTE: Train markers that cannot be relocated because
of Sabotaged borders are removed.

	
Within the above:
•	 Remove Defending Cells and Troops alternately (beginning
with a Cell); within that limitation the executing Faction
decides which Defenders are removed.
NOTE: The Germans always remove Active before
Inactive enemy Cells.

	
•	 Remove defending Capability markers and Prepared
markers with the last removed Defending Cell.
•	 Remove Administrations after all defending Cells and
Troops have been removed.
NOTE: The removal of an Administration does not
remove Opposition in that space.

	
Attrition. Next, if and as applicable, remove Attackers as
follows:
•	 Remove one Attacking Cell or Russian Troop (beginning
with a Cell) per each Defending German Troop removed.
•	 Remove one Attacking Cell (to Available) per each three
enemy Cells removed.
Prisoners of War. Finally, if any targeted Defenders of an
Attack space were removed to Prison during Engagement
above:
•	 The executing Faction places a Terror marker of their
color in that Attack space, the Germans place white
Terror—a maximum of two Terror markers, irrespective
of color, may exist in a single space (1.4.3)—and increases
Polarization by one.
•	 Place an Available News marker (3.3.2) in the space.
PLAY NOTE: To avoid a Polarization-increase due to an
Attack, the Attacker may choose the option of relocating Defenders to an adjacent space instead of sending any to Prison.
EXAMPLE: See Playbook, page 19.

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules
DESIGN NOTE: The Finnish Civil War was fought using
largely untrained militias, supported by foreign forces on the
one hand, and some military Capabilities on the other. This
is reflected in a number of design choices, such as the autofail of an Attack on a die roll of “6,” the role of the Powers
and Capabilities in boosting Attack Strengths as well as the
Resource-intensive nature of Attacks in absence of modifiers.
This account by the Senate agitator and White Guard, Kyösti
Wilkuna (1918: 143-144), strikingly illustrates the make-up
of the supposedly better-trained Senate forces: “Suddenly I
hear steps and I raise my head in curiosity. Kalle C. is walking there, one of the youngest among us, 15 or 16, a mouthy,
unruly schoolboy. Bullets are flying like hail, but this rascal
walks straight and without worries. ‘It is quite remarkable
how these bullets go out of my way,’ says Kalle-boy calmly.
‘Five men I’ve seen fall around me, but I myself have not had a
scratch.’ When he is finished with his cigarette he throws the
stump carelessly away, takes his Mauser-pistol laying on the
stone, and walks back to his men. For he is our team leader!”
3.2.5 March. March moves friendly Cells (with friendly Capabilities, if desired). Select any spaces adjacent to friendly
Cells and pay one Resource per each three Cells (round up)
moving into a selected space. Each piece and Capability may
only move once during a single Command. This Command
may be selected in Phase II only (2.4).
PROCEDURE: Move friendly Cell (with Capabilities, if
desired) into adjacent selected spaces. Reds may move one
Russian Troop per each moving Reds Cell.
TRAINS IN MARCH: Train Capability markers may only
move along Railway lines (1.2.2) and via Towns—and within
that; only across Unsabotaged borders. Provinces with Train
symbols, and Towns, constitute destinations along the Railways. Each marker may only move once.

13

Häme (two red, one blue arrow). It takes two March moves for
the Train to reach a Province adjacent to Häme (blue arrows). A
Sabotage marker anywhere on the Town border would prevent
the Train from moving in or out in any direction.

3.3 Moderates Commands

There is still a great deal to be done on the objectives
and motives of the Reds and Whites, but above all,
a third group, those who remained neutral or stayed
outside the conflict, has received little or no attention.
These neutrals can be and have indeed sometimes been
called ‘Blues’.
~ Ohto Manninen (1978), historian

The Moderates choose from Rally, Message, Negotiate, and
Politics Commands.
NOTE: Unlike the Senate and the Reds, the Moderates do
not gain additional Commands in Phase II; however, some
actions have elements only usable in Phase II.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally places or hides Moderates Cells and Networks. Select any spaces and pay one Resource per selected
space, and possibly more, to Offset the effects of Support
and Opposition. Reduce the total Rally cost of the entire
Command by one Resource for each level of Polarization
(1.10) above five.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, do one of the following:
•	 Replace two Moderates Cells with a Moderates Network.
•	 If a Moderates Network is already present, flip a number
of Moderates Cells Underground up to the space’s
Population plus Moderates Networks there.
•	 Starting the count with one Cell to be placed in the space,
subtract from the total number –1 for each level of Support
or Opposition (ignore Terror).
OFFSETTING: When placing Cells above, the Moderates
may pay Resources to Offset the negative effects of Support
or Opposition, as in 3.2.1 above.
EXAMPLE: Polarization is at seven. The Moderates Rally in
Helsinki and Viipuri at neutral (cost one Resource each). The
high level of Polarization reduces the total Rally cost by two
Resources. Therefore, the Moderates’ Rally is free.
3.3.2 Message. Message moves and hides Moderates Cells, the
Personality, and News. Pay one Resource per Cell that moves.
For each moving Cell, select up to three spaces adjacent to
each other—with at least one adjacent to the moving Cell—as
movement destinations. The Personality, or up to one News
marker, may move with each moving Cell and must move
with the last moving Cell of a space (or be removed). Each
Cell may only be selected to move once.
NOTE: If conducting a Limited Command (2.2.4), move
only a single Cell (with or without News or Personality,
as desired).

EXAMPLE: Tampere is a junction in the Railway network. A
Train moving out of Tampere has three possible directions it
may travel to, arriving in all cases at different destinations in

PROCEDURE: Move each Messaging Cell—with or without
the Personality or News—up to three times each into adjacent

© 2020 GMT Games, LLC

14

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

selected spaces. Then, unless Captured (see below), flip the
Messaging Cell Underground. If desired, at any point during the Command, the moving Cell (while in the same space
with it) may pick up a News marker there that is not held
by any other Cell.
CAPTURE: Each Messaging Cell that at any time during its
movement holds News or the Personality, may be subject
to Capture. Conduct the Capture check for each such Cell
individually. From among the selected spaces, choose one
space with the most Active Cells of a single enemy Faction—and within that, choose the space closest to the News
or Personality’s starting location. If ties persist, the Moderates
player decides. Then the Moderates player rolls 1d6. If the
die roll result is:
•	 more than the number of Active enemy Cells in the space,
flip the Messaging Cell Underground (if not already) and
continue the Message movement;
•	 less than or equal to the number of Active enemies in the
chosen space, stop the Message movement in that space,
then Activate the Messaging Cell.
EXAMPLE: The Moderates have an Active blue Cell in Tampere. They pay one Resource and, among many other options,
they could now 1) select the adjacent Province of Häme, move
the Cell to Häme, then back again to Tampere, or 2) move the
Cell to Häme, then to Pohjanmaa, then to Vaasa, selecting all
those three spaces. Finally, in either case, they may flip the Cell
Underground.
EXAMPLE: The Moderates have a second Active blue Cell in
Tampere holding a News marker. The Moderates pay one Resource and move the Cell, as well as the News, to the adjacent
Province of Häme. There are three Active Senate Cells there.
Thus the Moderates must conduct a Capture check. They roll
1d6: it is a three; the moving Cell is Captured and flipped Active
(the symbol showing).
NEWS: The game uses two News markers to
represent particular pieces of important information. On the map, the markers either stand
on their own or are coupled with a Cell of the
Faction that owns the marker.
•	 News markers are placed on the map by German Landings
(see the German actions flowchart sheet), Attacks that send
Defenders to Prison (3.2.4), and by Terror (3.2.3) if placing
the second Terror marker in a space in Phase II.
•	 News markers remain on the map until the Moderates
pick up the marker (using the Message, 3.3.2). No other
Faction may pick up a News marker.
•	 The Moderates may make use of News by using the
Personality Special Activity (4.3.1).
•	 Terror (3.2.3) versus a News-carrying Moderates Cell may
cause the News marker to pass to the Reds or Senate, or
be removed. If the News-carrying Cell is removed, the
owner may immediately transfer the News to another
friendly Cell in the same space—News changes owners only
if the holding Cell is removed by Terror and there is no

other friendly Cell in the same space to which it can be
transferred.
•	 If an Event removes the last News-holding Moderates Cell
in a space, transfer the News to a Cell of the executing
Faction in that space. Otherwise, remove the News marker.
•	 After executing a Limited Command (without Special
Activity), the Senate or the Reds (only) may remove a
News marker they own and execute an additional non-free
Limited Command of any kind.
DESIGN NOTE: Aho (1918a-c) and Tanner (1949) speak
frequently of informal information networks acquiring and
spreading information about major events (see also Event #38
Tanner Abroad).
3.3.3 Negotiate. Negotiate can Deactivate enemy Cells and
may shift Polarization. Select any spaces with Underground
Moderates Cells and Active enemy Cells. Pay one Resource
per selected space.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected space, Activate an Underground Moderates Cell and Deactivate up to one Active
enemy Cell there. Then, if desired, reduce Polarization by the
total number of enemies Deactivated during this Command.
3.3.4 Politics. Politics places a cube in the Political Display
to help Resolve a political Issue (6.2). Select no spaces. Pay
up to three Resources as indicated in the Polarization track
(1.10). Moderates pieces must be present on the map, and
Polarization must be five or less. Up to one cube may be
placed during a single Politics Command.
PROCEDURE: Place a cube, if available, of either color desired by the Moderates player, in the Political Display.
EXAMPLE: The Moderates wish to conduct Politics. They have
several Cells on the map, and the Polarization track shows that
Polarization is three (which is “five or less”), so they may conduct
Politics. The position of the Polarization marker on the track also
indicates the cost of this Politics Command: two Resources. The
Moderates pay the Resources and choose to place an available
white cube from the Senate forces box in the Political Display.

3.4 German Actions
German Action Phase

© 2020 GMT Games, LLC

In Phase II of the game only (2.4),
whenever an Event with German
Action Phase printed on it becomes
the current Event, before any Factions may conduct actions, the Senate player rolls 1d6. On 1 to 3, the
Germans take action first, before the
player Factions; otherwise they go
after the player Factions.
German actions are determined using the German actions flowchart
sheet provided.

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

4.2.2 Foreign Relations. Foreign
Relations can be used to adjust
friendly Vassalage (1.9). It may accompany any Command.

NOTE: The Senate player may use the Coordinate Special
Activity (4.2.4) to decide the details of the German actions.
EXAMPLE: The game is in Phase II and Event #26 Jaeger
Return To Finland is played. It has the German Action Phase
text at the top. Before any Factions take actions, the Senate
player rolls a 1d6. It is a “3”. The Germans are the first to act.
We now consult the German flowchart sheet to see what their
action will be.
PLAY NOTE: Use the three spots marked “Germany” in the
Eligibility track (2.2) for placement of the German cylinder
to mark whether they go before or after the player Factions, or
taking no action on this card.

PROCEDURE: Either increase friendly Vassalage by one or
conduct the Success Roll procedure below, and—if successful—decrease the friendly Vassalage by one.
SUCCESS ROLL: Decreasing friendly foreign Vassalage
depends on a Success Roll as follows:
1.	 Spend any number of Resources to set a Target Value
(initially zero). For each Resource spent, add +2 to the
Target Value.
2.	 Roll 1d6. If the roll is less than or equal to the Target Value,
the action succeeds. Otherwise, the action fails and has no
effect. The invested Resources are forfeited.

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General

When a Faction, per the Sequence of Play (2.0), is to execute a
Command in at least one space, it may also execute one of its
Special Activities (SA). EXCEPTION: Limited Command (3.1).
•	 As with Commands, the executing Faction selects spaces,
Factions, or pieces affected, as well as the order of actions.
•	 A Faction may execute its Special Activity at any one time
immediately before, during, or immediately after the
execution of its Operation.
4.1.1 Accompanying Commands. Some Special Activities
specify that they may only accompany certain Commands.
If not otherwise specified, Special Activities may accompany
any Command and take place in any otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 Reds and Senate Special Activities

4.2.1 Political Event. Political Event increases Faction Resources. It may accompany any Command.
PROCEDURE: Select up to four spaces with an Active friendly
Cell and friendly Control. For each selected space, add one
Resource.

DESIGN NOTE: Sabotage of bridges and railways was common during the war.
4.2.4 Coordinate (Senate only). Coordinate allows the Senate to decide all the details of the
next action of the German Power (3.4; see the
German actions flowchart sheet). It may be used
by the Senate only and accompany any Command in Phase II.
PROCEDURE: Place the Coordinate marker on the German
Eligibility cylinder.
4.2.5 Crackdown (Senate only). Crackdown neutralizes Opposition. It may be used by the Senate and may accompany any
Command in Phase II except Attack (3.2.4) and March (3.2.5).
PROCEDURE: In one space with Senate Control and an Active Senate Cell, place a white Terror marker there (maximum
two Terror markers, regardless of color, may coexist in a
space, 1.4.3). Shift Opposition one level towards Neutral and
increase Polarization by one for each Terror marker placed.
DESIGN NOTE: See Playbook Events Background entry for
#37 VATO.

4.3 Moderates’ Special Activities

4.3.1 Personality. The Personality Special Activity places the Personality marker on the map or,
in Phase II only (2.4), uses a News marker. It
may accompany either the Rally (3.3.1) or the
Politics Command (3.3.4).

PROCEDURE: First, in Phase II only, if desired, in the selected
space with the Personality and an Underground Moderates
Cell holding News (3.3.2), discard the News and place an
Available cube (of any color) in the Political Display (1.11).
Then, if News is discarded, conduct one of the following:
•	 add 1d6 of Resources or
•	 lower Polarization by 1d6 halved (round up).
Alternatively, in either Phase, in any one selected Town with a
Moderates Cell, place the Personality from Available in there.
DESIGN NOTE: One of the Moderates Personalities in the
game is the Social Democrat politician Väinö Tanner (18811966). Respected across the Finnish political spectrum, Tanner
served in formative political and societal roles over the course of
a political career spanning decades. During the Finnish Civil
War, despite his role in the Social Democratic Party, Tanner
did not join the Red Revolt; instead he participated in various
efforts to reach a political settlement to the crisis.
From amongst the bourgeoisie, such influential cultural figures
as the novelist Juhani Aho (1861-1921) and the politician
Uuno Hannula (1891-1963) can be thought of as Moderate
Personalities. (See the Playbook for a more detailed history.)

EXAMPLE: The Moderates have two Cells, a Network and
the Personality in Helsinki, as well as one Cell and a Network
in Tampere. The Moderates player conducts Publish, selecting
Tampere and Helsinki, earning in total two Resources for these
two Towns. Then the player activates two Cells in Helsinki (one
for the Network, the other for the Personality there) and one in
Tampere (for the Network there) earning a further six Resources
for total earnings of eight Resources.
DESIGN NOTE: The Publish Special Activity represents the
efforts by the Moderates Personalities (see above) to prepare
and publish various documents—from conciliatory newspaper
columns to truce proposals (see also Event #32 Armistice
Proposal).

5.0 EVENTS
Each Event card bears a title, Event year, flavor image with
caption, and an Event text. Flavor text and image are provided
for historical interest only and have no effect on play. Some
Event cards have a German Action Phase text indicating that
a foreign Power may be active on the card (3.4).

4.3.2 Dialogue. Dialogue shifts Support and Opposition, or
replaces an enemy Cell with a Moderates Cell. It may accompany any Command except Rally (3.3.1). Select any spaces
with Underground Moderates.
PROCEDURE: In one space with an Underground Moderates Cell, Activate the Moderates Cell. Then, in the selected
space, either
•	 shift Support or Opposition one level towards Neutral, or
•	 replace an Inactive enemy Cell with a Moderates Cell.
NOTE: Dialogue may never replace an enemy Cell such
that it would lead to the removal of a Capability or Prepared marker, or the transfer of News.
4.3.3 Publish. Publish increases Moderates Resources. It may
accompany any Command except Rally (3.3.1) and Negotiate
(3.3.3). Select up to two spaces with one or more Population
and any Moderates pieces.
PROCEDURE: For each selected Town, add one Resource.
Then in each selected space desired, Activate up to one
Underground Moderates Cell if the Personality is present
plus up to one Underground Moderates Cell if any Moderates Networks are present. Add two Resources for each Cell
Activated.

5.1 Executing Events

When a Faction executes an Event, it must carry out the Event
text literally (sometimes this may involve actions or decisions
by other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing
Faction makes all selections involved in implementing the
text, such as which pieces are affected or which Faction will
execute a Free Command (3.1.2). If another Faction is specified
or selected to take an action, that Faction decides the details
of their action; this does not affect Eligibility (2.2).

© 2020 GMT Games, LLC

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules
Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence. However:
•	 Events may not violate Stacking (1.4.3).
•	 Events place only Available pieces and markers, unless
otherwise specified (see EXCEPTION in 1.4.2).
•	 Events may not raise a Faction’s Resources beyond 30.
An executed Event’s text that can be implemented, must be. If
not all of its text can be carried out, implement that which can.

5.2 Dual Use

Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text.
The executing Faction may select either the unshaded or
shaded text to carry out (not both). The unshaded text helps
the Senate, while the shaded text often favors the Moderates
or the Reds.

5.3 Capabilities

Events marked Capability give corresponding markers to
the Faction executing the Event. EXCEPTION: The Moderates
cannot have Capability markers, but may execute such Events on
another Faction’s behalf.
When executing such an Event, place the corresponding
marker showing the appropriate side in the Capabilities
box. If the game is in Phase II (2.4), place the marker with a
friendly Cell anywhere on the map. Place Jaeger in Vaasa or
otherwise in the nearest space with a Senate Cell (see 2.4).
(See also 1.4.3 Stacking.)
IMPORTANT: Capabilities may not stand alone. They
are removed along with the removal of any last friendly
Cell in a space.

5.4 Free Commands

Some Events allow the executing—or another—Faction to
execute an immediate Command or Special Activity that
interrupts the usual sequence of play, and typically is free: it
bears no Resource cost to any Faction involved and does not
affect Eligibility (2.2), though other requirements remain—
unless overridden by the Event text (5.1).

6.0 PROPAGANDA ROUNDS
When a Propaganda card is turned up as the
upcoming Event, immediately stop play and swap
it with the current Event. Then conduct a Propaganda Round in the sequence of phases below.

6.1 Victory Phase

If any Faction has met its victory conditions (i.e., one or
more Factions have a positive victory margin), and no Power
friendly to a winning Faction prevents a win (7.2), the game
ends. See 7.0 Victory to determine winner and rank order.
Otherwise, continue with the Propaganda Round.

6.2 Politics Phase

Count the cubes currently in both Factions’ colors
in the Political Display (both colors, combined)
that are contributing towards Resolving an Unresolved Issue (1.11). Then roll 1d6. If the roll is
greater than the total number of cubes, there is no effect and
the Politics Phase is immediately concluded. If all Issues have
already been Resolved, also end the Politics Phase without
an effect.
If the die-roll is equal to or less than the number of cubes, the
Issue becomes Resolved:
•	 Count, then remove, all cubes from the Political Display,
and mark an Unresolved Issue as Resolved, using the
provided markers. Use the white side of the Resolved
marker if the Senate cubes are greater in number than the
Reds cubes, use the red side if Reds cubes outnumber the
Senate’s.
•	 In a tie, the Moderates decide the color of the Resolved
marker to award.
•	
Adjust the Networks+Issues marker on the
Polarization track (1.10) to indicate that an
Issue was Resolved.
The markers affect the cost of Reds and Senate Agitation as
detailed below.
6.2.1 Resolved Issues and Cost of Agitation. White Resolved Issue markers increase the Reds Agitation cost, and
conversely, red markers increase the Senate Agitation costs
by one Resource each. This increased cost applies in the first
selected Agitation space of each action only, whether during
a Propaganda Round (6.4) or during the Activism Command
(3.2.2). Increased costs are cumulative if multiple Resolved
markers of one color are in play.
EXAMPLE: Two white Resolved markers in the Political Display
means the cost of Agitation in the first selected Agitation space
during the Reds’ Activism Command has the following cost: one
Resource for selecting the space, plus one Resource to Agitate
one level there, plus two Resources for the two white Resolved
markers. Total cost is therefore four Resources.

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules

6.3 Resources Phase

Add to each Faction’s Resources—up to a maximum of 30
Resources each—as follows:
•	Senate: Add one for each level of Support (regardless of
Population).
•	Reds: Add Resources up to Reds Controlled Population.
•	Moderates: For every two levels of Polarization at five
or less, add one Resource, then, for each one level of
Polarization above five, add one Resource.
EXAMPLE: Vaasa, Mikkelin lääni (Population zero), and
Helsinki are all at Active Support. For these spaces, the Senate
earns six Resources in total.
EXAMPLE: Polarization is at seven. For this, the Moderates
earn two plus two Resources—two for the first five levels plus
one each for the sixth and the seventh level of Polarization, for
a total of four.

6.4 Support Phase

6.4.1 Russian Turmoil. Shift Russian Vassalage one level
toward zero. If the marker is already at zero, there is no effect.
DESIGN NOTE: The gradual erosion of Russian involvement
reflects the historical trajectory caused by the dual effects of
German geopolitical interference and Russia’s descent into
revolution and civil war.
6.4.2 Agitation. All Factions may shift Support and Opposition or decrease Polarization—or the Reds and Moderates
may place a Network or Administration. The Moderates only
place cubes in the Political Display.
During each Faction’s actions below, each Resource spent
replaces Cells with an Administration or a Network, places
a cube in the Political Display or removes a Terror marker
and—once no Terror is left in the space—either decreases
Polarization one level or shifts Support or Opposition in the
space. Note also the potential effect of Resolved Issues on the
cost of Reds and Senate Agitation (6.2.1).
•	Senate. First, in spaces that the Senate Controls and in
which they have an Active Cell, they may do one of the
following:
◦	 Agitate to shift Support or Opposition up to any levels
desired; or
◦	 decrease Polarization up to the number of eligible
spaces, but first paying to remove all Terror, if any.
•	Reds. Then, in each space that the Reds Control, and in
which they have an Active Cell or Administration, they
may do one of the following:
◦	 In one space, replace two Reds Cells with an
Administration; or
◦	 Agitate to shift Support or Opposition up to any levels
desired if there is a Reds Administration in the space,
otherwise up to Passive Opposition only; or
◦	 decrease Polarization by one, but first paying to remove
all Terror, if any.

•	Moderates. Next, in each Uncontrolled space with
a Moderates piece and one or more Population, the
Moderates may do one of the following:
◦	 Replace two Moderates Cells with a Network; or
◦	 Agitate to shift Support or Opposition up to any levels
desired toward Neutral (ignoring any Terror); or
◦	 decrease Polarization by one (ignoring any Terror); or
◦	 place one cube (of any color) in the Political Display.
6.4.3 Game End? If this is the final Propaganda Round, the
game ends. See 7.0 Victory to determine winner. Otherwise
continue to the next Reset Phase.

6.5 Reset Phase

Prepare for the next Campaign as detailed in the sections
below.
6.5.1 Prisoners of War. In Phase II of the game only, conduct
the following steps:
•	 First the Reds, then the Senate may release any number
of enemy Prisoners, placing them back into the enemy’s
Available box. Then, for every two Cells (of any color,
combined) remaining in the Prisoners box, increase
Polarization by one.
DESIGN NOTE: Historically, the treatment of the prisoners
of war by both sides was brutal and constitutes, to this day,
one of the most painful legacies of the conflict. Extrajudicial
executions, starvation, and other maltreatment of captured
enemies in battle and the prisoner camps were a regular feature
during and after the Finnish Civil War. It has been estimated
that nearly half of the civil war’s deaths occurred in captivity.
6.5.2 Pivotal Event. If this is the second Propaganda card
and if the #24 Red Revolt! Pivotal Event (2.4) has not yet
occurred, replace the next Event card with the Red Revolt!
Pivotal Event.
6.5.3 Powers. If the game is in Phase II, place or remove
Powers’ Troops such that their number equals that of the
respective Vassalage marker as follows.
•	Place: Germans from Out of Play into the Power’s
Available Forces box and Russians from Out of Play to
one random Town with Reds pieces (otherwise nowhere).
•	Remove: Remove random Troops from the map to Out of
Play.
6.5.4 Old News. Remove all Terror, Sabotage, and News
markers (including those held by Cells) on the map.
6.5.5 Senate Conscription. If this is the first Propaganda
Round (6.0), place the ten Senate Cells from Out of Play into
the Senate Available Forces box.
Finally, play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the
draw deck’s new top card. Continue play.
IMPORTANT: Do not adjust the Eligibility order. Play
continues using the Eligibility order based upon the actions
on the previous Event card (2.0).

7.0 VICTORY
This had not been victory, but defeat—of everyone, of
the whole of Finland. Victory in a war between brothers
is not a victory for which the winner may crown itself.
~ Juhani Aho (1918), novelist

Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below
and on the Faction aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

Whenever a Faction passes a victory check (6.1)—or if none
does by game end—the Faction that reached the highest victory margin (7.3) comes in first place, second-highest comes
in second place, and so on.
Ties go to Non-players, then the Moderates, then the Senate.

7.2 Victory During a Propaganda Round

Check Victory at the start of each Propaganda Round (6.0),
comparing the positions of the various Victory markers to
the thresholds marked on the edge track.
Victory conditions are:
•	Reds: Total Opposition plus Reds Administrations on the
map exceeds 11 and Russian Vassalage plus Polarization
is five or less.
•	Senate: Total Senate Controlled Town Population exceeds
three and German Vassalage plus Polarization is less than
six.
•	Moderates: Moderates Resources exceed 14 and Resolved
Issues plus Networks plus one is equal to or greater than
Polarization.
NOTE: Russia or Germany win (at 6.4.3 of the last Propaganda Round only) if no Faction’s victory margin is
positive (7.3).

19

•	 Russia and/or Germany set the Reds and/or Senate
Victory margin to zero if friendly Vassalage plus
Polarization exceeds five, and win themselves (at 6.4.3 of
the last Propaganda Round only) if no Faction’s victory
margin is positive. The higher Vassalage Power wins, or
if a tie, nobody wins.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction
has reached its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
DESIGN NOTE: Victory conditions and related game dynamics are based on the following thematic concepts of Victory:
Reds: The Red Revolt succeeds and Finland joins the front
of Socialist countries, led by fellow ideologists in Russia.
Independence remains a dream as Finland follows the Soviet
Union into decades of conflict with the West.
Senate: With a significant level of reliance on Germany as
an ally and as a guarantor of safety against Russia, a liberalmonarchist Senate and an invited king from Germany take
power in a semi-independent Finland. As industrialization
and its extremes gather speed, the rulers suppress recurring
waves of working class agitation.
Moderates: Reconciliation politics win the day as social democratic Finland addresses many of the demands of the working
class while continuing on as a capitalist country. In foreign
policy, independent Finland sets off on a neverending, narrow
and winding path between the West and the East.
Russia or Germany: Finnish independence is lost as an external power occupies the country, subjecting the Senate and the
parliament to a foreign will. For the foreseeable future, Finland
becomes a vassal state.
STOP!
You have read all rules needed for three players.

7.3 Victory After the Final Propaganda Round

If the Final Propaganda Round (2.3.1) is complete without a
victory check win (6.1), the Faction with the highest victory
margin—or a Power—wins.
•	Reds: Opposition plus Reds Administrations minus 11.
NOTE: Russian Vassalage plus Polarization exceeding
five sets the Reds Victory margin to zero.

	
•	Senate: Senate Controlled Town Population minus 3.

NOTE: German Vassalage plus Polarization exceeding
five sets the Senate Victory margin to zero.

	
•	Moderates: Moderates Resources minus 14, then minus
one for each level of Networks + Issues below four.

8.0 NON-PLAYERS
This section governs actions taken by any Factions beyond
those represented by a player—for solitaire play or games
with only two players. See also the Playbook’s Non-player
Examples of Play (page 21 forward).
The solitaire system in All Bridges Burning differs from those
in most of the previously published COIN Series games
in that it is based upon special Non-player mini-decks of
cards. When it is a Non-player Faction’s turn to play, follow
the procedure detailed in 8.1 Non-player Sequence of Play
below. This sequence specifies how a Non-player conducts
actions, whether based upon drawing a Non-player card, or
some other procedure.
IMPORTANT: If playing solitaire, be sure to read the
special one-player victory conditions (8.7) before you start!
NOTE: Non-player Factions may not necessarily act only
in their own direct interest. Like players, they sometimes
help, sometimes harm, one another.

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

In games with Non-player Factions, set up as normal (2.1)
and play the game following the base game rules, except as
detailed in the sections below.
8.1.1 Non-player Decks. Create the initial Non-player card
mini-decks (8.2)—for each Non-player Faction, respectively—
and set them aside within easy reach.
PLAY NOTE: If you prefer, you may leave out the Non-player
cards that are specific to a particular Phase (I or II, 2.4) when
you are not playing the Phase to which they belong (see the
green Condition Box on each card, 8.2.1).
8.1.2 No Non-player Resource Tracking. Non-player Factions
do not track nor spend Resources when conducting actions.
•	 Non-player Reds and Senate Resources cylinders are not
used in solitaire play.
•	 Place the Non-player Moderates Resources cylinder in
the 0 space of the edge track for the purpose of tracking
Non-player Moderates Victory only.
•	 If Non-player Moderates Pass (2.2.2), add one Moderates
Resource.
•	 Whenever Events or actions require a Non-player to
transfer or reduce its Resources, this does not apply to
the Non-player Reds and Senate. Transfer and adjust the
Moderates Resources cylinder as in the base game (e.g.,
if Terror removes the Personality, 3.2.3).

8.1.3 Non-player Rules Exceptions. The Non-player Factions
obey all base game rules, with the following exceptions:
•	 No Resource spending (8.1.2).
•	 Non-players are always considered to have automatically
spent the necessary Resources for Offsetting the effects
of Terror and Support or Opposition in a space during a
Rally (3.2.1, 3.3.1).
•	 Non-players are always considered to have automatically
spent the necessary Resources for paying to Remove Terror
during Agitation (3.2.2, 6.4.2).
•	 The Senate Attack Strength (3.2.4) is initially seven, and
the Reds five; add or subtract any modifiers to this number
(such as from a Defending Prepared marker, 3.2.4).
•	 The Reds and Senate Activism Command (3.2.2) use a
special die-roll procedure when Activating friendly Cells
(details in 8.3.2 and 8.4.3).
8.1.4 Sequence of Play Options. When given a choice per the
Sequence of Play (2.0), the Non-players select from available
action options (recording steps using the Eligibility cylinders,
2.2) in this order and then execute one as follows:
1.	 NP to Play. If there is the “NP to play” marker on the
current card, the Non-player Faction will play the Event.
Then remove the marker.
2.	
Pass to play next Event. If the next Event has
the Pass symbol for this Faction ( , , ), the
Non-player will Pass to play the next Event.
•	 As a reminder, mark the next Event using
the “NP to play” marker.
3.	 Reds & Senate Capabilities. Whenever it is the Nonplayer Senate or Reds turn to play and a Capability Event
(5.3) is the current or next Event, go through the following
procedure:
•	 If the Capability card is a Trains Event (#15 or #17),
Senate always plays the Event or Pass now to play it
as the next card.
•	 Otherwise, roll 1d6:
◦	 If the die roll value is less than or equal to two times
the number of Capabilities the Non-player already
possesses (for the Reds, modify by +2), the Faction
will not play the Event, otherwise they play it as
follows:
▪	 If the current Event is a Capability, play it.
▪	 If the next Event is a Capability and only if no other
Faction has already Passed this card, Pass and play
the Capability Event next turn. As a reminder,
mark the next Event using the “NP to play”
marker.

© 2020 GMT Games, LLC

All Bridges Burning ~ Rules
4.	Event. Execute the current Event only if the card is marked
by a colored symbol ( , , ) of the active Non-player
Faction.
◦	 Event Instructions. A symbol with the letter “i” inside
( , , ) indicates that there are special Event
instructions for the indicated Faction. See the Nonplayer aid sheet for the Event instructions.
◦	 In the absence of instructions, use the general priorities
(8.1.7) if and when applicable. Choose from among any
remaining options randomly (8.6).
5.	 Cmd+SA or Lim Cmd: Draw a random Non-player card
(see 8.2), then choose per below:
1.	Cmd+SA. Only if the Non-player Faction is playing as
the last Eligible Faction on the current card, conduct a
full Command and a Special Activity per the card’s
instructions.
2.	 Lim Cmd. Otherwise, conduct a Limited Command
(only) in the first executable space, as determined per
the card’s instructions.
◦	 News. If a Non-player Faction that just executed
a Limited Command (only) holds a News marker,
immediately spend the News to execute an additional
Limited Command (3.3.2). Select the Command by
reconstituting the Non-player deck (see 9., below),
then draw from it.
6.	Event. Occasionally the active Non-player Faction may
(per the Sequence of Play, 2.2) be left with the Event
option only. In that case, play the Event using the priorities
detailed in 8.1.6 and 8.1.7.
7.	Pass. Non-players Pass as the last option if no other action
is possible (8.2.1).
8.	 Record Steps. As in the base game, record the steps as
they were taken by the Factions in the Sequence of Play
track (2.2.3).
9.	 Reconstitute the Non-player Deck. After executing all
Non-player actions, return all drawn Non-player cards
to that Faction’s Non-player deck, shuffle, and place the
deck back on the table within easy reach.
8.1.5 Ineffective Events. Regardless of the above, Non-player
Factions opt only for Events that have an actual effect (something happens, including Capabilities, 5.3).
EXAMPLE: The current Event is #18 Mobilization in the Periphery, which allows the Non-player Moderates to trigger the
Politics Phase of the Propaganda Round (6.2). However, there
are no cubes in the Political Display and thus triggering the
Politics Phase would result in no effect. Therefore, the Event is
ineffective and not played by the Non-player Moderates this time.

21

8.1.6 Free Non-player Actions. When a Faction plays an
Event that gives free Commands or Special Activities (3.1.2)
to another Non-player Faction, or forces it to make other
choices, make use of the following priorities:
•	 Consult instructions for the Event card as detailed in the
Event Instructions sheet provided, if any.
•	 In case of particular, named, free Commands and Special
Activities, find the Non-player card with instructions for
that free Command or Special Activity and apply them in
order to execute the action.
•	 Otherwise, draw a Non-player card and execute first
executable Command or Special Activity as the free action
(subject to regular Non-player procedures; e.g., regarding
the Condition Box, 8.2.1).
•	 Otherwise and within the above, select from among any
remaining options randomly (8.6).
8.1.7 Pieces, Resources, Support, and Opposition. Where
applicable and not otherwise instructed (e.g., in the Event
or action instructions), Non-players place pieces and adjust
Support or Opposition following these priorities to the maximum extent possible:
•	Stacking. Non-players never place more than one Reds
Administration, Moderates Network, or friendly Prepared
marker in a single space, respectively.
•	 Removal and Replacement. Remove enemy’s Active
Senate, Reds Cells, and any Inactive Moderates Cells, if
able. Senate and Reds prefer to replace friendly Inactive
Cells, while Moderates prefer friendly Active Cells, if able.
•	Support/Opposition. Senate seeks to increase Support
first, then reduce Opposition; Reds increase Opposition
first, then seek to reduce Support; and the Moderates
always seek to increase Neutral Population. Within these
guidelines, prioritize Towns over Provinces.
•	Control. Senate seeks to add Senate Control first, then to
remove Reds Control; Reds to increase Reds Control and
then to reduce Senate Control; and the Moderates seek to
increase Uncontrolled Population.
•	Resources. Never voluntarily transfer Resources (1.5).
•	Attacks. Non-players always Engage—rather than allow
the enemy a Retreat option (3.2.4).
8.1.8 Propaganda Rounds. Conduct a Propaganda Round as
normal (6.0). For Non-player decisions, consult the procedures listed in the Solitaire play-aid sheet provided.
8.1.9 Capabilities. For placing Capabilities, consult the priorities listed in the Solitaire play-aid sheet provided.

8.2 Non-player Cards

There are three separate Non-player card mini-decks, one
for each Faction. Each mini-deck consists of five or six cards,
depending on the Faction.
•	 The sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 below contain more detailed
versions of the instructions printed on the Non-player
cards. It is not necessary to read through those lengthy
sections before playing; the priorities are summarized on
the Non-player cards. Refer to these rules as needed to
clarify the cards’ shorthand.
TERMS: For the sake of brevity, the Non-player cards use a
number of shorthands and other technical terms:
•	 Highest/lowest/most = in an ascending /
descending order
•	 Mods = the Moderates
•	 n+ = As many as n or more
•	 Opp = Opposition
•	 Pop = Population
•	 Sup = Support
•	 w/o = without
•	 ≈ = Closest to or as close as possible
•	
= 1d6 rolls “1”
•	 ± = Plus or minus
The Key Terms Index in this Rules of Play booklet contains
further helpful clarifications of key concepts.

8.2.2 Instructions. Each card contains instructions for one
Command and an associated Special Activity or Activities.
The cards are referred to by the Command name the card
details for a given Faction (e.g., the “Senate March card”).
8.2.3 Executing Card Instructions. The following rules govern
the execution of the Non-player cards’ instructions.
•	Commands. If the Command listed on a Non-player card
cannot be executed (not even partially), discard and draw
a new Non-player card. Repeat until a Command that can
be executed, even if only partially, is found.
•	 Special Activities. If a card’s Command—but not its
Special Activity—can be executed do not draw a new card.
In this case, the Non-player conducts no Special Activity.
Record steps accordingly as applicable (2.2).
•	 Top to Bottom. Execute the card’s instructions from
top to bottom. Some cards list multiple Commands and
Special Activities, in which case, conduct the first possible
option from the top. As instructed in 8.1 Sequence of Play,
sometimes Non-players execute a Limited Command only.
•	 Available Forces. The Non-players never make use
of the option to place forces from the map (see 1.4.2).
EXCEPTION: Non-player Reds may use Rally to place
Administrations from the map (see 8.3.1 below).
8.2.4 Record Steps. Use the Non-player Faction’s cylinder to
mark a move on the Sequence of Play track as it was actually taken.
NOTE: Occasionally, the instructions of a Non-player card
may lead the Non-player to execute a Limited Command
only, even while 8.1.4 Sequence of Play Options indicate a
full Command with a Special Activity.

8.2.5 Reading the Cards. The Non-player cards show priorities with circled numbers (e.g., , and , ) and letters
( , ) to indicate their order and nature:
•	 Numbered priorities ( , ) are sequential priorities.
Execute the instructions in each sequential priority to the
maximum extent possible before moving on to the next
sequential priority. Some top-level sequential priorities
(black circles; , ) contain further subsequent priorities
(white circles; e.g., , ) that are parts and sequential
steps of that top-level priority, respectively.
•	 Lettered priorities ( , ) are nested priorities. Nested
priorities act as tie breakers within the sequential priorities
to which they are ordained. Each nested priority further
narrows the thus-far selected set of spaces or targets. For
readability, nested priorities have a shaded background
in one of the Faction colors.

8.2.1 Condition Box. If the condition at the top of the card is
printed on a green background is answered in the affirmative, execute the card’s instructions; if not, discard and keep
drawing a new Non-player card until you find a condition
that is met. If no condition is met, the Non-player chooses
the Pass option.

8.3 Non-player Reds Actions

8.3.2 Reds Activism (Card #49).

8.3.1 Reds Rally (Card #48).

Condition: If there are any Reds Cells or Administrations
Available, or if any Reds Administrations exist in spaces with
Active Opposition, Rally as follows.
Preliminaries: Within the priorities below, the Non-player Reds
will Rally in up to three spaces. Whenever the priorities below
instruct so, place Administrations first from the Reds Available box, otherwise relocate an Administration (e.g., place to
Available then onto the map, 1.4.2) from an Active Opposition
space, but only such that no Reds Control is thereby lost.
Place Cells in each space with a Reds Administration, but
with no Reds Cells present.
If an Administration is Available, or there is an Administration in an Active Opposition space (for the purposes of
relocating the piece), Rally replacing two Reds Cells with an
Administration in one space with one or more Population,
no Active Opposition yet (and room for an Administration,
1.4.3), and either
•	 two or more Reds Cells and no Senate Cells there; or
•	 three or more Reds and any Senate Cells there.
Rally placing Cells:
•	
to Control one space with one or more Population.
Within that, prioritize spaces with an Administration
and no Active Opposition yet.
•	
•	

23

In one space with Reds already.
Finally, if the Rally space-limit set in the Preliminaries
(three spaces) has not yet been reached, Rally in random
(8.6) spaces with one or more Population until the limit is
reached.

PREPARE.

Preliminaries: Within priority # below, place only up to as
many Sabotage markers as there are Senate Train markers on
the map.
First, place an Available Sabotage marker at a border closest to a Train Capability marker of the Senate player (thus
ignoring Non-player Senate’s Trains). Within that priority,
if choice, select a Town border.
Place an Available Prepared marker in a Town (with Reds
Cells, 4.2.3). Within that, prioritize Towns that are closest
to Helsinki, including Helsinki itself.
PLAY NOTE: Occasionally, the Non-player Reds may end
up conducting no Special Activity while still Rallying in
multiple spaces, especially when there are no more Prepared
markers Available, or when already as many Sabotage markers
as Senate Train markers exist on the map. Nonetheless, if (and
only if) the Reds Rallied in more than one space above, place
the Reds Eligibility cylinder in the appropriate “Cmd (may
add Special Activity)” box.

Condition: If the game is in Phase I and a 1d6 rolls more than
the number of Active Reds Cells already on the map—and
there are no spaces with a Reds Administration and no Reds
Cells on the map—conduct Activism as follows.
PLAY NOTE: Retain the above rolled die and its value for
possible use in the priority # below.
If this is a Limited Command, ignore this action point entirely. Otherwise, flip Senate Cells to Inactive and Moderates
to Active if and as able. Within that, prioritize the flipping of
a player’s Cells, then, or within that, spaces where the
last Active Senate Cell of the space can be flipped to Inactive.
Activate Reds Cells up to the value of the die rolled above
in the Condition section of this Command. Within that priority, Activate in spaces with only one Reds Cell, then or
within that, Activate last in spaces with Active Opposition.

FOREIGN RELATIONS.

Condition: Consider executing this Special Activity only if
the game is in Phase I and Russian Vassalage is exactly “2”.
If a 1d6 rolls 1 or 2, increase Russian Vassalage by one.
PREPARE per 8.3.1 above.

8.3.3 Reds Activism (Card #50).

Condition: If the game is in Phase II and there are no spaces
with a Reds Administration and no Reds Cells present on the
map, conduct Activism as follows.
If the game is in the last Campaign—and Oppose+Admins
is 12 or more and Polarization is 7 or less—remove Active
Reds Cells such as to bring the difference between Polarization and Russian Vassalage as close to 5 as possible. Do not
remove Active Reds where doing so would cause Senate to
take Control of a space with Opposition.
If this is a Limited Command, ignore this action point entirely. Otherwise, flip Senate Cells to Inactive and Moderates
to Active, if and as able. Within that, prioritize the flipping
of player’s Cells, then, or within that, spaces where the
last Active Senate Cell of the space can be flipped to Inactive.
Agitate in one space with an Administration (and Reds
Control, 3.2.2). Within that, prioritize Town spaces, then
or within that, where there is least Opposition.
If a 1d6 rolls more than the number of Active Reds Cells
already on the map, Activate the rolled number of Reds.
Within that, Active last in spaces with Opposition.
If no Activism has yet occurred during the priorities above,
attempt to conduct priority # again, but this time regardless
of which Campaign it is (still observe the other conditions).
PREPARE per 8.3.1 above.

SETUP
General:

Give each player a Faction foldout and assign each a Faction.
One or more Factions may be designated as a Non-players
(8.0).

Deck Preparation:

Separate out the four Propaganda cards and then separately
shuffle the twenty-one Event cards marked “1917,” and the
twenty-one Event cards marked “1918”. Keep all Event cards
face down throughout. Each Campaign Deck will consist of
nine Event cards plus a Propaganda card, as follows:
1917 Campaign Deck. Combine four 1917 Event cards and
one Propaganda card, then shuffle. The Propaganda cards
are numbered from the first to fourth Propaganda Round
for a thematic effect only and may be used interchangeably.
Next, add five more 1917 Event cards to the top of that pile
(do not shuffle).
1918 Campaign Deck. Follow the same procedure as above
using the 1918 Event cards.
After setting up the decks, there will be three leftover Event
cards each for 1917 and 1918, respectively. These cards may
not be inspected.
Draw Deck. To form the draw deck for a game of All Bridges
Burning, stack two 1917 Campaign Decks, then, below them,
two 1918 Campaign Decks.

						               													<description>The year is 1917. Russia&amp;rsquo;s Tsar Nicholas II has abdicated and Russia slides toward an ever deepening internal crisis. On the western edge of the vast Russian Empire, the uncertainty in Russia is giving rise to a power vacuum in the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. For many across the Finnish political spectrum, the turmoil in Russia looks like an opportunity to fulfill the dream of Finnish national independence. Yet the competing factions are unable to agree on a common political vision for the country. By January 1918, a bloody civil war will have broken out in Finland.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Bridges Burning recreates the political and military affairs of the Finnish civil war in a new COIN System volume for three players. The Reds seek to stage a working class revolt and then hold onto their gains, while the White Senate forces seek to reassert control. A third, non-violent Social Democratic faction fights for the survival of moderate leftism and political reform. All three factions must keep the national sentiment conciliatory enough for a post-conflict settlement and national independence. In addition, the non-player powers of Germany and Russia offer military assistance to the Senate and the Reds, respectively. Excessive foreign involvement, however, could quash the dream of Finnish independence and prompt a collective loss of all three player factions. Historical events, asymmetrical action menus, as well as extensive historical design notes familiarize the players with the historical period.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A unique sequence of play for three factions poses players &amp;ndash; whether veteran or new to the COIN Series &amp;ndash; fresh challenges in selecting from the asymmetric commands and special activities. The Reds will find themselves needing to split time and resources between competing tasks of solidifying the Red revolt by creating working organs of civilian administration on the one hand, and fighting an increasingly desperate war against a far more powerful enemy on the other. The White Senate faction, in contrast, has a more traditional war to fight. The Senate will want to enhance their military performance by capabilities such as armored trains, cannons, as well as the Finnish, German-trained 27th Jaeger Battalion. Meanwhile the Social Democrats will be focused on building and maintaining underground networks of information, distributing news across the fronts, and advancing a stagnating political process while fending off retributions from the two warring factions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A simple but effective card-driven non-player system enables the game to be played solitaire as well as in a two-player mode. The structure of the sequence of play, the character of the commands and special activities in the game, the smaller number of players, and compact size combine to enable All Bridges Burning to play fast. The solitaire system has been designed to preserve that speed and fluidity of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
