You can build onto a level

(See diagram to the left).
A tower with 3 blocks and

“Complete Tower”.

God Powers are cards that provide you with a
powerful ability A that can be used throughout
the game. Many God Powers change the way
Workers move and build.

God Of Music

You must obey

Your Move: Your Worker may
move into an opponent Worker’s
space by forcing their Worker to
the space yours just vacated.

all God Power text that
says you “cannot” or “must”, otherwise you lose
the game.
If the God
Power description states it affects blocks, it
does not affect domes.

2. Artemis

“Forced” is not “moved”.

The Challenger (determined by who is
the most “god-like”) chooses God
Powers equal to the number of players.
If playing a 3-player (
) or 4-player
(
) game, ensure all chosen God
Powers are compatible with the number
of players B . All God Powers are
playable in 2-Player games.
The Challenger reads each selected God
Power aloud from the rule book. Refer to
the set icon and index number C to
find each God Power description.
In clockwise order, everyone chooses a
God Power and places it in their area.
The Challenger receives the last God
Power.

Some God
Powers may cause Workers to be “forced” into
another space. A Worker that is forced, is not
considered to have moved.

Goddess of the Hunt

Your Move: Your Worker may
move one additional time, but not
back to its initial space.

Remember: to win the game by moving onto
the third level, your Worker must move up
during your turn. Therefore, if your Worker
is Forced onto the third level, you do not win
the game. Moving from one third level space to
another also does not trigger a win.

3. Athena
Goddess of Wisdom

God Powers apply

Opponent’s Turn: If one of your
Workers moved up on your last
turn, opponent Workers cannot
move up this turn.

specific time, according to what is stated at the
start in the God Power’s description.

4. Atlas

When using a God Power, all text in its

the player possessing the God Power. Any time
an “opponent” is mentioned in a God Power
description, it is referring an opponent of the
player possessing the God Power.

Titan Shouldering the Heavens

Your Build: Your Worker may
build a dome at any level.

5. Demeter

Additional Setup

D

must be performed
when using some God Powers. If your selected
God Power features “Setup” text in the
description, execute these special instructions
during the game Setup. If the order players
perform additional setup gives either player an
advantage, execute them in turn order.

Goddess of the Harvest

Your Build: Your Worker may
build one additional time, but not
on the same space.

Additional Win Conditions

are
specified by some God Powers. In addition to
being able to win by moving up onto the third
level during your turn, you can also win by
fulfilling the “Win Condition” described.
Many God Powers feature a icon D
to indicate it can be used in Golden Fleece
variant (Golden Fleece Expansion sold
separately). For more information, see the
Golden Fleece section of the rule book.

A

Your Build: Your Worker may
build one additional block (not
dome) on top of your first block.

7. Hermes
God of Travel

Your Turn: If your Workers do
not move up or down, they may
each move any number of times
(even zero), and then either builds.

8. Minotaur
Bull-headed Monster

For example, Apollo’s God Power description
starts with “Your Move”. This means if you
possess Apollo’s God Power, it can only be used
by you during the “move” phase of your turn.

The Challenger chooses a Start Player,
who places 2 Workers of their chosen
color on any unoccupied spaces on the
board. In clockwise order, the other
players each place all their Workers.

Using Hero Powers

51. Jason
Leader of the Argonauts

A Hero Power is an ability that you may perform
only once per game. Only you may use this power,
and no opponent’s power can make you use it.

46. Achilles

A Hero Power cannot be used in the Golden
Fleece variant. Hero Powers are only supported
in a 2-player game. Hero Powers are easily
identified by the purple back A and Helmet
icon B on in the border.

builds both before and after
moving.

47. Adonis

52. Medea

Use the “God Power Setup” instructions.

Devastatingly Handsome

Powerful Sorceress

End of Y​our ​Turn: Once, choose
an opponent Worker. If possible,
that Worker must be neighboring
one of your Workers at the end of their next turn.

between players of unequal skill, whereby more
experienced players are encouraged to select a
Hero Power for themselves and a God Power for
their opponent.

48. Atalanta
Swift Huntress

Your Move: Once, your Worker
moves any number of additional
times.

Fleece icon in the top right, and
place it beside the board (Players

The oldest player starts by placing two
Workers of their chosen color into any
unoccupied spaces on the board. The other
player then places their Workers.

5

The player who placed Workers first, places
the Ram figure on any unoccupied space.
The other player takes the first turn.

Your Turn: Once, instead of your normal turn,
place your extra Worker on an unoccupied
ground-level perimeter space. This Worker then
builds.

Setup
Hero Powers are often weaker than God Powers.
For a balanced game, we recommend only playing
Hero Powers against other Hero Powers.

Golden Fleece Variant

Setup: Take one extra Worker of
your color. This is kept on your
God Power card until needed.

End of Your Turn: Once, remove
one block from under any
number of Workers neighboring
your unmoved Worker. You also remove any
Tokens on the blocks.

Cunning Leader

Start of Your Turn: Once, force
to unoccupied corner spaces any
number of opponent Workers
that neighbor your Workers.

Glossary

Santorini is best as a 2-player game. However, we
have included rules for 3 and 4-players for those times
when you really want to play with more people.

Block: A part of a tower and forms a space on the board.

When playing with 3 or 4 players, all of the 2-player
rules apply, with the following adjustments:

Setup

When you build, place blocks from largest to smallest so
that they stack. For reference, see the “Complete Tower”
diagram on the front page.

Complete Tower: Consists of exactly three blocks and a
dome.

For 3 and 4-player games, you must play with God
Powers. When selecting which God Powers to play
with, they must all feature a
icon when playing a
3-player game, or a
icon in a 4-player game.

Dome: The top level on a Tower. Domes cannot have

3 Players

Neighboring: Each space has up to eight spaces
surrounding it. These are called its neighboring spaces.

anything placed upon them. A dome may onlt be built on
top of the third level, unless otherwised specified by a God
or Hero Power.

If you lose in a 3-player game, immediately remove
your Workers, Tokens, and God Power from the
game. If only one player remains, they are the winner.

Workers. Your team’s second player takes the first turn.
If any player wins, their team wins. If any player loses,
their team loses.

Occupied Space: A space containing a Worker or

the board.

Token: A marker specific to a God or Hero Power. You

your turn.

Unoccupied Space: A space not containing a Worker or
dome.

						               													<description>Santorini is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Move - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved.  When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning the game - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Variable player powers - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
