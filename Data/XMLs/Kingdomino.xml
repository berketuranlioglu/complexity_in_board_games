				<rulebook>RULES FOR KINGDOMINO
INTRODUCTION
You are a Lord seeking new lands to expand
your Kingdom. You must explore all the lands,
wheat fields, lakes, mountains in order to spot
the best plots. But be careful, as some otherLords are also coveting theses lands…
Note: Before your first game, assemble the 4
small castles.
OBJECT OF THE GAME
Connect your dominoes in order to build your
kingdom in a 5x5 grid in a way to score the most
prestige points.
SETUP
Place the box as indicated to the right.
Each player takes:
2-player games: two kings of their color.
3- and 4-player games: one king of their color.
Each player takes a starting tile (a square) and the
castle of their color. They place the tile, face up,
in front of them and then they place the castle
on it.
All the dominoes are thoroughly shuffled,
numbered side up, and then they are randomly
placed in the box insert to form the draw pile of
the game:
2 player games: first, remove 24 dominoes randomly, set them aside. Use the remaining 24.
3 player games: remove 12 dominoes randomly.
Play with remaining 36.
4 player games: use all 48 dominoes.

A Then, from the draw pile, take the same
number of dominoes as the number of kings in
play (i.e. three dominoes for a 3-player game and
four dominoes for a 2- or 4-player game). Display
them next to the box, numbered side up. These
dominoes must be displayed in the ascending
order (the lowest number next is always placed
next to the box). Finally, turn them on the landscape side.
B A player takes all the kings in their hands,
shuffle them thoroughly and then they get them
out of their hands one after the other. When your
king appears, place-it on an empty domino in the
line. Each tile can only have one king. It means
that the last player doesn’t have any choice. (In a
2-player game, each player will choose 2 dominoes, one for each of their kings).
C When all the dominoes have been chosen,
form a new line, as you previously did, by drawing new tiles.
PLAYING THE GAME
The playing order is determined by the positions
of the kings on the dominoes line.
The player, whose king, is placed on the 1st
domino of the line (the closest to the box) starts.
He must take the following actions:
D 1: Add the chosen domino to their territory
according the connection rules.
D 2: Choose a new domino in the new line by
placing their king on it. Then, it is the turn of the
player whose king is on the second domino to
take their two actions, and so on, until the last

player has taken their two actions. In a 2-player
game, each player will take the D 1 and D 2 actions
twice, once for each of their kings. Then, form a
new dominoes line and a new turn can start.
The game is played in 12 turns in 3- or 4-player
games, and only 6 turns in 2-player games (as
each player plays twice each turn).
Connection rules:
The players must build a kingdom in a 5x5 grid
(each domino is composed of two squares). In order to place down their domino, the player must:
- Either connect it to their starting tile (the starting domino can be considered as a wild domino,
any landscape can be connected to this domino),
- Or connect it to another domino matching at
least 1 of its landscape (horizontally or vertically
only).
If you can’t add a domino to your kingdom following these rules, the domino must be discarded and you will not get points for it.
All your dominoes must fit in 5x5 grid. If, due
to bad planning, one or more of your dominoes
could not fit, they are discarded. You will not get
points for them.
END OF THE GAME
When the last dominoes are lined up, the players
will take a last turn but they will only take the 1
action. Each player should have in front of them
a 5x5 grid forming their kingdom. (Some kingdoms may not be complete if a player was forced
to discard any dominoes – see above).
Then, each player will calculate their prestige
points for their kingdoms in the following way:
- A kingdom is composed of different PROPERTIES (groups of connected, either horizontally or
vertically, squares of the same type of landscape).
- Each property will give you as much prestige
points as the NUMBER OF SQUARES multiplied
with the NUMBER OF SPECIFIC CROWNS (see
back of rules) appearing on the property.
- You can have multiple properties with the same
type of landscape in the same kingdom.
- A property without a specific crowns will give
you no points.
- Each player will add the points given by all their

properties, the result is their final score.
The player with the highest score is the winner.
In case of a tie, the player with the most extended property (whether he owns any crowns or
not) wins the game.
If it is still a tie, the player who has the most
crowns wins the game. If there is still a tie anyway, the players share the victory.
ADDITIONAL RULES
Dynasty: Play 3 rounds in a row. At the end of
the 3 rounds, the player with the highest number
of points wins the game.
The middle Kingdom: score 10 additional points
if your castle is in the center of your kingdom.
Harmony: score 5 additional points if you territory is complete (no discarded dominoes).
The Mighty Duel: With 2 players. After one or
two practice games, the real champions battle to
build the largest kingdoms: use ALL the dominoes to build a 7x7 grid (a pen and paper might
be useful to keep your final score). You can mix
these different variants if you want according to
what you prefer.

						               													<description>In Kingdomino, you are a lord seeking new lands in which to expand your kingdom. You must explore all the lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains, in order to spot the best plots, while competing with other lords to acquire them first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses tiles with two sections, similar to Dominoes. Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round. The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown symbols.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
