your cards to win the jousting competitions, or fight with your sword, axe or morningstar.
Rally your squires, gain the support of a maiden, and surprise your opponents. The first
player to win four or five different tournaments becomes the overall victor.
Players
Playing Time
Components

Two to five
20 to 60 minutes (increasing with the number of players)
110 cards:
70 color cards (14 cards each in five colors)
20 supporter cards (16 squires and four maidens, all in white)
20 action cards (as described below)
25 tokens (five each in five colors)

OVERVIEW
The game consists of many consecutive tournaments. The player who starts a tournament
determines which weapon (color) will be used in it. A tournament may start as jousting
(purple), as a fight with swords (red), axes (blue) or morningstars (yellow), or as a fight
without weapons (green). Usually a tournament is fought with the same weapon (color)
throughout. However, some action cards allow the players to change the current tournament weapon (color).
A player who wins a tournament receives one token of the final color in which the tournament was fought. However, a player who wins a jousting tournament (purple) may take
any color token (due to the prestige of the jousting tournament).

OBJECTIVE
With two or three players, the first player to obtain one token in each of the five colors
wins the game.
With four or five players, the first player to obtain four different color tokens wins the
game.

PREPARATION
Players draw from a pool of five tokens of different colors. The player drawing purple
shuffles and deals eight cards to each player. Place the remaining cards as a facedown
draw deck in the middle of the table. Place all tokens next to the deck (as the pool of
tournament prizes).

SEQUENCE OF PLAY
The player seated to the left of the dealer starts the first tournament. Thereafter it is always
the winner of the previous tournament who starts the next one. The player starting the
tournament always takes the first turn. Play then progresses clockwise. Each player in his
turn may conduct the following steps in the order listed:

1.

3.

Draw a new card
Play cards
Withdraw from the tournament

DRAW A NEW CARD
A player begins his turn by drawing one card from the draw deck. There is no limit to the
number of cards a player may have in his hand. When the last card is drawn from the draw
deck, reshuffle the discard pile and place it face down to form a new draw deck.

STARTING A TOURNAMENT
The player starting a tournament chooses the color in which the tournament will be contested. He may choose any color. He need not have a card of the chosen color, if he has a
supporter in his hand. However, if the final color of the last tournament was purple, the
winner must choose a different color for this next tournament. If the player who is to start
the next tournament only holds action cards, he reveals his hand to prove this, and the next
clockwise player begins the tournament.
The starting player of a tournament must play at least one card face up in front of him,
either of his chosen tournament color or a supporter. He may play additional cards, including action cards, as in a normal turn if he wishes.

PLAY CARDS
Apart from the player starting a tournament, a player is not required to play any cards in
his turn. However, a player must play at least one card from his hand (a color card, a
supporter or an action card) each turn to remain in a tournament. A player may play as
many cards as he wishes. If a player decides to play color cards, they must match the
tournament color.
When a player plays color or supporter cards, he places them face up in front of himself in
an area called his display. All card values must be visible, but cards should partially overlap to indicate the order in which they have been played: the first card lies under the
second, the second under the third, and so on. The last card lies on top. When a player
takes his next turn during the current tournament, he adds newly-played cards to the top of
his display so that previously-played cards can still be seen.
At the end of his turn, a player’s display must contain the highest total card value showing
in order to remain in the tournament. If this is the case, he announces the value of his
display to indicate the end of his turn.

SUPPORTERS
Instead of or in addition to cards of the tournament color, a player
may add supporter cards to his display. Supporter cards of value 2
and 3 are Squires. Each player may have in his display any number

3

of Squire cards. Supporter cards of value 6 are Maidens. Each player may have
only one Maiden card in his display at any one time. If a player withdraws from
a tournament while having a Maiden in his display, he must return one of his
tokens to the prize pool, if he possesses one.

GREEN TOURNAMENTS
In a green tournament, all cards in the display are counted as 1 regardless of
their printed values. The penalty for withdrawing from a tournament while having a Maiden applies to green tournaments as well (even though the Maiden
only counts as 1 for a green tournament).

ACTION CARDS
During his turn, a player may play any number of action cards from his hand. Action cards
may only be played if they can be executed at that point in time. Apart from the SHIELD and
STUNNED cards, all action cards are played face up on the discard pile, and executed right
away.

CHANGE THE T OURNAMENT COLOR
UNHORSE: The tournament color changes from purple to red, blue or yellow, as announced by the player.
CHANGE WEAPON: The tournament color changes from red, blue or yellow to a different one of these colors, as announced by the player.
DROP WEAPON: The tournament color changes from red, blue or yellow to green.
A player may play some color cards, then change the tournament color, and then continue
playing cards of the new color, all in one turn. On the other hand, a player may change the
color of a tournament without playing any color cards at all.
After a change of the tournament color, all cards in the display still count, but all new
cards played must match the new color. In a green tournament, all cards in the display are
counted as 1. However, the cards keep their printed values with respect to any action cards
played.
EXAMPLE: If all cards of lowest value are removed (see CHARGE below), only the
green cards of value 1 are discarded, other color cards and supporters remain, because they have higher printed values.

A FFECT ONE OR MORE DISPLAYS
Various action cards may be played to affect the displays of one, several or all players. The
one overriding rule for all action cards is that a player’s display can never be reduced to

4

IVANHOE

less than one card by the result of an action card. If a player’s display shows only one card,
this card cannot be removed, discarded or taken—though, it may be swapped for another
card. If an action card would lead to the removal of the player’s entire display, then the
first (earliest-played) card remains in his display. After their initial entrance, all players
still fighting in the current tournament will have at least one card displayed in front of
them.
BREAK LANCE: Force one opponent to discard all purple cards from his display.
RIPOSTE: Take the last card played on any one opponent’s display and add it to your
own display.
DODGE: Discard any one card from any one opponent’s display.
RETREAT: Take any one card from your own display back into your hand.
KNOCK DOWN: Draw at random one card from any one opponent’s hand and add it to
your hand, without revealing the card to other opponents.

The following action cards may affect more than one player.
OUTMANEUVER: All opponents must remove the last card played on their displays.
CHARGE: Identify the lowest value card throughout all displays. All players must discard all cards of this value from their displays.
COUNTERCHARGE: Identify the highest value card throughout all displays. All players must discard all cards of this value from their displays.
DISGRACE: Each player must remove all his supporters from his display.
ADAPT: Each player may only keep one card of each value in his display. All other cards
with the same value are discarded. Each player decides which of the matching-value
cards he will discard.
OUTWIT: Place one of your faceup cards in front of an opponent, and take one faceup
card from this opponent and place it face up in front of yourself. This may include the
SHIELD and STUNNED cards.

SPECIAL ACTION CARDS
SHIELD: A player plays this card face up in front of himself, but separate
from his display. As long as a player has the SHIELD card in front of him, all
action cards have no effect on his display.

Copyright © GMT Games, 2000

5

STUNNED: Place this card separately face up in front of any one opponent.
As long as a player has the STUNNED card in front of him, he may add only one
new card to his display each turn.
The SHIELD and STUNNED cards are not part of the display. Only the OUTWIT card
allows a player to move these cards, all other action cards affect the players’
displays only. When a player withdraws from the tournament, his SHIELD and
STUNNED cards go onto the discard pile.
IVANHOE: This is the only card a player can play outside of his turn. A player
can play it at any time as long as he is still in the tournament. Use this card to
cancel all effects of any one action card just played.

WITHDRAWING
A player may withdraw from a tournament at the end of any of his turns. A player need not
play any cards in a tournament before withdrawing. If a player withdraws from the current
tournament, he discards all cards in front of him on the faceup discard pile next to the draw
deck. If a player has a Maiden in his display when he withdraws, he must return one of his
tokens to the prize pool, if he has any tokens. After a player withdraws from a tournament,
he does not take further turns during that tournament.

WINNING A TOURNAMENT
When there are only two players left in a tournament and one of them withdraws,
the other player wins the tournament.
A player who wins a tournament receives one token of the final color in which the tournament was fought. However, a player who wins a jousting tournament (purple) may take
any color token (due to the prestige of the jousting tournament). Each player may possess
only one token of each color. Winning a tournament in a color for which a player already
holds a token prevents one of his opponents from gaining the token, but does not otherwise
help him win the game .The winner of a tournament also discards all faceup cards in front
of him. If nobody has won the game (see Objectives section above), then the tournament
winner starts the next tournament.

PLAY HINTS
Each time a player withdraws from a tournament, he is increasing his hand size by one
card (provided that he did not play a card in the turn of withdrawal). As winning a tournament occurs in another player’s turn, the winner of a tournament will not increase his hand
size. Playing more than one card during your turn usually reduces your hand and diminishes your power.
The card values in purple are highest, followed by red, blue, yellow and green (see chart
on the back page of this rulebook).

Use your cards to win the jousting competitions, and to fight with your sword, axe or morning-star. Rally your squires, gain the support of a maiden, and play action cards against your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clever use of action cards can change the type of tournament that is in progress. One card will 'unhorse' you, forcing everyone still in the jousting competition to switch to a weapon battle of the action card holder&amp;rsquo;s choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other actions cause you to drop whatever other weapon you are using and resort to hand-to-hand battles in which the player with the most cards- not the highest point total- will win a token.
