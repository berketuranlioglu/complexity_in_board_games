________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES

1.0 INTRODUCTION
RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES covers
the two major engagements in the
Second War for Italian Independence in
1859: Magenta, the opening battle of the
war; and Solferino, one of the largest
battles in European pre-20th century
history. It was also a war in which two
emperors—Napoleon III and Franz
Josef—and a king—Victor Emmanuel—
all took battlefield command.
A Word on Complexity. It is the
designer’s intent to give the players the
feel and sweep of a large, 19th century
land battle. At the same time, it is also
our intent to make the game as playable
as possible, within its scope and size. To
that end we have tried to make the
systems and mechanics as simple as
possible, and to keep adherents of both
styles of gaming happy.

the battles greatly, and we apologize
to anyone living in the area who feels
left out.

2.2 The Counters
RISORGIMENTO 1959 contains three
types of counters (playing pieces): 1)
combat units—the infantry battalions,
cavalry regiments and artillery batteries;
2) leaders (virtually all brigadiers); and
3) a variety of informational markers,
such as Hits, used to note status. All
combat units are printed on both sides;
the reverse shows the unit as
“Disordered.” The combat units are
color-coded for ease in identifying to
which command [2.4] they belong.
Play and Design Note: Combat units
do not have any Strength Points, the
usual indication of a unit’s numerical
strength.

2.0 COMPONENTS
The game includes the following items:
2 Game maps (22”x34” and backprinted)
3 Sheets of counters
1 Rulebook
1 Playbook with scenarios
2 Playing aid charts
1 Activation Card
2 Ten-sided dice

2.1 The Maps
The maps cover the area over which the
battles were fought. Each map is
overlaid with a grid of hexagons—
hexes—which are used to regulate
movement. The various types of terrain
represented are discussed in the rules
below. The Solferino battlefield uses two
maps: the Solferino map and the San
Martino map. Magenta and the campaign
map are on the other sides of these maps.
Design Note: The battlefields, and
especially Solferino, are virtually
dotted with small villages, many of
which we have not included for
purposes of clarity. They did not affect

Most units are infantry, organized as
follows:
Austria: Each infantry counter is a
battalion, usually part of a four-battalion
regiment. Usually a Grenzer or Jäger
battalion was attached. Thus, the
regiment has a different name than the
brigade to which it belonged. Thus,
Hoditz’s Brigade (2nd Division of the I
Corps), contains all four battalions of the
Ernst regiment plus the 14th Jäger
battalion.
Historical Note: We use the word
“Austrian” to cover all the units of the
Habsburg Empire, which included a
lot of non-Austrian peoples.

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
France: The French brigades tended to
be bigger. Thus, Goze’s brigade (3/I)
includes the battalions (three each) of the
1st Zouave, 33rd and 34th regiments.
Piedmont-Sardinia: This army was
organized along lines very similar to that
of the Austrians. Thus, Colliano’s
brigade consists of the 1st and 2nd
Grenadiers regiments (four battalions
each—although some counters represent
two battalions), plus the 3rd Bersagliari
battalion.

highly-mobile units which fought in
dispersed formations.
Leader: Those generals (and ranks
below) commanding at brigade level.
Also called Brigadiers.
ZOC: Zone of Control—the ability of a
unit, through its maneuverability and use
of skirmishers, to extend its presence
into adjacent hexes.
2.42 Abbreviations

NOTE: Some units have two brigadiers.
This indicates that the brigade was
commanded by different brigadiers in
each battle. Thus, the 1st Grenadier
Guards was led by Cler at Magenta and
Niol at Solferino.

2.3 The Die
The game uses a ten-sided die to resolve
combat. A 0 is a 0, not a 10.

2.4 Definitions and
Abbreviations
2.41 Key Definitions. Awareness of the
following terms will help as you read
through the rules:
Cohesion: The numerically-rated ability
of a combat unit to withstand the vigors
of combat.
Command: A group of combat units
under one leader/brigadier, the name on
the Command Indicator line on the
counter.
The
basic
“maneuver”
command in this game is the brigade; the
basic activation command in the game is
the corps, with the Piedmontese Army
being treated as one corps.

Full corps commander and brigadier
names can be found in the Orders of
Battle section of the Playbook. Other
significant unit abbreviations on counters
or in the scenario setups are found
below.

• The Austrian battalions contained
about 750 men. However, the
uneducated, multilingual Austrian
trooper had not yet figured out how to
fire his new rifled muskets.
• The French battalions usually had
about 550 men, but their small-arms
weapons, and thus their firepower, was
much better … and, other than the
chasseurs and light infantry, they
mainly relied on the bayonet charge,
which the Austrians, sans firepower,
were not very good at repelling.
• Piedmontese battalions, which had
about 500 men each, had only tepid
training,
little
experience
and
antiquated weapons. Thus, we have
grouped two of these together (except
for a few that were used as
detachments) to render them “equal”
to the others. The Piedmontese
Bersaglieri units held 700+ men each,
so these stand alone.
Cavalry units (regiments) contained
around 500 men each, sometimes
dropping to 400, sometimes as high as
600 or more. The Piedmontese cavalry
was usually around 600.
Each artillery unit represents a 6-8 gun
battery. The batteries are divided into
five types:

Imperial Guard
Jäger
Regiment
Uhlan
Zouave

2.5 The Scale

DRM: Die Roll Modifier—used to
adjust the value of a rolled die.

The map scale for the battles is about
325 yards per hex. Each turn covers
about one hour of real time.

Jägers/Chasseurs: For those not up
fluent in the languages of the opponents,
Jägers and Chasseurs are the same unit
type; the words mean the same thing in
each language—“hunter.” They are

Each infantry unit is a battalion or two
(the latter applies to most of the
Piedmont army). All units are treated as
having the same strength, equalized as
follows:

________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES
To compare overall strengths, using
Solferino as a measuring stick:
• An Austrian corps contained around
18,000 men (somewhat lower for the
undermanned VII and XI Corps)
• French corps ran from 11,000 (III
Corps; see notes on this corps in
playbook) to 22,000 (I Corps).
• The Sardinian Army had about 29,000
men at Solferino, or 50 per cent more
than Benedek’s VIII Corps.

3.0 SEQUENCE OF
PLAY

4.0 THE COMMAND
SYSTEM

Each turn follows a set sequence as
described below.

The Command system is used to
determine an army’s efficiency, its
ability to use its resources. The most
important leaders are the brigadiers.
Higher levels of command—divisions,
corps, army—are covered differently.

A. Initiative Determination Phase
Roll the die to see who goes first
[4.3].

B. Activation Phase

2.6 Ratings
Determining combat/cohesion ratings for
units is, at best, a “pièce de guess,” as
there is no source that lays it out
mathematically, like numbers, guns, etc.
Add to that the fact that the sole combat
rating on most units—Cohesion—covers
a whole lot more than just “cohesion,”
and you have, in respect to other
systems, a lot of seeming anomalies. For
example, the Austrian Jägers were
actually “elite” units, yet their Cohesion
is low. This reflects more their
manpower, formation and tactical
doctrine than the soldiers’ ability. As for
individual ratings, often your guess is as
good as mine, and if you adhere to that
doctrine literally, feel free to bump any
unit up or down. It’s not going to affect
the game greatly.

1.

Reserve Placement Segment.
Both players may place eligible
brigades in Reserve [4.6].
2. Corps Activation Segment.
The Initiative Player selects
which of his corps he wishes to
activate. When a corps is
activated, he may perform
available actions [4.4] with all
of the brigades in that corps.
Each brigade finishes its actions
before the next brigade goes.
3. Continuity Segment. When the
player undergoing B2 finishes
he may now either:
• Pass play to his opponent, in
which case the latter goes
back to B2; or
• Roll for Continuity by
selecting a new corps (it may
NOT be the same corps that
just went) and rolling against
the
selected
Corps
Commander’s
Continuity
Rating. If he succeeds he
returns to B2. If he fails, his
opponent goes to B2. When
all corps are Finished or
players pass in succession
[4.56], go to Phase C.
C. End of Turn Phase.
1. Recovery Segment. Conduct
Recovery for Reserve units
[8.5].
2. Out of Reserve Segment.
Bring commands out of reserve
[4.6].
3. Move Corps Commanders
Segment [4.2]
4. Demoralization
Segment.
Check
for
Corps
Demoralization and Brigade
Hors de Combat [9.0].
5. Start a new turn.

Design Note: The Austrian (and
Piedmontese) leaders, with the
exception of VIII Corps commander,
Benedek, are rated comparatively
lower than their French counterparts.
The Habsburgs used social rank as the
main (if not only) criterion for
advancement in the army, and, in this
war, it served them quite poorly. The
Piedmontese were simply not up to the
level of their allies … at least not yet.

4.1 The Brigadiers and Their
Commands

4.11 Ratings. The brigadiers command
the actual combat units. They have two
ratings, aside from their Movement
Allowance. Brigadiers may move with
their brigade, when their Corps is
activated.
• Commitment DRM: A rating,
expressed as a die roll modifier, used
when any of his In Command units
wishes to attack [7.42].
• Range: Used to determine which of his
combat units is In Command. Units
not within range are Out of Command.
However, if a combat unit is outside
its Brigade leader’s range, but adjacent
to a unit from the same brigade that is

Page 4 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Rulebook

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
In Command, it, too, is considered to
be In Command.

Commitment Rating, would need a
natural roll of 0-3.

Play Note: Thus if only one unit from
a brigade is in Range, but all the
others are adjacent to one another,
they are all In Command.

4.14 Artillery. Most batteries are
assigned to a specific brigade, that
brigade being listed on the second line of
the counter. Thus, the French 7(11)/I
battery—battery #7 of the I Corps—is
assigned to Douay’s brigade. Each sonamed battery is under the command of
its brigadier.

4.12 Command Range. The ability to
“command” troops is maintained through
the Command Range of the brigadier.
This range is the number of Leader
Movement Points (not hexes) over which
the Leader may extend his influence.
Command Range is always counted from
brigadier to combat unit, including the
latter hex, but not the leader’s.
Command cannot be traced through
enemy ZOCs, unless the hex being
traced through is occupied by a friendly
combat unit; i.e., friendly units negate
enemy ZOCs for this purpose.
The Naviglio Canal in Magenta DOES
NOT
block
Corps
Commander
Command Range.
4.13 Orders. Brigades can be either
Under Orders or Without Orders [4.22].
The Orders Status is checked at the
beginning of the Activation Segment;
such status is retained for the whole turn.
Brigadiers that are Without Orders can
attempt to change that to Under Orders.
To do this, the player rolls one die. He
adjusts this roll by the brigadier’s
Commitment DRM.
• If the adjusted roll is 4 or less, his
brigade is Under Orders.
• If the adjusted roll is 5 or more, that
brigade may not do anything, except
Rally.
Example [from Solferino]: Austrian III
Corps is activated. The brigadiers
Pokorny, Dientsel and Wezlar are all
within Schwarzenberg’s Range of 3.
They are Under Orders, and their In
Command combat units have full
capabilities. However, Hartung and
Rosgen are outside Schwarzenberg’s
range, so their brigades are Without
Orders. If the Austrian player wishes,
he may, when it is time to move each
of these brigades, roll to see if they
will become Under Orders. Hartung
would need a natural roll of 0-4;
Rosgen,
because
of
his
+1

There are also a large
minority of batteries that are
“Reserve.” (This includes
batteries in the Austrian
Army Reserves.) These batteries may
never be commanded by infantry
brigadiers. They may, however, be
treated as an individual command when
their corps is activated—i.e., all nonattached batteries are moved/fired at the
same time. These batteries can fire at any
time during that Corps Activation (as if
they were a brigade) but DO NOT have
to be in range of anyone (not even the
Corps Commander).
Play Note: The Austrian’s ID system
for batteries produces a fair number of
units with the same “ID.” There are at
least three batteries of the 10th
cavalry nom de guerre. These are the
10th from three different artillery
regiments, though (e.g., 10cv/II).
Ultimately, the historical ID of the
battery is unimportant for play
purposes; it is the name of the
brigadier of assignment, or the
Reserve notation, that matters.
See 7.12 for how and when batteries may
combine fire.
4.15 Cavalry
France. All French cavalry is assigned
to a specific brigadier, as listed on the
counter.
Austria. The Austrians have cavalry
assigned either to individual Corps or to
the Army Cavalry Reserves.
• Corps-assigned cavalry has no leader;
one unit (per brigade) may be
commanded by any Brigadier in that
corps.
• Army Reserve cavalry is led by a
named brigadier (e.g., the Prinz von

Bayern
Hussars
Vopaterney).

are

by

Piedmont. Piedmontese cavalry brigades
are assigned to divisions; they may not
use Massed Cavalry Attack.
Historical Note: There was a
Piedmontese Cavalry Reserve Division
—Lt.Gen. Sambuy commanded four
regiments of cavalry—but they do not
appear to have been involved in either
battle.
4.16 Massed Cavalry Attack. A player
may decide to use his cavalry in a
Massed Attack. Each player may
undertake one Massed Attack per turn.
To do so, he announces this (within the
parameters below). The eligible cavalry
units must Charge when so activated;
units that do not charge are considered to
not have been activated.
• France. The French Player selects a
cavalry brigadier. All cavalry units,
regardless of assignment, within that
cavalry leader’s range are eligible for
Massed Cavalry Attack. To activate a
Massed Attack, the player uses the
Corps Activation to which the chosen
leader belongs. This is considered to
be that corps’ activation. However,
only the massed cavalry may
move/fight; all other units are not
activated … and it is considered one of
that corps’ activations.
• Austria. Their cavalry operates similar
to the French, with the following
differences:
a) 1st Army cavalry may not
combine with 2nd Army cavalry
(and vice versa).
b) Only
Vopaterny,
Palffy or Zichy are
eligible to lead a
Massed Attack.
c) The Austrian uses the Reserve
Activation for this.
Historical Note: There was a
somewhat ineffective, but massive,
cavalry vs. cavalry battle mid-day,
east of the lightly-cultivated area
around Medole.
4.17 Austrian Reserve Units. Certain
Austrian units (which do not
have their own corps
commander) are activated

Command,
regardless of where they
are.

All units present are considered active
when activating The Reserve. The
Reserve has a Continuity Rating of 2; it
has no other command function.

4.23 Movement. Corps commanders
may move only in the End-Turn Phase in
the Corps Commander movement
segment.

Play Note: It is possible that the 1st
Army Artillery, for example, may
include other batteries. Conversely,
individual cavalry units may be
“attached” to brigades/divisions.

4.24
Guard
Commander.
The
commander of the French Imperial
Guard, St.Jean d’Angely, has two Range
ratings. He may use the higher one (6) if
he is within one hex of Napoleon III.

4.2 Corps-Level Command
Corps commanders provide initiative and
orders for their brigades.

4.25 Piedmont Command. Vittorio
Emanuele acts as both Overall
Commander of the Piedmont army as
well as its (sole) corps commander.
Brigades treat him as a corps
commander. His “3” rating also serves as
his Range and Continuity Ratings when
used as Corps Commander.

4.3 Overall Command
and Initiative
Design Note: We have “skipped” over
the division level of command; the
capabilities of those leaders has been
factored into the Corps Continuity and
Cohesion Ratings.
4.21 Ratings. Corps Commanders have
three ratings:
• Range. The number of Movement
Points (NOT hexes!) that a Brigadier
from that corps must be within to be
Under Orders [4.22]
• Continuity [See 4.5; 9.2].
• Movement Allowance [4.23].
Play Note: The Continuity rating is
also printed on the Activation Card.
4.22 Range and Orders. Brigadiers that
are within range of their corps
commanders are Under Orders. Those
that are not are Without Orders.
• A Brigadier that is Under Orders has
all his combat units within range as In

The abilities of an army’s overall
command are represented by the player,
although we give you each OC as a
counter. The sole purpose of the OC
counter is to provide a DRM for
Initiative, which he may do as long as he
is on the map.
In the Initiative Determination Phase,
each player rolls the die. One of the
players may get to add a modifier to that
roll, depending on the scenario. The high
roller gets the Initiative for that turn. If
tied, roll again. The player with the
Initiative gets a Free Activation [4.52],
indicating which corps command he
wants to start that turn.

4.4 Activation Capabilities
A player’s units are activated by corps.
Corps are activated individually, either
by Free Activation [4.52) or Continuity
[4.51]. When a player’s corps is
activated, all of the brigades (plus
cavalry and artillery) in that corps are
activated, regardless of where they are.
See 4.22 for what status they have.
Play Note: Use the Activation Card
and the Hit markers, to keep track of
the number of Activations a Corps has
undertaken.
4.41 Under Orders. When their brigade
is activated and is Under Orders (4.22),
the individual units that are In
Command may:
• Move
• Fire (if eligible)
• Attack
• Rally (if they have not done any of the
above)
This is the Sequence in which the actions
are undertaken, except that artillery may
Fire either before or after Moving
(small-arms units Fire after Movement).
4.42 Without Orders. When their
brigade is activated and is Without
Orders, or there are individual units that
are Out of Command they may:
• Move, but they may not move adjacent
to an enemy combat unit. If already
adjacent, they may stay or move away.
• Rally (if they have not moved).
• They may NOT fire or attack, but they
will defend normally.
• Artillery Units that are Without
Orders, or Out of Command, may Fire
or Move (not both) when activated.
4.43 Extended Activation. Normally,
each corps may be activated twice in a
single turn. However, a corps may be
activated a third time in a non-weather
turn [4.44], at the risk of increasing the
Hits incurred by the units in that corps.
Whenever a single corps gets an
Extended Activation [4.54]:
• For each unit that moves—and this
does not include movement associated
with combat, such as attack into a hex
or Retreat—roll a die and compare it

Page 6 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Rulebook

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
to that unit’s Adjusted Cohesion. If it
is higher, the unit incurs a Hit.
• Each unit that attacks (fire is not attack
for this purpose) earns an automatic
Hit.
• In an Extended activation, only those
French and Piedmontese Artillery
units that are within range of their
Corps Commander may fire; Austrian
batteries may fire if within range of
their brigadier (or Corps, if Corps or
Reserve Artillery). Artillery may
always Reaction Fire.
Play Note: It is possible for a unit to
incur two Hits during an Extended
Activation.
4.44 Weather Turn. In any turns with
Weather—that means Heat and/or Rain
(see the turn tracks and the scenario
rules)—the normal number of activations
per turn is one. A second activation
would be an Extended Activation … and
there are no third activations.

4.5 Continuity
After a player has undertaken all his
actions with his activated corps he may
either Pass play to his opponent or try to
activate another corps. He does this
through Continuity.
4.51 Continuity Roll. In order for a
player to continue his turn he selects
which corps with which he wishes to do
so and rolls the die. If the roll is:
• Equal to or lower than the Corps
Continuity Rating, that corps is now
activated.
• Higher than the rating, then play
passes to his opponent.
The Corps Commander’s Continuity
Rating is used whether he is on or off of
the map.
Failure of a Continuity Roll does not
count as an activation unless the Corps is
Demoralized [9.2].
4.52 Free Activation. Whenever a
player fails a Continuity Roll, or Passes
to the opponent, the opposing player gets
to activate one of his corps “free”
(without rolling the die). Passing occurs
when a player has corps he can try to

activate but chooses not to do so at the
time.

rule.

4.53 Consecutive Activation. If a player
gets
two
consecutive
activation
segments, his opponent gets a Free
Activation, after which the original
player may resume his Continuity Rolls
[4.51]. No Corps may ever be selected
for activation twice in a row. A player,
having activated Command “A” must
either select a different command for
Continuity or else Pass to the opponent.
An opponent’s “Pass” is considered an
“interruption” for this purpose.
Exception: If the player has only one
command left eligible to be
activated—and it was the one he just
activated—he
may
select
that
command (or Pass). However, in order
to select a command twice in a row
under these circumstances, the player
must roll for Continuity … and a
failed result finishes that command for
that turn.
4.54 Extended Activation. If a player
wishes to use Extended Activation (a
third activation) for a corps, he MUST
make a Continuity Roll for that corps,
even in a normally “Free” situation. A
player may attempt Extended Activation
only once. If the roll fails, that corps is
Finished for the turn. When a corps is
Finished, flip all the Corps’ Brigade
Commanders to their “Finished” side.
4.55 One Side Finished.
Whenever one side has
Finished and the other side
has corps that may still be
activated, activation occurs as follows:
1) The first corps, selected from those
left, gets a Free Activation.
2) For all subsequent corps, the player
rolls the die to activate.
• If the roll is the same as or lower
than the Corps Continuity, the corps
gets a normal activation.
• If the roll is higher, the corps is
activated but may not attack. (It may
fire.)
Play Note: This rule “kicks in”
whenever one side has activated all of
his commands/corps twice; declaring
yourself “Finished” does not trigger the

4.56 End of Activations. The Activation
Phase ends whenever one of the
following occurs:
1) Both players voluntarily Pass
(consecutively) in either of the
following orders:
• Austrian, then French, or
• French, then Austrian, then French.
Failing a Continuity Roll is
considered a Pass for this purpose.

not

2) Neither player has a command that
is eligible to be activated (they are
all “Finished).
Design Note: The different sequence
of Passes represents the overall
French
initiative
advantage,
compliments of their vastly superior
middle and junior level of command.
In essence, the French army was
“active.”

4.6 In Reserve
Brigades may be placed
into Reserve and some
brigades start a battle in
Reserve. Brigades are
placed in Reserve status
only in the Reserve Placement Segment.
All In Command units in a brigade,
regardless of proximity, are together
placed in Reserve. They may voluntarily
be brought out of Reserve only in the
Out of Reserve Segment.
Design Note: This is a tad on the
simplistic side, but it does make the
game easier to play.
4.61 Reserve Effects. Units in Reserve
status:
• May not move, fire or attack.
• May overstack while in Reserve to the
extent that all units from the same
brigade may stack in one hex.
Overstacking applies only to the initial
placement (see Scenario Book). When
units are subsequently placed in
Reserve during the course of the game,
they do not overstack. Rather, they
stay where they are until they are
brought out of Reserve in the Out of
Reserve Segment.

• May Rally and/or Recover [8.5]. Being
in Reserve is the only way a unit can
Recover (Rally is available to any
activated unit).
4.62 Involuntary Release. A brigade
will be released involuntarily from
Reserve the instant any enemy combat
unit moves within three hexes of any of
the brigade’s combat units, regardless of
Chain of Command. Upon such
involuntary release, any Reserve units
that are overstacked get an “interphase”
in which they may move up to one hex
to conform to stacking rules. There are
no restrictions concerning in which
direction the “unstacking” units may
move, other than “no further than one
hex.”
Play Note: Each scenario states
whatever additional restrictions
apply to releasing Reserves, as well
as what turn a corps in Reserve is
automatically released.

5.0 MOVEMENT
A
Movement
Allowance
(MA)
represents the maximum number of
Movement Points (MPs) that any unit
may “normally” expend during a single
activation segment. Units may always
move less than their allowed MA.

5.1 Strategic Movement
A unit using Strategic
Movement (SM) places a
Strategic
Movement
marker near it, to so
indicate. That marker may not be
removed from the unit until its next
activation (if it chooses not to continue
using SM). Units use Strategic
Movement by brigade. Either all units in
the brigade use it, or none does. See 7.45
for combat effects.
Units that are Without Orders that are
not already using Strategic Movement
may not use SM. They may stop using
SM, though. This does not apply to
entering Reinforcements or units
activated from the Reserve.

5.11 Movement Effects. Using SM, the
unit’s MA is double what is printed on
the counter. However, when using SM:
• No unit may start or move within
THREE hexes of any enemy combat
unit. A unit cannot move in Strategic
Mode within three hexes of an enemy
unit, even if the former can’t see the
latter (it’s not what they can see, it’s
what they think might be out there).
• Units may not move in any HeavilyCultivated hex unless it is by Road
(not Trail). In Magenta, those are all
roads (some major, some minor)
except for the RR, which is treated as
a Trail, and thus may not be used for
SM through the vineyards.
• Units may not move in any LightlyCultivated hex unless it is by Road or
Trail.
• Only one combat unit is allowed in any
one hex.
Units that are Without Orders that are
not already using Strategic Movement
may not use SM. They may stop using
SM, though. This does not apply to
entering Reinforcements or units
activated from Reserve.
5.12 Artillery SM. The maximum MA
of a non-horse artillery unit using
strategic movement is 10. Horse artillery
use SM like infantry or cavalry.
Artillery using Strategic Movement
cannot fire (not even in reaction).

5.2 Terrain
A unit expends Movement Points for
each hex it enters. MP costs depend on
unit type and terrain entered (see the
Terrain Effects Chart). Movement
into/across certain terrain types will
cause certain units to become Reduced.
5.21 Roads. Units using Roads pay the
Road cost if they are entering that hex
from a hex containing a connecting road
hex; otherwise, they pay the cost of the
other terrain in the hex. A unit using a
road to cross an elevated hexside, or a
ridge, treats that hexside as the next
lower-level hexside. Thus, the road
leading from S1424 into S1425 allows

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
the unit to ignore the elevation change
cost. A Major Road is different from a
Minor Road only in that it is not affected
by Rain (see Playbook).
5.22 Trails and Railroads. Trails halve
(rounding fractions down) the cost to
enter a specific type of hex. However,
they have no effect on elevation costs.
Railroads are treated as if they were
Trails.
5.23 Water Terrain. Running water is
treated as follows:
• The River Ticino (Magenta map) is
impassable, except where traversed by
bridges.
• Canals and Deep Streams are difficult
to cross; for some unit types they are
uncrossable (see Terrain Effects
Chart). In addition, infantry crossing
such hexsides incurs an automatic
Disorder.
• Shallow Streams are treated as
indicated in the Terrain Effects Chart.
• Fords. Where Roads cross streams
without a bridge, that is considered a
Ford. Trails do not create fords.
Design Note: It’s somewhat difficult to
determine the effect of the streams and
canals, especially at Solferino, mostly
for lack of narrative information. The
canals were at least three yards wide,
and deeper than a man … but no more
than 10-15 yards wide. That makes
them a problem, but not a major
barrier. As for the streams, their
difficulty lay in the fact that most were
“sunk” into the terrain, with fairly
steep banks. The battle descriptions do
not mention any great difficulties with
these barriers (except for the big canal
flowing through Medole). This could
mean that they avoided them, of
course.
5.24 Elevated Terrain. The hexsides
where the elevation changes (for game
purposes, if not in reality) are called
Slopes. There are three types of Slope,
each with a different visual indication
(see the sample terrain on the maps):
• Gradual: One-level change (no icon)
• Sharp: Two-level change
• Steep: Three-level change

Rough. All hexes on level 4 and 5 are
Rough Terrain (some are also Wooded
and Rough).

Play Note: The important rule for
Magenta is No Stacking if you want to
use roads/Trails through these hexes.

Artillery Firing Angle. Artillery firing
over distances must consider the total
number of level changes as affecting
the angle of their fire. For example,
Artillery firing up two levels over a
distance of several hexes would be
considered as firing up a Sharp slope
for terrain effects purposes.

5.28 Towns and Villages. These are
treated distinctly, mostly in terms of
movement and combat benefits [see 5.5
on Towns]. Hexes with only one
building are treated like the other terrain
in the hex.

5.25 Ridges (Solferino only). Ridges
represent sharp, but narrow, rises in
elevation. The color of the ridge hexside
is its level, comparable to the color code
for hex levels. (Most are one level above
the surrounding terrain; a few are
steeper.) The cost to cross a Ridge is
based on its elevation level change, as
listed on the Terrain Effects Chart. Note,
though, that when crossing a ridge such
movement negates any elevation change
cost for the hex entered.
Example: an infantry unit moving from
S2218 to S2117 would pay 3 MPs (one
to enter the hex plus two for crossing a
Sharp Ridge). The Ridge negated the
Slope elevation cost between the two
hexes.
5.26 Impassable Hexsides. Certain
hexes/hexsides are impassable; units
may not enter or cross them (unless they
are traversed by a Bridge or Road). Note
that the “one hex” allowance rule [5.31]
does not allow passage of impassable
hexes/hexsides.
Example: Cavalry and artillery units
may not cross Steep Slope hexsides,
unless by Road.
5.27 Cultivated Hexes. Most level 2
hexes on the Magenta map are Heavily
Cultivated. Aside from the movement
costs, Heavily-Cultivated hexes have
some unusual rules regarding ZOC
[6.23], movement and combat (see
Magenta in the Playbook). The LightlyCultivated hexes at Solferino also have
important ZOC rules in addition to their
costs.

5.29 Castles. Essentially, there are only
two: one above the village of Solferino,
and Monte Rolondo at Magenta. Only
one unit may gain/use the benefits of a
castle—and that unit may not be cavalry.
All other units are considered outside the
castle. If more than one unit is in that
hex, the bottom unit is considered to be
inside the castle. When a castle hex is
attacked, the units outside the hex are
treated
separately,
and
attacked
separately.

5.3 Movement Restrictions
As a unit moves it traces a path of
contiguous hexes through the hex grid,
paying the cost of each hex entered.
Each unit moves separately, and one
unit’s movement must be completed
before another can begin. A unit may be
moved in any direction or combination
of directions. A unit’s Facing [6.1] has
no effect on how or where it may move.
Exception: See the Awareness rule for
the
Heavily-Cultivated
hexes
at
Magenta.
5.31 Entrance Minimum. A moving
unit must have enough MP’s to pay the
terrain (and ZOC) cost of entering a hex;
if it doesn’t, it may not enter that hex.
However, a unit may move one hex,
regardless of available MP, if it is
permitted to enter that hex at all.
5.32 Firing Artillery.
Artillery units that fire
may also move, but they
may use only half
(rounded down) of their
MA for that segment. Artillery units may
move, and then fire. Artillery units
move, and then fire after completion of
movement by their whole Corps. In this

________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES
case, such fire incurs a –1 DRM.
Artillery using Strategic Movement may
not fire in that activation.
5.33 Adjacency Prohibitions. Cavalry
may not move adjacent to an enemy
combat unit unless such movement is
part of a Charge. Artillery units may not
move adjacent to an enemy unit unless
the two are separated by impassable
terrain.
5.34 Protected Entry. No unit may
move within two hexes of an enemy
Entry Hex [5.6] until all reinforcements
have entered the game.

5.4 Stacking
Stacking refers to having more than one
unit in a hex at any one time.
5.41 Normal Stacking. The basic rules
are:
1) Up to TWO infantry or cavalry units
of the same brigade may stack
together. Cavalry and infantry units
may not stack together. If they start a
scenario stacked together (which is
sometimes the case), they must
unstack by the end of their first
activation.
Example: Two infantry battalions from
Dauber’s brigade (VIII, Austrian) may
stack together. But one of Dauber’s
units may not stack with one of
Lippert’s, even though they are from
the same division (Lang).
2) ONE artillery unit may stack with one
infantry or cavalry unit (regardless of
parent command).
3) THREE artillery units may stack
together.
4) When using Strategic Movement, only
one combat unit is allowed per hex.
5) When in Reserve status, units may
overstack at no penalty.
6) Infantry in a Town have special
restrictions [5.5].

7) Markers and Leaders do not count for
stacking purposes.
5.42 Combat Stacking. Stacking
restrictions apply at all times, except
during an attack. A unit may move into a
hex containing an enemy unit—that is
how attack occurs [7.42]. A unit may not
move through a hex containing an enemy
combat unit.
5.43 Stacking Order and Fire. Artillery
may fire regardless where they are in a
stack. Jägers, Chasseurs and Lights may
fire only if they are the top unit in a
stack.
5.44 Stacking Order. When a unit
enters a friendly-occupied hex, it is
always placed at the bottom of the
resulting stack. The stacking order can
only be changed at the beginning of
movement, and doing so costs 1 MP.
Additionally, a stack in an enemy ZOC
cannot change its stacking order.

5.5 Towns
The narrow streets, close, stone
buildings and walled perimeters of the
Italian towns (e.g., Magenta) made for
strong defensive positions. This rule
does NOT apply to villages.
5.51 Town Stacking. A player may
stack up to three infantry units, or two
infantry and one artillery unit, in a town
hex, regardless of their parent
organization.
Cavalry
stacking
restrictions still apply.

5.53 Town Restrictions. A unit that
starts its movement in a town hex that is
taking advantage of town stacking pays
an extra MP to leave that hex. Only two
units may attack out of a Town hex, even
if there are three in that hex. This
includes firing Jägers, Chasseurs or
Light Infantry.
5.54 Cavalry and Towns. Cavalry does
not gain ANY of the benefits of a Town
hex (including the terrain benefit applied
to infantry). They may not charge an
enemy in a Town hex.

5.6 Reinforcements
Reinforcements enter the game in the
turn listed in the reinforcement arrival
schedule for the scenario (see Playbook).
They enter when their corps is activated.
They enter through the Entry Hex(es)
stated in the scenario, as if they were in a
“line” extending off the map. That is, the
first unit in that command pays the cost
to enter the map edge. Each additional
reinforcing unit that enters the map pays
the terrain cost multiplied by the number
of reinforcement units that have entered
ahead of it through that entry hex.
Some Reinforcements specify that they
may be activated only once that turn.
This represents units that arrived about
halfway through the turn’s time frame.
Reinforcements may enter using
Strategic Movement, if they are eligible
and the player wishes.

5.52 Town Effects. If two or more
infantry units are in any one town hex,
they each gain the following advantages:
• They have all-around, six-hex frontal
facing and ZOC. However, that ZOC
does not extend into HeavilyCultivated or Woods hexes [6.23].
• When leaving the hex, or attacking out
of that hex, they may do so through
any one hexside.
These advantages do not apply to single
infantry units in a town hex, nor do they
apply to cavalry.

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
6.12 Attack Facing. A unit may attack
only into its Frontal hexes, with some
restrictions [6.23].
6.13 Artillery Facing. Stacked artillery,
or an artillery unit stacked with an
infantry unit, do NOT have to have the
same facing. Any facing effects on the
attack DR apply to the infantry unit’s
orientation.

6.0 POSITION
The position of counters (facing,
adjacency and zones of control) have an
impact upon what units can and/or must
do in the game.

6.1 Facing
All units must be faced in a hex so that
the top of the unit (the side with its unit
name) faces along one of the hexsides, as
shown below. All units in a hex must be
faced the same way (except as noted in
6.13 and 6.14). The three hexes to the
front are called the Frontal hexes; those
behind, the Rear.

6.14 Square. To protect against a
cavalry charge, non-Jäger/Chasseur
infantry unit(s) (within normal stacking
limits [5.41]) may assume different
facings to form a Square. To do so the
unit must not be adjacent
to an enemy unit and
must pay 1 MP to do so,
after which it may move
no further that turn. Place
a Square marker atop the unit. Square
confers the following effects:
• Units in Square may not move.
• All hexes adjacent to the Square are
Frontal.
• All units in the Square may fire, but
they still fire separately.
• Cavalry units add one (+1) to their
Charge Commitment die roll [7.42]
when charging a Square.
Units may leave Square by paying 1 MP.
They may not do so if adjacent to an
enemy unit.
6.15 Rally Facing. Rallied units may
change facing [7.9].
6.16 Facing Change after Combat. An
attacking unit may change facing one
vertex (in the combat hex) after forcing
the defender to retreat.

6.2 Zones Of Control (ZOC)
6.11 Movement Facing. Facing has no
effect on movement, and a unit is free to
change its facing at any time, during and
at the end of movement. Units do not
have to be facing a particular hex to
enter that hex.
Exception: See 6.33 regarding presence
in enemy frontal ZOC.

Zones of Control represent the extension
of a unit’s presence outside the
immediate hex in which it is located,
usually
through skirmishers and
maneuverability.
6.21 Frontal ZOCs. Infantry and
cavalry units exert a ZOC into all three
Frontal hexes adjacent to the hex they

occupy. There are no ZOCs to a unit’s
Rear.
Exception: Artillery and Disordered
units do not exert any ZOC.
6.22 ZOC Limitations. A ZOC does not
extend:
• Across impassable hexsides or into
Town hexes
• Through bridges (but they do extend
across Fords).
• UP sheer or steep hexsides (but they do
extend DOWN for infantry).
6.23 Cultivated Hex ZOCs. Much of the
Magenta battlefield is heavily-cultivated
farm land—a maze of vineyards, trees
and other types of dense cultivation. The
same applies to much of the southern
plain of the Solferino battlefield,
although the growth is not quite as
entangled and more sporadic, for which
we have Lightly-Cultivated hexes. In
addition to the movement costs to
navigate this thicket of greenery, a unit
in a Heavily- or Lightly-Cultivated hex
exerts a ZOC only into the one hex
directly to its front.
Exception: ZOCs extend into any
frontal hex directly connected by a
road or Trail.
Units in a Heavily-Cultivated hex may
attack only into one of their controlled
hexes. This does not apply to units in
Lightly-Cultivated hexes, even though
they may exert a ZOC only directly
frontal.
Play Note: See the Magenta scenario in
the Playbook for additional rules
concerning this.
6.24 Enemy ZOCs and Command.
Enemy ZOCs block command range but
are negated if the hex into which the
enemy ZOC is exerted is occupied by a
friendly unit. See also 4.12.

6.3 Moving Adjacent
The cost to move adjacent to an enemy
unit represents the time and difficulty it
takes to deploy for an attack. See also
5.33 for adjacency prohibitions.

Copyright © GMT Games, 2000 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Page 11

________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES
6.31 Added Movement Cost. The costs
(in addition to the cost of the terrain
itself) to move adjacent to an enemy
infantry or cavalry combat units are:
• All regular infantry pay +2 MPs to
enter an enemy ZOC.
• All regular infantry pay +1 MP to
move adjacent to any enemy combat
unit, but not into a ZOC hex.

6.32 Stops Movement. Units must stop
upon moving into to an enemy ZOC
(although they can alter their facing as
they enter that hex). They do not have to
stop if they do not enter a ZOC.
6.33 Inhibits Movement. A unit that
starts movement in an enemy ZOC may
do one of three things, in terms of
movement:

6.34 Cavalry Withdrawal. If an enemy
infantry unit is about to
move adjacent, or, if
already starting adjacent,
wishes to enter a hex
occupied by a cavalry unit,
the cavalry may react by withdrawing
two hexes away. The enemy may move
into the vacated hex and then continue
moving if it has MPs remaining. If
moving adjacent, it does pay the cost to
enter the cavalry ZOC once the latter has
withdrawn (for Cavalry only; not for
Horse Artillery). If already adjacent,
there is no extra MP cost. Horse
Artillery—those batteries with an MA of
8—is considered to be cavalry for the
purpose of Withdrawing, but the enemy
infantry unit does NOT pay the cost to
enter the ZOC once the HA unit has
withdrawn.
Cavalry may Withdraw even if the
subject of a Surprise Attack (Magenta).
Exception: Cavalry cannot withdraw if
it is in the ZOC of another enemy unit.
6.35 Jäger/Chasseur Withdrawal.
Jäger and Chasseur units [7.2] may, even
if Disordered, withdraw before an enemy
unit moves into one of its ZOC hexes.
To withdraw, the unit moves one hex to
the rear. The enemy unit may move no
further, but the withdrawing unit may
not Reaction Fire.

7.0 COMBAT

Example: A unit in M2403 is facing into M2503. It extends a ZOC into M2503, as
that is its directly frontal hex, and into M2404, because of the road. It does not
do so into M2502, even though the latter is a frontal hex.
• Light infantry and Jägers/Chasseurs
pay +1 MP to move adjacent to an
enemy, including a ZOC hex.
• There is no MP cost to move adjacent
to an enemy artillery unit not stacked
with supporting infantry/cavalry.
• Cavalry may move adjacent to an
enemy unit only as part of a Charge
[7.5], though there is no additional MP
cost.

• Stand still
• Stay and change its facing one hexside
(not more).
• They may leave an enemy ZOC if they
start their phase there, but to do so
costs one additional MP (in addition to
the terrain cost of the hex entered), and
that unit may not move directly into
another enemy ZOC.

Combat consists of three types: artillery
fire, a limited amount of Small-Arms
Fire and attack (which combines closerange fire and charges).
• Artillery cannot attack [7.35].
• Small-Arms Fire is limited to Jägers,
Chasseurs and Light infantry [7.2].
Design Note: We have combined the
usual fire and shock aspects of combat
into one mechanic. This is as much a
result of the scale (325 yards per hex)
as our desire to keep things as
accessible as possible.

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________

7.1 Artillery Fire
Artillery may fire any
time it is activated, once
per activation segment
(see 5.32 for movement effects of firing).
Artillery can change facing (without
leaving the hex) and fire in the same
phase. It may also fire in Reaction,
during an opposing player’s activation
segment [7.17]. Artillery can fire only
through its frontal hexes.
7.11 Fire Procedure. Artillery fire is
resolved by rolling the die for each firing
unit, and adjusting that roll [see 7.18 on
fire resolution]. Artillery fire results
affect all units in the target hex,
individually. The effectiveness of the fire
largely depends upon gun type and
range.
• Gun Type: The gun type is printed on
the counter: F, for Field, H for Heavy,
R for Rockets and Rf for Rifled. The
Horsehead indicates Horse Artillery.
• Ranged Fire: Artillery may fire at
targets more than one hex away. The
maximum distance, in hexes, over
which artillery may fire is printed on
the counter. Range effects are used as
a DRM to the fire resolution (consult
the Artillery Range Effects Chart for
the DRM for that type at that range).
Ranged fire may also be restricted by
Line-of-Sight considerations [7.13].
Historical Note: The French Imperial
Guard’s brand new, muzzle-loading
rifled guns were superior to that of
either the Austrians or Piedmontese,
at least in terms of accuracy and
range. However, it appears that the
French did not have (or use) grape or
canister for the new rifled barrels,
which is why they have lower ratings
at short ranges.
7.12 Combined Fire. If artillery units
from the same Corps are stacked in the
same hex, or in adjacent hexes, they may
combine fire IF (and only if) they are
within range of the Corps Commander.
Army Reserve batteries may be assigned
to any corps for this purpose, OR they
may combine fire as part of the Army
Reserve activation (but not both).
Example:
Schwarzenberg
can
command any/all batteries from the III

corps, whether they are in his Reserve
or assigned to a specific brigade.
When combining fire, ADD TWO to the
roll for EACH additional battery.
Otherwise, artillery units fire separately.
If guns of different type combine fire,
they use the “worst” Range DRM.
Exceptions:
• French artillery may only combine fire
when stacked in the SAME HEX.
• Piedmont batteries may NOT combine
fire.
7.13 Line of Sight. Artillery firing at a
range of two hexes or more—counted
from guns to target, not counting the hex
the firing unit is in—can fire only if they
can see the target (called having a Line
of Sight). Intervening elevations and
units (friendly or otherwise) can block
the Line of Sight (LOS) to the target.
Ridges are treated as the level of their
color. Woods, Villages, Towns and
Castles are treated as being one level
higher than the hex they are in.
LOS is blocked if:
• Any intervening hex is of a higher
elevation than both target and firing
hex.
• Any intervening hex between target
and firer is Woods, HeavilyCultivated, or a hex occupied by a
combat unit (friendly or otherwise),
and neither target nor firer is at a
higher
elevation
than
that
woods/occupied hex.
• The firing hex is higher than the target
and higher than the intervening Woods
or Heavily-Cultivated hex, and if the
obstruction is halfway between the
two or closer to the target.
• The target hex is higher than the firing
hex and higher than the intervening
woods or HC hex, and if the woods is
halfway between the two or closer to
the firing hex.
The hexside of a potentially blocking
hex is part of that hex and thus that hex
will block LOS that travels along that
hexside. Artificial? You bet.
If both target and firing hexes are higher
than intervening obstructions, fire is
allowed (for the benefits of firing from a
higher elevation, see 7.14).

7.14 Elevated Fire. Guns at a
measurably higher elevation than their
targets were usually more effective, as
long as the target was not too close.
Therefore, if the target is NOT
ADJACJENT, then artillery gains the
following elevation benefits:
• +1 DRM if firing down two levels
• +2 DRM if firing down three levels
Artillery may not fire at an adjacent
hex that is two or more levels higher
or lower.
7.15 Dispersed Target. If the hex
contains only Jägers or Chasseurs, the
player applies a –2 DRM.
7.16 Massed Target. When artillery
fires at any hex in which there are two or
more non-artillery units stacked, it gets a
+1 DRM. Jägers and Chasseurs do not
count.
7.17 Reaction Fire. Artillery batteries
may fire during an opposing player’s
activation segment, in Reaction to
certain actions by that player. They may
do one of each type of fire listed below
for each activation segment.
• Counter-Battery Fire. An artillery
unit may always fire back at any
artillery unit that fires at it. Such fire is
not simultaneous; it occurs after the
original fire, and the unit may only
Counter-Battery Fire once in each
activation segment.
• Pre-Attack Fire. An
artillery battery that
is about to be fired at
[7.2] or attacked
[7.3], or into whose
frontal hex an enemy unit moves, may
fire at any one frontal hex. It may do
so only once in each activation
segment.
Play Note: Thus, a battery may either
fire when an enemy moves adjacent or
wait until it decides to attack. The
choice is up to the non-phasing player.
7.18 Fire Resolution. Roll the die and
add or subtract any modifiers to fire (see
below). Then consult the Artillery Fire
Table for the result. Note: Disordered
artillery may not fire.

The artillery fire roll may be adjusted by:
• Range [7.11]
• Terrain (see the Terrain Effects Chart)
• Combined Fire—add two for each
additional battery firing [7.12]
• Elevated Fire [7.14]
• Massed or Dispersed Target [7.15
and 7.16]

KEY TO FIRE RESULTS:
NE No Effect
CDR Cohesion Die Roll: Roll a die and
compare it to the unit’s present
Cohesion. If higher than that
rating, the unit is Disordered; if
not, then there is no effect. The
CDR result has no effect on
artillery.
D
All units in hex Disordered
D+1 All units in hex Disordered, 1 Hit
is applied to any one unit.

• If stacked with non-Jäger/Chasseur
units, and the stack is attacked, ignore
the Jägers/Chasseurs (regardless of
stacking order). They take Hits from
an enemy attack only if there are no
units left.
• Pay only +1 MP above terrain costs to
move adjacent to an enemy unit.
• When an enemy unit moves into a
Jäger/Chasseur ZOC, and the Jäger/
Chasseur is the only unit in the hex,
the Jäger/Chasseur unit has two
choices:
1) Stand and defend (they may use
Reaction Fire), OR
2) Withdraw one hex to the rear (may
not use Reaction Fire), but the
enemy unit may move no further.
Jägers/Chasseurs
may
not
Withdraw if they are the subject
of a Surprise Attack (Magenta).
Cavalry may.

7.2 Jägers, Chasseurs and Light
Infantry
Design Note: Jäger and Chasseur
battalions are prohibited from attack
simply because, while they were trained
in shock attack, it does not appear that
they were used for that purpose during
this war. The Austrian light infantry is
mostly second-line, Grenzer battalions,
and, while the French light infantry is
rated much better, it was usually
somewhat smaller (at least as far as we
can tell). Anyway, it made up for size
with skill at more than one job. It also
provides a dash of flavor for the stew
that is wargaming.
The only units that may use Small-Arms
Fire are Jägers and Chasseurs (those
units with a yellow-boxed cohesion
rating) and Light Infantry (those units
with a white-boxed cohesion rating).
Small-Arms Fire-capable units may fire
only if they are the top unit in a stack.

7.21 Jäger/Chasseur Capabilities:
• May only fire; they may never attack.

7.22 Light Infantry Capabilities:
• May fire and attack when activated.
• When attacking with any Light
Infantry, the attacker incurs a –1 DRM
to his attack die roll.
(Note: Disregard the CRT – such
penalty is incurred with ANY Light
Infantry, not just when attacking with
more than half LI, as the CRT states.)
7.23 Small-Arms Fire. This type of fire
(restricted to Jägers, Chasseurs and Light
Infantry) takes place only into adjacent,
frontal hexes. To fire, the player rolls the
die, applies any terrain or Disorder
effects—the only DRMs that affect
small-arms fire—and checks the SmallArms Fire Table. Units may not combine
Small-Arms Fire. Units capable of
Small-Arms Fire may do so only once in
an activation segment, and only into one
hex.
Fire may be directed across non-elevated
hexes across which an attack would
normally not take place (e.g., a canal
hexside, across which the units most
certainly could fire).

7.24 Small-Arms Reaction Fire. Much
like artillery pre-attach Reaction Fire
[7.17], small-arms fire may occur during
an enemy activation segment. However,
each unit may do this only one time in
each segment, either after being fired at
OR before being attacked.
7.25 Small-Arms Fire Results. The
result is either No Effect, or else the
target unit gets 1 Hit.

7.3 Infantry Attack
Design Note: “Attack” combines
close-range musketry with the
subsequent display of “cold steel”, the
bayonet charge.
Any active infantry unit—except for
Jägers and Chasseurs—may attack any
enemy unit(s) in its ZOC [See 7.5 for
cavalry]. Attacking is voluntary. A
single activated unit may attack into only
one hex. Even if both Frontal hexes are
enemy-occupied, a single unit may
attack against only one (attacker’s
choice). If there are two activated units
in a hex, they may either combine and
attack into one hex [7.31], or split and
attack into one different hex each. This
choice is made before any Commitment
die rolls [7.42]. Defenders stacked
together are combined.
7.31 Combined Attack. Attacking units
from the same brigade may combine
their “strength” if:
• They start stacked together, or
• They start in adjacent hexes.
Non-adjacent
separately.

units

must

attack

Units from the same corps, but different
brigades, may not attack together.
7.32 Separate Attacks. If attacking
separately, the order is up to the
attacking player. If one of the attackers is
doing so across a hexside which would
give different die roll modifiers, the
defender gets the benefit of the terrain
DRM which is best for him.
7.33 Attack Restrictions:

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
• Artillery never participates in attack.
If stacked with infantry or cavalry, the
artillery suffers any retreat results
incurred by the infantry or cavalry. It
may not be used to take a Hit result,
though. If attacked while alone in a
hex (or stacked with another artillery
unit), it is automatically eliminated.
• Cavalry may not attack; it must charge
[7.5].
• Jägers and Chasseurs may not attack.
They defend only if they are the only
units in the defending hex.
• Light Infantry may fire and attack/
defend [7.22].
• Disordered units may not attack
(although, if capable, they may fire).

7.4 Resolving Attack
Attacks are undertaken by activated units
that began the activation In Command,
and are conducted AFTER all movement
and fire has been completed (by all
activated units). Attack is always
voluntary. An activated unit may launch
an attack on any enemy unit(s) in its
Frontal hexes, unless they are separated
by an uncrossable hexside. Disordered
units may not attack; they will defend
(with a DRM).
7.41 Commitment. To attack, the
activated unit must enter the enemyoccupied hex. Attack resolution occurs
when opposing units occupy the same
hex.
To enter an enemy hex, each unit must
pass a Commitment die roll. All
Commitment die rolls for the brigade are
undertaken before any attacks are
resolved. Roll the die, adjusted as below,
and compare it to the Cohesion Rating
(as adjusted, see 8.12) of the unit.
The roll is adjusted (up or down) by the
Commitment DRM of its brigadier, if the
unit is within his range at the time of the
die roll.
If the DR is equal to or lower than the
adjusted Cohesion, the unit must enter
the enemy hex and attack. If the DR is
higher than the adjusted Morale, it may
not move or attack.

7.42 Combined Commitment. If there
are two units in an attacking hex, the top
unit attempts Commitment first. If it
passes, the bottom unit follows
automatically. If it fails, neither unit may
Commit.
7.43 Attack Stacking. Stacking
restrictions do not apply in the attack/
target hex during the attack, but they
apply afterwards. After the loser has
retreated out of the contested hex, the
winner must “retreat” all units above the
stacking limits (back into the hexes from
whence they came). The loser retreats
his units first (see also 8.33).
Play Note: As each unit undertakes
Commitment individually, and a
committed unit must attack, it is
entirely possible that some multi-unit
attacks will not be quite as “multi” as
the player hoped.
7.44 Attack Procedure. Attacks are
resolved, one hex at a time, in any order
the activated player wishes. To resolve
the attack, both the attacker and defender
each roll the die. Each player adds (or
subtracts) any of his applicable DRMs,
depending on whether he is attacker or
defender [7.45]. The result is the number
of Hits inflicted upon the opposing unit
[8.0]. Results apply immediately to all
affected units, before proceeding to the
next combat.
7.45 Attack and Charge DRMs. The
following DRM apply to attack. All
DRMs are cumulative.
ATTACKER DRMS
Strength Comparison. If the attacker
has more units than the defender, he
earns a DRM equal to the difference.
The DRM is always “positive,” and
applies only to the numerically
superior player. Example: Three
Austrian units attack one French unit.
The Austrian would get a +2 DRM as
the attacker. There would be no DRM
for the defender.
Higher Cohesion. The side with the unit
with the highest Cohesion ADDS
ONE to its roll. If tied, neither side
benefits.
Position DRMs. If any units are
attacking by entering the target hex

through the target’s Rear hexside,
ADD ONE to the attacker’s roll. If
attacking units are attacking through
both Front and Rear hexsides, ADD
TWO to the roll. The attackers get this
DRM as long as they are Committed
to Attack the hex; if more than one
unit is attacking, they do have to
combine [7.31] their attacks to gain
such DRM benefit.
Terrain DRM. Check the Terrain
Effects Chart for any Terrain DRM
that negatively affects the attacker’s
roll.
Strategic Movement. If
defender
is
using
Strategic Movement, the
attacker gets a +2 DRM.
Morale. If any defender is
from a brigade that is
Hors de Combat [9.1],
the attacker gets a +1
DRM.
Unit Type. If ALL
defending
units
are
Jägers or Chasseurs, the
attacker gets a +2 DRM.
If only some of the
defenders are Jäger/
Chasseur, simply ignore
them. If more than half
of the attackers are Light
Infantry, the attacker
incurs a –1 DRM.
Cavalry
Charge
vs.
Infantry [7.5]. If more
than half of an attacking
force is Light Cavalry
charging infantry, it
incurs a –2 DRM for
attacker.
Cavalry Charge vs. Cavalry [7.5].
Heavy Cavalry charging
Light Cavalry receives
a +1 DRM.
Light Cavalry charging
Heavy Cavalry incurs
a –1 DRM.
If the attackers (or
defenders) are mixed
types, there is no
DRM.
Surprise (Magenta only,
see
Playbook).
An
attacking unit gains a +2
DRM.

________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES
DEFENDER DRMS
Strength Comparison. If defender has
more units, he earns a DRM equal to
the difference. The DRM is always
“positive,” and applies only to the
numerically superior player. Example:
If one French attacked three
Austrians, the latter, as defender,
would get a +2 DRM.
Higher Cohesion. The side with the unit
with the highest Cohesion ADDS
ONE to its roll. If tied, neither side
benefits.
Disordered. If any defender is
Disordered, he SUBTRACTS ONE
from his roll.
Infantry defending vs. Cavalry. ADD
TWO to the defender’s roll [see 7.53].
(This represents the infantry’s
firepower).
7.46 Unsupported Artillery. Artillery
units that are alone in a hex (with no
infantry or cavalry support) are
automatically eliminated when attacked,
after they use Reaction Fire (see 7.61
regarding Horse Artillery). The attackers
first must pass Commitment for this to
happen.
7.47 Continued Attack. Any time the
attacker has lost fewer Hits than the
defender (and, therefore, controls the hex
he attacked [8.31], he may (voluntary)
attempt to Continue his attack. He may
do so only with the unit(s) that remain in
the hex after meeting stacking limits
[7.43]. To do this, he rolls the die,
subtracting the difference between
enemy Hits suffered and victorious Hits
suffered, and compares the adjusted roll
it to the adjusted Morale of the unit
intended to attack again.
• If the adjusted roll is the same as or
lower than the adjusted Morale, that
unit (or stack) may move into any one
hex adjacent to the original battle hex
and attack any enemy therein, using
regular combat rules.
• If the adjusted roll is higher, the units
stay in the original battle hex, and
there is no further movement.
Example: Thus, if the attacker loses 1
Hit and the defender loses Hits, the
attacker, as winner, may opt to
attempt Continued Attack with a –2
DRM.

At the conclusion of the Continued
Attack, regardless of the result, the
unit(s) that Continued suffer 1 Hit each.
Only one Continued Attack may be
undertaken by each unit in an activation
segment.

7.5 Cavalry Charge
Historical Note: Cavalry effectiveness
was much reduced since the Napoleonic
era, mostly because of the increased
range and effectiveness of infantry fire.
A big cavalry action occurred at
Solferino, in the plains west of Medole.
Very little cavalry was at Magenta,
although the French Chasseurs of the
Guard did charge, and take, an Austrian
entrenched position.
To attack an enemy unit, cavalry must
Charge. Charges are undertaken by
activated units that began the activation
In Command, and are conducted AFTER
all movement and fire has been
completed (by all activated units).
Charge is always voluntary. To Charge
in its segment, the cavalry unit must
Charge into the target’s hex, starting at
least two, but not more than three, hexes
away. A cavalry unit may Charge only
against a target it can see before it started
its Charge move (see 7.13 LOS).
Disordered cavalry may not Charge. In
order to continue with the Charge,
cavalry must roll for Commitment
[7.41].
The exact sequence is that the cavalry
unit moves and then, if eligible for
Charge, checks for Commitment. If
successful, it then “charge moves” into
the hex and attacks. While the latter
movement is part of the Charge, it is not
part of actual “movement”. Charging
cavalry units become Disordered at the
end of the charge.
7.51 Enemy Obstruction. Cavalry units
that start their activation adjacent to an
enemy combat unit may either stay there
(and change facing), or move away.
They may NOT Charge. Moreover,
cavalry may not voluntarily move
adjacent to an enemy combat unit except
during a Charge. It may do so if required
by a Retreat result [8.3].

Cavalry that are or become adjacent to
an enemy unit being activated may
Withdraw as per 6.34 and 7.53 (they can
Displace other units; see 8.33).
7.52 Terrain Obstruction. Terrain also
determines whether a cavalry unit may
or may not Charge.
• Cavalry may NOT Charge into a nonroad or non-trail Heavily-Cultivated,
Marsh or Woods hex.
• Cavalry MAY Charge into a HeavilyCultivated hex if moving via Road,
but incurs a –1 DRM (in addition to
the DRM the terrain usually brings).
Thus, at Magenta, a cavalry unit in
4609 could charge a unit in 4507 (with
a –1 DRM), but not one in 4408.
• Cavalry may NOT Charge into any
Castle, Town or Village hex regardless
of road presence.
• During charge movement a cavalry
unit may not move through any hex,
or across any hexside (including the
one which separates attacker from
defender) that would cost more than 2
MP.
Historical Note: Normally, we would
exclude charges across fortifications
(which exist at Magenta). However,
most of those fortifications were
“entrenchments,” and the French
cavalry—the Chasseurs of the Guard
— did charge entrenched Austrians at
Magenta.
7.53 Cavalry Reaction. Cavalry has the
ability to avoid—or instigate—an
infantry attack either by moving away at
the first sign of danger, or by charging
into the oncoming units. Whenever an
enemy infantry unit moves into, or starts
its activation adjacent to, a cavalry ZOC,
the “defending” cavalry must do one of
the following:
• React by withdrawing two hexes
away (they can Displace other units;
see 8.33). The enemy may move into
the vacated hex (at least), and then
continue moving if it has MPs
remaining. Horse Artillery (those
batteries with an MA of 8) is
considered to be cavalry for the
purposes of this ability. The choice as
to whether to withdraw or not must be
made the instant the enemy unit enters
the ZOC.

The Second Italian War for Independence________________________________________________________________________
• React by countercharging the
incoming infantry. That combat is
resolved
instantly,
with
the
countercharging cavalry as the attacker
and the attack taking place in the
original target hex. No Commitment
roll is needed.
Design Note: So why can’t the cavalry
just stand and defend? Because, at the
level of complexity and design intent,
the infantry would be firing at the
cavalry, not meleeing. The cavalry
would have only two choices in the
face of that firepower: retreat or
charge. If it stood in place, the
infantry would, most likely, shoot it to
ribbons.
7.54 Reaction Restrictions. Cavalry
may not use Reaction if it is in the ZOC
of a different enemy unit at the time. If
such is the case, it can neither withdraw
nor countercharge. Disordered cavalry
may use reaction to withdraw, but not to
countercharge. Reaction withdrawal does
not cost any MPs. However, the unit
may never react farther than it could
normally move (in terms of MPs it
would spend). It may not react into an
enemy ZOC.
Cavalry may Countercharge only into
hexes into which it could normally
charge [7.52]. If, for reasons of
terrain/ZOC, the cavalry can neither
withdraw nor charge “legally,” it must
stand and defend against the attack.
Example of Cavalry Reaction:
[Solferino] The 3/4 Sicilian Uhlans
are sitting in S3732, guarding the
bridge across the canal. Directly to
their rear (in 3731/3632) are three
battalions of infantry from Dientsl’s
brigade (III) plus an artillery battery.
Two battalions from O’Farrel’s
brigade (IV Corps) move from S3836
to S3832. As they enter S3832, the
Uhlans must decide what to do. To
countercharge would be most foolish
(heavy negative DRMs), so they opt to
withdraw (to 3831). The French
infantry may not move any further. If it
could, it would have been a difficult
decision for the French player, as he
would be moving into the face of an

Austrian battery (and some hefty
opposition).

8.0 COMBAT RESULTS
Combat causes units to suffer Hits [8.1],
Disorder [8.2] and Retreats [8.3].
Disorder can be removed with Rally,
while Hits can be removed with
Recovery [8.5].

8.1 Hits
The term “Hits” is
shorthand for the cumulative and
corrosive effects of combat on a unit. It
represents more than just the loss of
manpower, although that is certainly one
of the aspects. All Hits are cumulative.
Keep track of them by placing the
appropriate Hit markers under the
affected counter.
8.11 Hit Results. Combat results from
either attack or fire may include Hits, the
numbered combat result. Hits are always
applied to the hex as a whole. Thus, if
there are two units in a hex, and it incurs
1 Hit, only one of those units gets that
Hit. If there is a choice as to how to
divide Hits, they must be divided as
evenly as possible, with the affected
player choosing when there is a
“leftover” Hit. Hits have no effect on
Artillery.
8.12 Effect of Hits:
• The number of Hits a unit has
accumulated is used to determine its
Adjusted Cohesion. Unless the rules
say specifically to use the “printed”
Cohesion, whenever a roll is made
against a unit’s Cohesion Rating, the
Cohesion Rating is adjusted (down) by
the number of Hits it has accumulated.
Example: A unit with a Cohesion
Rating of 6 with 2 Hits has an adjusted
Cohesion Rating of 4.
• The instant a unit has accumulated Hits
GREATER THAN its Cohesion
Rating, the unit is eliminated (and is
unrecoverable).
• Hits have no affect on a unit’s basic
ability to fire or attack/defend. It will
affect Commitment, though.

Design Note: It is important to keep in
mind that, as Cohesion Ratings reflect
more than just morale or manpower
casualties. Hits affect the endurance a
unit has. To that extent, the Cohesion
+ Hit system simulates a unit’s staying
power.

8.2 Disorder
Disorder is a result incurred from
Artillery Fire or as a consequence of
performing a charge (cavalry units only).
Indicate such status by flipping the unit
to its Disordered side.
8.21 Disorder Effects. Disordered units
may not Artillery Fire, attack, Charge or
Countercharge. They may fire SmallArms.
A Disordered unit incurs the following
DRMs:
• When defending against attack: –1
• When firing small-arms: –1
8.24 Additional Disorder. If a
Disordered unit suffers an additional
Disorder result, it remains Disordered
and incurs a Hit (in addition to any other
Hits it might have incurred). Artillery
units that suffer an additional Disorder
are eliminated.

8.3 Retreat
Retreat applies only to the aftermath of
an attack; it is not used in fire.
8.31 Determine Loser. After all Hits
have been applied when resolving an
attack, determine the loser of the attack
(which must retreat all his units), using
the following list of priorities (use the
first one that applies):
1) The player whose units received the
most hits must retreat.
2) The player with the unit with the
lowest Adjusted Cohesion (after hits

Copyright © GMT Games, 2000 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Page 17

________________________________________________________________________RISORGIMENTO 1859: THE BATTLES
from that attack have been applied)
must retreat.
3) The side which has a brigadier in the
combat “wins,” forcing the other
side to retreat.
4) The side with the brigadier with the
superior Commitment Rating (–1 is
better than +1) wins, forcing the
other side to retreat.
5) The attacker retreats.
8.32 Attacker Retreat. An attacking
unit must retreat into the hex(es) from
whence it came. It does not move any
further. There are no other restrictions.
8.33 Defender Retreat. A defending
unit forced to retreat moves into any hex
adjacent to the target hex, with the
following “preferences”:
• It may never retreat into an enemyoccupied hex.
• It may not retreat into a hex that was
occupied by an enemy unit prior to the
attack (the attacker’s hex of origin).
• It will retreat into the least costly hex
(in MP cost terms) available.
• It may not retreat into or through
prohibited terrain.
• If it retreats into an enemy ZOC (other
than that exerted form the contested
hex), which it may do, it incurs an
additional Hit.
That is, back-stepping from the
contested hex into the victor’s ZOC
does not trigger the penalty.
Retreating into the ZOC of another
enemy unit does.
• If a unit retreats into a hex occupied by
a friendly unit with which it CAN
stack according to 5.41, and which is
the subject of a pending (yet to be
resolved) attack, it is placed at the
bottom of the stack, and does not
contribute to the hex’s defense in any
way. If the defenders of the hex are
subsequently forced to retreat or are
eliminated, the unit retreats a second
time and performs a CDR. If it fails, it
takes one Hit. The one hit penalty for
retreating into an enemy ZOC still
applies.
• If losing, the defender retreats all his
units from the contested hex before the
attacker retreats any “extra” (i.e.,
overstacked) units of his own. This is
intended to avoid a chance that the
winning, overstacked attackers might

exert a ZOC into a possible retreat
hex, forcing an unwarranted step loss.
• DISPLACEMENT: If a unit’s only
path of retreat is into a hex occupied
by a friendly unit with which it
CANNOT stack per 5.41, it MAY
enter such hex, but:
i) the original occupant unit is
displaced one hex in turn; this
may
trigger
a
chain
of
displacements, which may or may
not extend to the whole line. This
effect is intended.
ii) both units then undergo a CDR. If
either fails, it takes one additional
hit.
iii) If the hex retreated into was
meant to be attacked later in the
same activation by enemy units,
the attack is cancelled. The one
Hit penalty for retreating into an
enemy ZOC still applies.
• An Artillery unit stacked with other
units that are forced to retreat due to
enemy attack is eliminated.
If a defending unit cannot retreat it is
eliminated.
8.34 One-Vertex Facing Change. An
attacking unit can change facing one
vertex in the combat hex after forcing
the defender to retreat.

8.4 Commanders and Combat
Leaders are endangered when one of the
following occurs:
• They are stacked with units that
receive an artillery fire result of D+1.
• They are stacked with units that
receive two or more Hits in an attack.
• They are alone in a hex and an enemy
combat unit moves adjacent.

completing his two activations, the
whole Corps is Finished for the turn –
i.e., no further activations are allowed
until the next turn.
Whenever a leader is alone and an
enemy unit moves adjacent, place his
counter with the nearest combat unit in
his brigade after rolling to see if he is
Finished.
Design Note: The temporary loss of a
leader represents the time needed for
a subordinate to assume command,
without using a new counter.

8.5 Rally and Recovery
Rally applies to removing Disorder.
Recovery is used to reduce the number
of Hits a unit has accumulated.
8.51 Rally. Rally is an action a unit may
undertake when it is activated. If the
designated unit is not adjacent to an
enemy combat unit, and it does nothing
else that activation, the player may
remove the Disorder. Units in an
Extended Activation (4.43) may not
Rally.
8.52 Recovery. In the
Recovery Segment, from
each unit in Reserve status,
a player may:
• Remove Disorder status
AND
• Remove two Hits.
8.53 No Full Recovery. In removing
Hits, a unit may never recover its
original status. The first Hit it receives is
permanent. Anything beyond that first
Hit may be recovered.

When endangered, roll the
die. If it is 7 or higher that
Leader is Finished for the
turn. This means he may
not be used for any of his
game functions until next
turn. For brigadiers, it
means all his units are Out
of Command.
If a Corps
Finished in

Commander becomes
this fashion before

• Add to the roll the number of HDC
brigades.
• Subtract from that roll the Corps
Commander’s
Continuity
Rating
[4.14]. If the adjusted roll is 7 or
higher (the “Demoralization Level”),
that corps is Demoralized.

VITTORIO EMANUELE II

9.0 DEMORALIZATION
Demoralization takes into account the
overall effect of “wear and tear” during a
battle. Combat is hard work, at best. In
the two battles herein, because of the
heat, it was even worse.

9.1 Hors de Combat
A brigade becomes hors
de combat (HDC)—unfit
for battle—when more than one-half of
its units are either Disordered or
Eliminated. HdeC status is determined at
the end of the turn, in the Demoralization
segment. Indicate such with an Hors de
Combat
marker.
Artillery
and
Piedmontese cavalry units have no effect
on HDC status.
9.11 HDC Effects. Units in an HDC
brigade may not attack, nor may they
voluntarily move into an enemy ZOC.
Units may still fire, move, etc.
9.12 Rally and Recovery. Players may
use Recovery and/or Rally to “cure” the
HDC status. When a brigade no longer
qualifies as HDC, remove the marker.

9.2 Corps Demoralization
Demoralization is determined by corps.
In the Demoralization Segment, the
player rolls the die for each corps that
has at least one brigade that is HDC.
Adjust the roll as follows:

Example: Austrian V Corps (2nd
Army) has five brigades; its Corps
Commander, Stadion, has a Cohesion
Rating of 2. Three of its brigades are
HDC. The Austrian player rolls a 7 for
Demoralization: 7 – 2 (Stadion) + 3 (#
of HDC brigades) = 8. That is more
than the Demoralization Level of 7, so
the V Corps is now Demoralized.
9.21 Demoralization Effects. If a corps
has become Demoralized it:
• Must roll for Continuity each time it is
selected for Activation, even for a
usually Free Activation. If it fails the
roll, it is considered to have used up
one of its possible activations for that
turn.
• May not attempt an Extended
Activation.
• Is subject to possible “Corps
Withdrawal” during Rain (see
Solferino scenario rules).
9.22 No Recovery. Once a corps is
Demoralized it remains Demoralized.
Changing the HDC status of its brigades
has no further effect.
Design Note: It is much easier for the
Austrian corps to become demoralized
than the French. This reflects the
rather brittle nature of the Austrian
army. If you feel this makes the game
unbalanced, lower the French
Demoralization Level to 6 or 5 (which
would be rather drastic)

Extra Counters
The backs of a few counters have been
printed with counters not presently used
by the rules. These may be incorporated
in the variant rules in a future article in
C3i magazine.

SOURCES
English
The pickings are slim for this campaign
in English. There are, for the most part,
two readily available sources of
information, although neither is good for
OoB.
Turnbull, Patrick, Solferino (St Martins
Press, NY, 1985). This is a very
general survey approach, but not
entirely worthless. Nice bookcover
picture.
Wylly, H.C., 1859, Magenta and
Solferino. Also a general overview,
but far better than Turnbull’s book.
Maps are okay, and battle details—at
least for a game designer’s purpose—
are more informative.

Non-English
As a result, much research was done in
some period sources in three languages:
German, Italian and French. Most of that
research was done by good friends in
Europe, who provided some of these
citations, and to whom I am most
indebted.

In addition to the above, we had several,
battalion-level tables of “official” Orders
of Battles, in both German and French,
culled from the military archives (by
way of the Library of Congress) by
tireless, fearless, but not overly reckless
co-designer, Peter Perla. Moreover, these
were available for several dates during
the campaign. They were most
informative, to be sure, although
determining which OoB should apply to
when was problematical … and the
German OoB sometimes differed from
the French. So, what else is new?
We were blessed with excellent
European maps on both battles, to which
we added those of the (modern/1969)
Italian Military Geograhical Society (for
which we thank Dave Powell, and to
whom we will send our bill for
eyestrain).
The base maps were from Moltkes
Militarische Werke, III (clear and
concise, but devoid of any vegetation) …
in combination with the maps from the
Italian Official History of the 1859
campaign, which were, at times, tough to
read but, serendipitously did contain
vegetation (of which there was lots) and
unit location, although the exact times
for that information was not provided.
Elevation and vegetation growth was
then correlated with the IGM maps.
There were differences between the
Italian Official History maps and the
Moltke maps, mostly on streams, paths,
villages, etc. The Italian History maps
also differed with the modern maps of
the IGM, especially on terrain elevation
(Cf. a most curious development, there;
for those interested in this sort of thing,
compare the elevations around San
Martino). The Moltke maps appear to
have been drawn at an earlier date, so we
relied mostly, if not entirely, upon them.
The Magenta map was a fairly easy one
to render; Solferino was a nightmare …
as I’m sure it was for the participants.

						               													<description>Risorgimento 1859, the Second Italian War of Independence, covers the second such war, the first, in 1848, having resulted in heavy defeats at the hands of the Austrian/Hapsburg armies. But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat.&amp;#10;Battles and Campaigns&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magenta&amp;#10;A wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solferino&amp;#10;The Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Campaign&amp;#10;Play out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made. This version uses a point-to-point system and some very unusual mechanics to model one of the first military campaigns that used railroads.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TIME SCALE:     1 hour per turn&amp;#10;MAP SCALE:     325 yards per hex&amp;#10;UNIT SCALE:     Battalion &amp;amp; Regimental (battle); Division &amp;amp; Corps (campaign)&amp;#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DESIGNERS Richard Berg (Battle game) and Peter Perla (Campaign game)&amp;#10;DEVELOPERS David Fox, John Alsen, and Richard Berg&amp;#10;ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.
