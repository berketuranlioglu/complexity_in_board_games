Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

1.0 INTRODUCTION

2.3 End of Game Victory

LABYRINTH is a 1-2 player card-driven boardgame simulating at
the strategic level the ongoing bid by Islamic extremists to impose
their brand of religious rule on the Muslim world.
•	 In a 1-player game (9.0), the player portrays the United States
(US) and its allies battling the extremist jihad (“struggle”, i.e.,
holy war).
•	 In a 2-player game, the second player takes on the role of the
Jihadist.
The US side seeks to improve governance in Muslim countries so
that Jihadism is cut off at its roots, or at least to eliminate the extremist fighters that pose the immediate threat. The Jihadist side seeks
to reestablish the Islamic Caliphate of old or to damage the US so
severely that it withdraws from the Muslim world.
In pursuit of these goals in the game, players use strategy cards to
undertake operations or cause events to happen. A hand of cards
in LABYRINTH simulates roughly a year.
Specific game terms found in the glossary on pages 14-15 are
shown in bold the first few times they appear in this rule book. Note
that the game uses the term “Jihadists” to refer to violent Islamic
extremist militants (as Westerners and the militants themselves
commonly do) and not to the world’s many millions of peaceful,
devout Muslims.
The rules are organized into numbered sections. For a 2-player game,
read rules sections 2 through 8. For a 1-player game, also read rules
section 9, “Jihadist Activities”, which modifies the preceding rules
to enable solitaire play.
NOTE: The outside of the Player Aid Cards summarize rules used
in 2-player games, including US and Jihadist Operations (rules 7
and 8) and How to Win (rule 2). The inside of the Player Aid Cards
are used only in 1-player games.

2.0 HOW TO WIN
2.1 Three Ways to Win

Each side can win in three different ways:
2.1.1 US Victory
•	 The US wins the instant that Muslim countries with a total of at
least 12 Resources have Good Governance (4.2.1), OR
•	 at least 15 (of 18) Muslim countries have Fair or Good
Governance, OR
•	 there are no Jihadist cells in any countries on the map.
2.1.2 Jihadist Victory
•	 The Jihadists win the instant Islamist Rule governs countries
totaling at least six Resources that include at least two adjacent
countries, OR
•	 US Prestige is “1” and at least 15 Muslim countries have Poor
or Islamist Rule Governance, OR
•	 a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) Plot (8.5.5-6) is resolved
in the United States without being countered (such as by an Alert,
7.5).

Labyrinth can be played in three different lengths of game. If none
of the conditions of 2.1 have occurred by the selected game-end
reshuffle of the card deck (1st, 2nd, or 3rd -see 3.3, 5.1, &amp; 5.3.1),
the US wins if more than twice as many Resources are under Good
Governance as are under Islamist Rule; otherwise, the Jihadists
win. For this game-end calculation only, count any Regime Change
placed this turn (green marker, 4.8.2) as Islamist Rule.

3.0 SETUP
3.1 In General

Choose a scenario from the back of this rule book. Players should
choose sides and sit side by side, facing the map along its south
edge, with the US player on the left and Jihadist on the right. The
US player takes the “US Operations” player aid sheet and the tan die,
the Jihadist the “Jihadist Operations” sheet and three black dice.
NOTE: You may wish to set up and work through the extended examples in the Playbook before you begin your first game.

3.2 Set Up

Set up markers, troops, and sleeper cells as listed in the scenario.
(Many countries start unmarked until tested during play, 4.9.4.)
•	 Arrange remaining troops (tan cubes) and cells (black cylinders)
on the Troops and Funding tracks, respectively, filling five per
box from right to left (4.7.3-4).
•	 Place three WMD Plot markers in each of the two WMD Plot
holding boxes (4.7.8.1).
•	 Place the “Card” marker on the Action Phase track at Jihadist
Card 1 (4.7.5). Set both Reserves to “0” (6.3.3).
•	 Place the numbered Plot markers face down in the Available Plots
box (4.7.8). Place spare Regime Change, Aid/Besieged Regime,
cadre, event, and 1st Plot markers aside.
•	 Remove any cards that are specified by the scenario, then shuffle
the remainder to create a face-down Draw Deck. Place it near the
map with room for a Discard Pile next to it.
•	 Deal players the numbers of cards indicated by the Troops and
Funding tracks, respectively (5.2.8), and begin play with the
Jihadist Action Phase (see Sequence of Play, 5.0).
NOTE: By mutual agreement players may use spare markers to
alter beginning Muslim or non-Muslim governance or posture as
they deem historical.

3.3 Select Length of Play

Players select one of the three game lengths below. Selection is
entirely up to the players:
•	 STANDARD: Place the “Deck” marker on the Reshuffle track at
1 Deck—end play (2.3) when a card is to be drawn but the deck
is exhausted.
•	 TOURNAMENT FINAL: Place the “Deck” marker at 2 Decks—
end play upon the 2nd reshuffle (5.3.1).
•	 CAMPAIGN: Place the “Deck” marker at 3 Decks—end play
upon the 3rd reshuffle.

2.2 Oil Price Spike

In the unlikely event that play of an Oil Price Spike event causes
both sides to achieve their victory conditions simultaneously, the
side that played the event wins.

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

4.0 COMPONENTS

A complete set of LABYRINTH includes:
•	 One 22” by 34” mounted map
•	 One sheet of 156 counters
•	 This Rule book
•	 A Playbook
•	 A US foldout player aid sheet
•	 A Jihadist foldout player aid sheet
•	 120 cards
•	 15 tan wooden cubes (to keep record of troops)
•	 15 black wooden cylinders (to keep track of terrorist cells)
•	 Four 6-sided dice (1 tan, three black)

4.1 THE MAP

4.1.1 Countries and Connection Lines. The map shows most
of the Muslim world, plus several other regions where extremists
might operate. Each space on the map represents a country or block
of countries. Spaces differ, depending on the country’s dominant
religion. Country spaces connected by lines are adjacent. Adjacency
affects cell Travel (8.3), US War of Ideas (7.2), Jihadist Victory
(2.1), and some events (see also 4.5).
Oil Exporter
(4.2.6)
Religion
(4.1.2)



of four ratings: Good (best), Fair, Poor, and Islamist Rule (worst).
Good, Fair, and Poor Governance have associated values (1, 2, and
3, respectively) that affect a variety of game functions, particularly
operations in the country.
Governance markers

4.2.2 Denote a country’s Governance with the appropriate marker,
flipping or replacing the marker as Governance improves or worsens.
EXAMPLE: If the Governance of Saudi Arabia improves one
level from Poor to Fair, replace the country’s “Poor-3” marker
with a “Fair-2” in the same Alignment box. If it improves again,
flip “Fair-2” to “Good-1.”
4.2.3 Alignment. A three-space track in each Muslim country space
depicts the country’s Alignment with respect to the US-either Ally,
Neutral, or Adversary.
NOTE: Only Muslim countries are rated for Alignment. Thus, in
game terms, a Non-Muslim country is never an “Ally”. Non-Muslim
countries instead are rated for their “Posture” (4.3.2)
4.2.4 Place a country’s Governance marker in the appropriate box
of the country’s Alignment track.
EXAMPLE: Saudi Arabia sets up as a US Ally with Poor Governance (“Poor Ally”).

Alignment
Track (4.2.3)

Area for
cells, troops,
and markers

NOTE: The first time a country’s Governance is tested, its Alignment
typically is Neutral (4.9.4)

4.1.2 Religion. All countries are marked for their degree and nature
of Muslim affiliation. Sunni and Shia-Mix countries together are
called “Muslim” in the game (4.2). Non-Muslim countries are those
in which Muslims are in the minority (4.3). Shia-dominated Iran is
a separate type of country (in game terms, neither “Shia-Mix” nor
“Muslim”, 4.4).

	

Sunni

Shia-Mix

(special case)

Non-Muslim

DESIGN NOTE: “Shia-Mix” countries include several ruled by
Sunnis or other non-Shia but with substantial or particularly active
Shia populations.

4.2 Muslim Countries

4.2.1 Governance. Muslim countries are marked for the quality of
their Governance which is established at set-up and can change during the course of the game. Governance in game terms is depicted
by a descending scale (in terms of effectiveness and accountability)

4.2.5 Resources. Each Muslim country shows
a Resource value of 1, 2, or 3. Governance
over Resources in part determines victory.
Resources also affect a few events.
4.2.6 Oil. Some Muslim countries show an Oil Exporter
symbol next to their Resource value. Each of these countries’ Resource value is one higher for each Oil Price
Spike event in play.

4.3 Non-Muslim Countries

4.3.1 Governance. Non-Muslim countries show permanent Governance of either Good-1 or Fair-2.
NOTE: Governance in Non-Muslim countries never changes but
still affects play.
4.3.2 Posture. Non-Muslim countries (except
the United States and Iran) have marker
boxes for Posture, representing their reigning
political preference for the use of either “Hard
power” or “Soft power” in the struggle against extremism. Scenarios
explain how to mark each Non-Muslim country’s Posture with the



Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

appropriate marker. The United States also has a Posture—mark it
on the GWOT Relations Track (4.7.2).
Front

Back

4.3.3 Israel. Israel’s posture is always “Hard”, as indicated by its
map space Posture box.
4.3.4 Recruitment. A few non-Muslim countries show Recruit
Numbers that set the ability of Jihadists to add people to their cause
in that country (8.2.4). (EXAMPLE: Philippines has a Recruit
Number of “REC 3”.)

4.4 Iran

IRAN is a special type of country (in game terms, neither “Muslim”
nor “non-Muslim”). It has unchanging Governance like a non-Muslim country but no Posture.

4.5 Schengen Countries

A country connected to a Schengen symbol is adjacent
to all Schengen countries, and all Schengen countries are
adjacent to one another. (Thus, when a cell moves to a
Schengen connection symbol, the Jihadist side may place
that cell into any of the seven “SCHENGEN” country spaces that
make up the Schengen area.)

4.7 TRACKS AND BOXES

Several tracks and holding boxes regulate play. The tracks do limit
game values. (EXAMPLE: Jihadist Funding never falls below 1 or
exceeds 9; World Posture never exceeds Soft 3 or Hard 3.) Tracks
and boxes and their uses include:
4.7.1 US Prestige Track. As Prestige changes, move
the “US Prestige” marker between 1 and 12 to indicate
corresponding Low, Medium, High, or Very High
Prestige. Prestige can change for a variety of reasons
(see Playbook for a summary). If a Prestige Roll is required, first
roll to determine whether it will shift up or down (see the “Prestige”
table on the Player Aid Card). Then roll two dice and shift Prestige
by the lower roll.
DESIGN NOTE: Prestige represents the world’s (especially Muslims’) overall affinity toward the United States, which affects US
War of Ideas operations (4.9.2, 7.2.1) and some events.
4.7.2 US GWOT (Global War on Terror) Relations Track.
Determine World Posture by separately counting non-US Soft
and Hard Posture markers on the map (always count Israel as
holding a Hard marker) and subtracting the lower from the higher
total for the value, with the higher total determining the side of
the scale used. As Postures change, move (and flip) the “World
Hard/Soft” marker along the Soft 3 to Hard 3 Posture scale and
the “US Hard/Soft” marker between Soft and Hard.

4.6 Cells and Troops

4.6.1 Each of the 15 black cylinders in the game represents a cell
of Jihadist plotters or fighters. Each of the 15 tan cubes represents
a major unit of Western troops.
Cells
Troops

4.6.2 Cells and troops set up on respective tracks that serve as holding
boxes for the cylinders and cubes when not in a country (4.7.3-4).
Each country space has an area for any cells or troops there.
4.6.3 The cylinders and cubes in the game are a limit on cells and
troops that can be in play.
EXAMPLE: The Jihadist may not place any cells via events or recruiting if 15 are already in countries, leaving none on the Funding
Track (4.7.4.).
4.6.4 Sleeper and Active Cells. Cells are either Sleeper or Active.
(Place Sleeper cells crescent side down, Active cells crescent side
up.) Cells are Sleeper or Active according to the following:
•	 Cells placed from the Funding Track (4.7.4) onto the map begin
as Sleepers.
•	 Sleeper cells used for Jihad (8.4) or Plot (8.5.1), that are
Disrupted (7.4), or that are in a country at the moment of a
Regime Change Deployment there (7.3.4) go Active.
•	 Active cells that Travel (either between or within countries, 8.3.1)
become Sleepers.

EXAMPLE: Three non-US countries at Soft and five at Hard would
yield a World Posture of Hard 2.
NOTE: Because US Posture is marked on the GWOT Relations
track, the US space unlike other non-Muslim countries does not
have a Posture box.
4.7.2.1 GWOT Relations Penalty. If World and US Postures are
different (one Hard, one Soft), the GWOT Relations Penalty equals
the World Posture value (either “1”, “2”, or “3”); if Postures are the
same (both Hard or both Soft) or World Posture is “0”, the Penalty
is 0.
DESIGN NOTE: GWOT Relations represent non-Muslim unity or
discord over tactics against extremism, affecting US War of Ideas
operations (4.9.2 &amp; 7.2), Prestige (5.2.5), and some events.
4.7.3 Troops Track. Place any troops not in countries onto the
Troops Track, five cubes per box, filling boxes from the right toward
the left. Whenever troops Deploy from the track to countries, draw
cubes from the left toward the right. Place and move the “Troops”
marker into the right-most box with fewer than five troop cubes.

Governance and Islamist Rule (2.1, 4.2.1, 4.2.5) and the numbers
of countries at either Fair or Good and at either Poor or Islamist
Rule.
4.7.7 Event Box. Place markers for Lingering events in effect (6.2.7)
in the Event Box.
Event Markers
EXAMPLE: If seven of the 15 troop cubes were deployed in various
countries, the eight remaining troop cubes would be on the Troops
track—five cubes in the “Overstretch” box and three cubes in the
“War” box. The “Troops” marker would be in the “War” box with
the three cubes, indicating that the US was at War rather than at
Low Intensity or Overstretch.
DESIGN NOTE: The level of troop commitment influences other
resources available for the struggle with extremism. In the game,
that level influences US hand draw size (5.2.8) and some events.
4.7.4 Jihadist Funding Track. When cells are Recruited or placed
by event into a country, draw them from the Funding Track, starting
from the left and working toward the right. When cells are removed
from countries, place them onto the Funding track, five cubes per
box, filling boxes from the right toward the left.
4.7.4.1 Funding. As Funding changes, move the “Jihadist Funding”
marker between 1 and 9 to indicate corresponding Tight, Moderate,
or Ample Funding.
DESIGN NOTE: Funding represents the rate of financial contributions to extremist organizations from religious donors and other
sources. It affects Jihadist recruitment and hand draw size.
4.7.4.2 Available Cells. Only cells in a box below or to the left of the
“Jihadist Funding” marker are Available to be Recruited (8.2.1).

PLAY NOTE: Many events affect a single country only, and players may wish for convenience to place such event markers in that
country’s space instead of the Event Box. Similarly, some event
markers have marker holding boxes near the multiple countries
they affect.
4.7.7.1 Lapsing Event Boxes. When a LAPSING event occurs
(6.2.7), place its card in a Lapsing Event box (if more than two
LAPSING events are in play, double up or use their markers).
4.7.7.2 1st Plot Box. When the Jihadist side conducts its first Plot
operation of a turn (8.5.3), place the card used into the 1st Plot box
(as a reminder that subsequent cards for Plot operations trigger US
events normally, 6.3.2 ).
4.7.7.3 If a LAPSING or 1st Plot card is removed from a box
before the end of a Turn (Example: Oil Price Spike or a mid-Turn
reshuffle), replace it with the event’s marker or the “1st Plot” marker,
respectively.
4.7.8 Available Plots. Place Available Plot markers (4.8.1, 7.5.3,
8.5.2, 8.5.4) in the Available Plots box-any Plot markers in this box
are Available to be placed into countries via Plot operations (8.5.2)
or events.
4.7.8.1 WMD Plot Boxes. Keep WMD Plot markers that are not yet
Available (8.5.5) in the “Loose Nuke, HEU, &amp; Kazakh Strain” and
“Pakistan Arsenal” holding boxes, three markers per box.

EXAMPLE: Funding is currently 6, and only three of 15 cells are
active in various countries. The “Ample” box holds five unrecruited
cells, the “Moderate” box another five, and the “Tight” box the remaining two. The seven cells in the “Tight” and “Moderate” boxes
are Available and could be Recruited; the five in the “Ample” box
are not. The first cells to be Recruited or placed into countries by
events would come from the “Tight” box.
Unless otherwise specified, Funding affects cell placement only for
Recruit operations. Event-driven placement occurs so long as cells
remain on the Funding Track. Also, drops in Funding do not affect
cells already present in countries.
4.7.5 Play Sequence Tracks. Move the “Card” marker along the
Action Phases track as players play cards (5.2.2, 6.0). After each US
Action Phase is completed and any Plots resolved, return the “Card”
marker to the Jihadist “Card 1” space. Move the “Deck” marker one
box to the right as each Reshuffle occurs (5.3.1).
4.7.6 Victory Tracks. Move the “Good Resources”, “Islamist
Resources”, “Fair/Good”, and “Poor/Islamist” markers along the
Victory track to record the respective Resource totals under Good

•	 WMD Events: When an event makes a WMD Plot marker
Available, place a marker from the “Loose Nuke, HEU, &amp; Kazakh
Strain” box into the Available Plots box, face down.
•	 Pakistan: When PAKISTAN first comes under Islamist Rule
(8.4.5), place the three WMD Plot markers from the “Pakistan
Arsenal” box into the Available Plots box, face down.
NOTE: WMD Plot markers never return to the WMD or Available
Plots boxes—once used in a Plot (8.5), they are removed from
play.
4.7.9 Reserves Tracks. Each side records
Reserves (6.3.3) on a Reserves Track. At the
end of each turn, reset all Reserves to “0”.



Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

4.8 OTHER MARKERS

4.8.1 Plot Markers. Six non-WMD Plot markers are numbered
either “1”, “2”, or “3”. Keep them face down in the Available Plots
box (4.7.8)—only the Jihadist side may inspect them (8.5.4). They
may be reused. Higher value plots require higher-value operations
cards to place.
Alert to remove

(7.5.1)

4.8.2 Regime Change Markers. Keep Regime Change markers near
the map. When a Regime Change operation occurs (7.3.4), place a
green Regime Change marker on top of the troop cubes to indicate
that they may not Deploy out of the country (7.3.1). After dealing
new card hands (5.2.8), flip any green Regime Change markers to
tan (5.2.9). Any country containing a Regime Change marker is a
“Regime Change country” (7.3.4.1).
Clarification: “Withdrawal” (7.3.5) is another means by which the
restriction on troop deployment from a Regime Change country is
lifted.
NOTE: Via 2.3, green Regime Change markers prevent an easy
last-turn reversal of Islamist victory. If the current turn is unlikely
to be the last (3.3) and you wish to avoid the step of flipping the
marker (5.2.9), place it tan side up.

4.9.4 Initial Tests. Roll for Governance (if a Muslim country)
or Posture (if a non-Muslim country) whenever a country whose
Governance or Posture is not yet marked (an “unmarked” country)
is selected as:
•	 the locale or target of an operation (including a failed Travel
operation, 8.3.2), or
•	 has a cell or plot placed in it by an event, or
•	 is subject to “test” by event text.
An Initial Test of Governance always results in an Alignment of Neutral. (A Regime Change Governance roll results in an Ally, 7.3.4.)
Important: Event instructions to “test” a country have no effect if
the country is already marked with a Governance level or Posture.
Also, note that “test” (roll only if unmarked) is different than “select” (player’s choice and a marked or unmarked country may be
selected).
4.9.5 Mandatory Follow Through. The side triggering a test must
carry out the action regardless of the outcome of the test. If the US
side attempts a War of Ideas operation in a Muslim country with a
card of insufficient value for the Governance resulting from a test
(7.1, 7.2.1), the War of Ideas operation automatically fails.
EXAMPLE: The Jihadist side attempts to Travel (8.3) a cell from
Iraq to Sudan when Sudan is unmarked. The triggered Initial Test
roll of “5” marks Sudan as a Fair Neutral. The Jihadist side must
roll Travel: a roll of “2” or less would place the cell in Sudan; a roll
of “3” or higher would remove it to the Funding Track.
4.9.6 Jihadist Activities. A separate Jihadist Activities sheet (on the
inside of both Player Aid Cards) is used only in a 1-player game, to
help determine how and where Jihadists operate (9.4).

green

4.8.3 Aid/Besieged Regime Markers. Keep
Aid/Besieged Regime markers near the map.
Use them to mark countries strengthened by
War of Ideas (7.2.2.1) or weakened by Jihad
(8.4.3.1). They affect War of Ideas Table rolls (7.2.3) and Major
Jihad success (8.4.3.2), respectively.
4.8.4 Cadre Markers. Keep cadre markers near the
map. Whenever the last cell in a country without a
cadre is removed by Disrupt (7.4) or event (not Jihad
or Travel, 8.3-8.4), place a cadre there. Cadres enable
Recruiting (8.2.2). Whenever a cell is placed from the Funding track
into a country with a cadre, remove the cadre. The Jihadist player
may remove any cadres during any Jihadist Action Phase.

4.10 CARDS

4.10.1 Each of the game’s 120 cards has an operations value; a symbol if its event is associated with a side; an event name; flavor text;
game text (often with a precondition, 6.2.6); and an event number.
Some cards show that they are used only in scenarios that begin in
certain years. Some show that the events have markers for lingering or lapsing effects (6.2.7) or that the event occurs only once and
then is removed (6.2.9). The US Election card is an automatically
triggered event (6.3.1).
Scenarios used
Jihadist-associated (4.10.4)
Operations value (6.3)
Flavor text (4.10.2)

4.9 TABLES

4.9.1 The outside of the player aid sheet has several die-roll tables
used in the game: the “Governance”, “Posture”, “Prestige”, and
“War of Ideas” tables.
4.9.2 War of Ideas Table. When the US side conducts a War of Ideas
operation in a Muslim country (7.2.1), it must roll a 5 or more to
succeed. Refer to the War of Ideas Table (on both Player Aid Cards)
for modifiers to the roll. (War of Ideas in non-Muslim countries
instead uses the Posture table, 4.9.3 &amp; 7.2.3).
4.9.3 Country Tables. Whenever rolling a country’s Governance
(4.2.1-2) or Posture (4.3.2) or US Prestige (4.7.1), refer to the correspondingly named table (found on both Player Aid Cards).
EXAMPLE: Event text “Roll US Posture” causes a roll on the Posture table. Modify the die roll by +1 if rolling for US’s Posture.

the Discard Pile and set any markers there aside. All Lapsing event
effects end at this moment.
5.2.7 Reserves. Then, set all Reserves to “0” (6.3.3.1).

Jihadist-associated

Unassociated

5.2.8 Deal. Next, deal the Jihadist and the US sides alternate cards,
up to the numbers indicated by the Funding and Troops tracks, and
begin a new Turn. (Deal the indicated number of cards to the US
player regardless of whether the player is holding a final card per
5.2.4. There is no maximum hand size.) 		
5.2.9 Flip Regime Change. Finally, flip any green Regime Change
markers to their tan side (4.8.2).

5.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

5.3 DRAW AND DISCARD PILES

5.1 IN GENERAL

LABYRINTH continues until the instant that one side achieves one of
its victory conditions (2.1) or the instant of the Reshuffle (1st, 2nd,
or 3rd) that corresponds to the selected length of play (3.3).

5.2 TURNS

5.2.1 In General. Play proceeds through a series of Turns comprising alternating Action Phases. A Turn ends and a new Turn begins
when each side has expended the cards it was dealt, or when the
Jihadists have expended their cards and the US player then opts to
hold a card (5.2.4). Each Turn follows this sequence:
5.2.2 Action Phases. In the first Action Phase, the Jihadist side plays
two cards in succession from its hand. Then the US side does the
same during its Action Phase, then the Jihadists, and so on. Place
played cards in the Discard Pile. (EXCEPTION: LAPSING or 1st
Plot, 4.7.7.1-2; REMOVE, 6.2.9.) A side with no cards remaining
during its Action Phase does nothing (the Jihadist side may remove
cadres, 4.8.4). In its action phase, the US side may discard or hold
the last card remaining in its hand (5.2.4).
NOTE: The card text “last Action Phase” during the US phase
refers to the preceding Jihadist phase, and vice versa, even if in
the previous Turn.
5.2.2.1 As each card is played, it must be used to carry out either its
event (6.2) or operations (6.3).
5.2.2.2 Mark the play of cards on the Action Phase track.
5.2.3 Unblocked Plots. At the end of each US Action Phase (whether
or not the US played any cards), resolve all Plots in any countries
(8.5.6).
5.2.4 Final US Card. In any US Action Phase that the US side is
holding only one card, it may play it, discard it (without effect), or
hold it. If the Jihadist side has expended its cards and the US side
holds its final card, resolve any plots and end the turn.
5.2.5 Expenditures &amp; Diplomacy. At the end of each turn, drop
Funding by one (shift the “Jihadist Funding” marker one box
leftward on the Funding Track). Drop Prestige by one (shift the
“Prestige” marker leftward) if any country is under Islamist Rule.
Then, if Net World Posture is “3” and the same as US Posture, add
+1 Prestige (rightward).
NOTE: Remember that a marker on a track may never fall below
the lowest value on the track or exceed the highest value on the
track. For example, if US Prestige is at “1” and is subject to a –1,
it would remain “1”. Prestige of “1” subject to –1 and then +1 for
Diplomacy would result in Prestige of “2”.

5.3.1 Whenever a card is to be drawn but the Draw Deck is exhausted, reshuffle the cards in the Discard Pile and Lapsing and 1st
Plot boxes (4.7.7.1-2) to create a new Draw Deck and advance the
“Deck” marker one box to the right. If it is the game-end reshuffle
(3.3, 5.1), the game immediately ends: determine victory (2.3).
5.3.2 Discarded and removed cards, cards in boxes, and the numbers of cards in each side’s hand and in the Draw Deck are open
to inspection.

6.0 CARD PLAY
6.1 IN GENERAL

Cards may be played in one of two ways: as events or operations.

6.2 PLAYING CARDS AS EVENTS

6.2.1 When a side elects to play a card for the event, the operations
value of the card is ignored (unless otherwise specified by the event
itself), and the side immediately implements the event according to
the game text on the card.
6.2.2 Whenever event text conflicts with game rules, the event
governs: follow the event text instead of any conflicting rules while
implementing the event and, if lingering (6.2.7), as long as the event
remains in effect (not blocked or lapsed).
EXAMPLE: Play of the UN Nation Building event could allow a
War of Ideas roll in a Regime Change country, even if troops did
not exceed cells by five, because the card text “Play if a country is
marked with Regime Change…roll a War of Ideas…” trumps the
restrictions in rule 7.2.1.

6.2.3 Conflicts. Should one event’s text conflict with another, the
last-played event supersedes for as long as it remains in effect.
6.2.4 When an event occurs, implement whatever aspects apply,
including MARK (6.2.7) and REMOVE (6.2.9), even if other
aspects do not.
EXAMPLE: US play of the Ansar Al-Islam card for operations triggers the event (6.3.2), but there are no cells on the Funding Track.
No cell is placed (4.6.2 &amp; 4.7.4), but the card is removed from the
game (6.2.9).

6.2.5 Associated. A card with an event associated with a side may
be played for its event only by that side (either side may play the
card for operations, 6.3.1-2.).
6.2.6 Playable. Many cards have events with preconditions for play
(in gray text): if the preconditions are not met, these cards cannot
be played as events (only for operations). Similarly, blocked events
are not playable (6.2.8).



Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

6.2.7 Lingering and Lapsing.
•	 Lingering: A card that says MARK has an event with lingering
effects. When playing such an event, place its marker into the
Event Box or at the appropriate country space as a reminder
(4.7.7).
•	 Lapsing: An event that says LAPSING has effects that linger only
for the remainder of the Turn. When playing the event, place the
card in a LAPSING card holding box as a reminder (4.7.7.1).

7.0 US OPERATIONS

6.2.8 Blocking. Certain events block other events: a card with a
blocked event can be played only for operations; the effects of a
lingering event (6.2.7) end (flip or remove its marker) if a new event
is played that blocks it.

•	
•	
•	
•	

NOTE: The markers of lingering events that block other events list
the blocked events in brackets (see illustration 4.7.7).
6.2.9 One-Time Events. The event of a card that says REMOVE can
occur only once per game. When played as an event (only—NOT
when the card is used for operations or discarded!), permanently
remove it from play.

Each US card play for operations conducts a single operation
(EXCEPTION: Reassessment, 7.6.2). The US player aid sheet summarizes this section.

7.1 IN GENERAL

7.1.1 Operations Value Requirement. The operations value required depends on Governance in the target country:
Good: 1 or higher (i.e., any card—1, 2, or 3)
Fair: 2 or higher (i.e., a 2- or 3-value card)
Poor: 3 only
Islamist Rule: Regime Change only (using a 3-card, 7.1.3 &amp;
7.3.4).

EXCEPTION: Alert always costs a 3-value card (7.5.1)
EXAMPLE: The US player wishes to conduct War of Ideas in the
Gulf States to improve Governance there. Governance there currently is “Fair-2”, so the US player will have to play either a 2- or
3-value card to carry out the operation.

6.3.2 Triggering the Other Side’s Events. Play of a card for operations that has an event associated with the opposing side immediately
causes the event to occur. EXCEPTION: The first Jihadist card used
for Plot operations each turn does not trigger any US event, 8.5.3.

7.1.2 US Options. Beyond Reserves (6.3.3), the US operations
options are:
•	 War of Ideas to improve alignment or governance or alter posture
to boost world relations and prestige.
•	 Deploy troops to a country, possibly to change a regime (or bring
them home to the Troops track).
•	 Disrupt Jihadist cells or cadre (and raise US prestige).
•	 Alert to thwart or mitigate a terrorist plot.
•	 Reassessment of US Posture.

6.3.2.1 The side playing the triggering card chooses whether the
event or the operation(s) occurs first. If—at the moment that the
event is to occur—the event is blocked or has a precondition that is
not met (6.2.6), the event does not occur.

7.1.3 US Operations in an Islamist Country: The only US operation allowed in an Islamist Rule country is a special form of Deploy
called Regime Change (7.3.4).

6.3.2.2 Implement the event as if the side that it is associated with
played it, with the associated player making any decisions involved.
MARK (6.2.7) or REMOVE (6.2.9) normally.

7.2 WAR OF IDEAS

Unlike other US operations, War of Ideas requires a die roll for
success. War of Ideas operations targeting Muslim countries (7.2.1)
use the War of Ideas table (4.9.2) and die roll modifiers found there,
while those targeting non-Muslim countries (7.2.3) use the Posture
table (4.9.3).

6.3 PLAYING CARDS FOR OPERATIONS

6.3.1 A side can play a card for its operations value regardless of
the event or association on it. The player selects a type of operation
and uses the value of the card to implement it (7.0 or 8.0). EXCEPTION: Play of US Election always triggers the event; the playing
side chooses whether the operations or the event occur first.

6.3.2.3 Use of a card with a friendly or unassociated event for
operations—or discard of any card—does not trigger the event
(EXCEPTION: US Election).
6.3.3 Reserves. Both sides may play 1- or 2-value cards for Reserves
operations. A Reserves operation adds the card’s value to that side’s
Reserves Track, to a maximum of “2”. If the card has a playable
event associated with the opposing side, the event immediately
occurs (6.3.2).
6.3.3.1 A side may expend all its Reserves (back to “0”) to add that
value (1 or 2) to a card it plays that turn for other operations (only,
not for events such as Back Channel), to a maximum card value of
“3”. EXCEPTION: The US may not use Reserves for Reassessment (7.6).
EXAMPLE: The US side has two Reserves and wishes to Alert a
Plot, which requires a 3-value card play (7.5.1). By expending all
Reserves, the US may play a 1- or 2-value card as though it were a
3-value card (Reserves bring a card’s value up to a maximum of 3)
to perform the Alert Operation.
6.3.3.2 Reserves not expended by the end of the turn are lost
(5.2.7).

7.2.1 War of Ideas in a Muslim Country
7.2.1.1 A War of Ideas operation in a Muslim country allows the
US side to roll once on the War of Ideas Table to improve a Neutral
or untested country’s Alignment or an Ally country’s Governance.
The target Muslim country may not be an Adversary. A successful
roll shifts a Neutral country to Ally (4.2.3) or improves an Ally
country’s Governance by one level—from Poor to Fair or from Fair
to Good (4.2.1-2).
NOTE: A shift to Good removes any Regime Change, Besieged
Regime, or Aid markers.
7.2.1.2 Procedure: Roll one 6-sided die. A modified roll of “5” or
more is needed to succeed. Modifiers depend on whether attempting
a shift from Fair to Good, Prestige, GWOT Relations, Aid markers,
and any adjacent Good Ally. (See 4.9.2 and the War of Ideas Table
on both Player Aid Cards. Note that negative modifiers may make
success impossible.)
7.2.1.3 Regime Change. War of Ideas may occur in a country marked
with Regime Change (7.3.4, 7.3.4.1) only if the number of troops
there exceeds the number of cells by at least five.

© 2010 &amp; 2011 GMT Games, LCC

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition
7.2.2 Aid Markers
7.2.2.1 The First Aid Marker. When making a War of
Ideas die roll in a Muslim Country, if the success die roll
fails by one pip (examples: a roll of “4” when 5+ was
needed for success, or a roll of “6” when a theoretical
7+ was needed) in a country without Aid, then place an Aid marker
there. (Events also may place the first Aid marker in a country.)
7.2.2.2 Additional Aid Markers. War of Ideas can place only the
first Aid marker in a country—only events can add additional Aid.
Aid markers accumulate until removed.
7.2.2.3 Removal of Aid Markers. A shift to Good Governance or
Islamist Rule removes all Aid from a country. A successful Jihad or
Plot resolution roll removes one Aid (8.4.1-2, 8.5.6).
7.2.3 War of Ideas in a Non-Muslim Country
A War of Ideas operation in a Non-Muslim country other than the
United States or Israel allows the US side to roll once on the Posture
table to determine (or change) the country’s Posture (4.3.2, 4.9.3-4).
(Make one roll, whether or not Posture has already been marked.) A
roll of 1-4 results in Soft Posture, 5-6 in Hard. If a target country’s
Posture after a War of Ideas operation is the same as that of the US,
add +1 to Prestige.



7.3.4.1 Regime Change Countries. Any country with a Regime
Change marker is a “Regime Change country.” Only Poor or Fair
countries can be Regime Change countries. Immediately remove any
Regime Change marker from a country whose Governance shifts to
either Good or Islamist Rule.
7.3.5 Withdraw. Withdraw is a second special type of Deploy operation. It requires the US to be at Soft Posture and to have troops in a
Regime Change country (7.3.4.1). Play a 3-value card (may include
Reserves, 6.3.3.1) and:
•	 Deploy any number troops out of the Regime Change country
(regardless of cells present).
•	 Remove any Aid markers there.
•	 Place a Besieged Regime marker there (if there is not one
already).
•	 Roll Prestige.
NOTE: The Regime Change marker remains.

7.4 DISRUPT

7.3 DEPLOY

Disrupt operations allow the US side to:
•	 Remove Active cells.
•	 Make Sleeper cells Active.
•	 Remove cadre.

EXCEPTION: Troops may not Deploy from a Regime Change
country (7.3.4.1) if it would leave fewer than five more troops there
than cells (see also Withdraw, 7.3.5).

7.4.1 A Disrupt operation requires a target country that has at least
one cell or cadre in it and:
•	 Is an Ally, or
•	 Has at least two troops in it, or
•	 Is non-Muslim (not IRAN).

7.3.1 A Deploy operation allows the US side to move any number
of troops from any one location (including the Troops Track) to
another.

DESIGN NOTE: Troops in Regime Change countries are participating in reconstruction and securing the new government against enemies beyond the Jihadists, such as secular insurgents or bandits.
7.3.2 The Governance of the destination country determines the
minimum operations value needed. Use any card to Deploy to the
Troops Track (i.e., treat the Troops Track as “Good-1”).
7.3.3 A destination country at the moment of the Deploy operation
must be an Ally and thus must be a Muslim country (Exception:
Regime Change, 7.3.4).
7.3.4 Regime Change. Regime Change is a special type of Deploy
operation. It requires the US to be at Hard Posture and have at least
six troops able to Deploy (from a single location and not committed
to other Regime Change countries per 7.3.1). The destination must
be a country under Islamist Rule (unlike normal Deploy per 7.3.3,
the country need not be an Ally). Play a 3-value card (may include
Reserves, 6.3.3.1) and:
•	 Deploy at least six troops into the country.
•	 Place a green Regime Change marker on them (4.8.2).
•	 Roll its Governance on the Country Tests table.
•	 Shift its Alignment to Ally.
•	 Shift any Sleeper cells there to Active (4.7.4.1).
•	 Roll Prestige
NOTE: The Regime Change marker on the
troops acts as a reminder that some or all
may not Deploy out (7.3.1) unless Withdrawing (7.3.5).

7.4.2 A Disrupt operation in a country with at least two troops or
whose Posture is Hard affects two cells selected by the US side.
Otherwise, it affects one US-selected cell. Disrupt of an Active
cell removes it to the Funding Track. Disrupt of a Sleeper cell shifts
it to Active. Alternatively, if there are no cells present, Disrupt
removes a cadre.
NOTE: A single Disrupt of two cells—one Active, one Sleeper—
would remove the first and make the second Active. A single Disrupt
operation could NOT first make Active and then remove a single
Sleeper cell, nor could it remove both cells and cadre.
7.4.3 If a Disrupt operation removes the last cell in a country, place
a cadre marker (4.8.4).
7.4.4 If a Disrupt operation occurs in a country with at least two
troops, raise Prestige by +1 (even if it only shifted cells to Active
or removed a cadre).

7.5 ALERT

7.5.1 An Alert operation requires a 3-value card, regardless of Governance (may include Reserves, 6.3.3.1).
7.5.2 An Alert operation allows the US side to select, reveal, and
block (remove) one Plot marker from any country (including an
Adversary or IRAN).
7.5.3 The US player may inspect the Plot marker only after selecting
it (8.5.4). If a WMD Plot, remove it from the game (8.5.5); otherwise,
return it face down to the Available Plots box.
NOTE: All unblocked Plots are resolved at the end of each US Action
Phase (5.2.3), so there is a limited window for Alert.

10

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

7.6 REASSESSMENT

7.6.1 A Reassessment operation allows the US side to change US
Posture from Hard to Soft or Soft to Hard.
7.6.2 Unlike other US operations, a Reassessment requires play
of two cards, each of 3 value (no Reserves, 6.3.3.1), taking up an
entire US Action Phase.
7.6.3 The US player decides what order the Posture switch and any
triggered Jihadist events occur (6.3.2). The posture switch must be
carried out.
NOTE: Certain events or resolution of a plot in the United States
(8.5.6) also can change US Posture.
Clarification: The Posture switch must be carried out.

8.1.3 Jihadist Options
Beyond Reserves (6.3.3), the Jihadist operations options are:
•	 Recruit to raise new cells in countries.
•	 Travel cells between countries, or within a country to go to ground
(sleep).
•	 Jihad (guerrilla warfare) to strike at Governance and foment
Islamist revolution.
•	 Plot terror attacks to increase funding, harm US prestige, provoke
security reactions that worsen Governance, cancel aid programs,
alter a country’s Posture to disorder the West’s relations, or devastate the US Homeland.

8.2 RECRUIT

8.0 JIHADIST OPERATIONS

8.2.1 For each successful roll, a Recruit operation places one Available Sleeper cell into a country. (“Available” means that the cell must
be taken from a box on the Funding Track below or to the left of the
Funding marker, 4.7.4.2.) A failed Recruit roll has no effect.

8.1 IN GENERAL

8.2.2 The country must already have a cell or cadre present. If a cadre
is present, it is removed as soon as the first cell is placed (4.8.4).

The Jihadist player aid sheet summarizes this section.

8.1.1 Operations Value. Unlike US operations, Jihadist operations
can use any card, regardless of a target country’s Governance.
However, almost all Jihadist operations require die rolls. Card value
determines the number of dice rolled (8.1.2). Governance determines
the success range of rolls:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Good: 1 (1 only)
Fair: 2 or less (1 or 2)
Poor: 3 or less (1, 2, or 3)
Islamist Rule: Automatic (all rolls succeed).

8.2.3 Regime Change Recruiting. Recruit rolls in Regime Change
countries (7.3.4.1) automatically succeed.
8.2.4 Recruit Numbers. A few non-Muslim countries have printed
“REC” die-roll numbers (4.3.4). Recruit operations there ignore
Governance and instead must roll less than or equal to the printed
“REC” number to succeed.
EXAMPLE: Recruit operations in the PHILIPPINES succeed on
rolls of 3 or less, not 2 or less.

EXCEPTIONS: Recruiting in Regime Change countries (8.2.3) and
Travel to adjacent or within the same countries (8.3.1) is automatic.
8.1.2 Procedure: For each card played for operations, select and
announce one type of operation and where the operation(s) will occur. (Multiple locales may be involved.) Then roll a number of dice
equal to the card’s value to determine how many of the operations
succeed. (If more than one country is involved, specify before rolling which dice are being rolled for which locales. All rolls from a
given card are considered simultaneous.)
EXAMPLE: The Jihadist side plays a 3-value card for operations
and announces that the operations type will be Recruit and that two
attempts will occur in AFGHANISTAN and one in Central Asia,
both currently at Fair Ally. The player rolls two dice and one die,
respectively, and places a cell for each roll of 1 or 2. If the player
rolled three successes but only two cells were Available (4.7.4.2 &amp;
8.2.1), the player would then select how to distribute the two cells
between the two countries.
The Jihadist side then plays a
second 3-value card and announces it will be for Travel.
The player specifies that one
cell in AFGHANISTAN will
attempt Travel to the United
States and a second in AFGHANISTAN plus a third in
PAKISTAN will attempt Travel
to Iraq, currently a Poor Adversary. The player then makes
three separate rolls, the Travel to the US succeeding only on a 1,
those to Iraq on 1-3.

8.3 TRAVEL

8.3.1 Each point of card value used for Travel enables a cell to move
from country to country and, if Active, shifts it to Sleeper. Non-adjacent Travel must roll the destination country’s Governance number
or less to succeed. Travel between adjacent countries or within a
country (in order to recover Sleep status) automatically succeeds.
8.3.2 Failed Travel Rolls. A failed Travel roll removes the cell to
the Funding Track (do not place a cadre, 4.8.4).
8.3.3 Designate all origin and destination countries for a card play before rolling. A cell may only Travel once on play of a given card.
Note that a Travel attempt to an unmarked country would result in
a Test of the country’s Governance or Posture before executing the
Travel (4.9.4).

8.4 JIHAD

A Jihad operation targets Governance and Aid. The target countries
must be Muslim (not IRAN) and not under Islamist Rule. At least
one cell must be present in each target country for each roll made
there. Any Sleeper cell used to support this roll shifts to Active.
8.4.1 Minor Jihad. Each successful roll worsens Governance in
that roll’s target country by one level toward Poor (Good to Fair,
Fair to Poor) and removes one Aid marker. Note that, unless conditions for Major Jihad are met (8.4.2), a Jihad operation cannot shift
a country to Islamist Rule.
8.4.2 Major Jihad. If the number of cells in the country exceeds
the number of troops by five or more at the operation’s outset and
the Jihadist side chooses in advance to shift all Sleeper cells there to
Active, then two successful rolls on a single card worsen Governance
from Poor to Islamist Rule (see 8.4.4). Each successful roll removes
one Aid. Note that, with the exception of Besieged Regime (8.4.3.2),

© 2010 &amp; 2011 GMT Games, LCC

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition
a 2- or 3-value card is needed to get to Islamist Rule.

11

8.5 PLOT

8.4.3 Failed Jihad. Each failed Jihad roll removes a cell to the
Funding Track (do not place a cadre, 4.8.4).
8.4.3.1 Major Jihad Failure. Whenever the Jihadists roll three dice
for Jihad in a country already at Poor and fail to shift it to Islamist Rule,
place a “Besieged Regime” marker in the country (if one is not already
there) and shift the country’s Alignment one box toward Ally.
8.4.3.2 Besieged Regime. A country with a Besieged Regime marker requires only one successful Jihad roll (rather
than two) to shift it from Poor Governance to Islamist Rule.
A country may have at most one Besieged Regime marker.
Remove the marker if Governance shifts to Good or Islamist Rule.
8.4.4 Islamist Revolution. Whenever Governance shifts to Islamist
Rule, mark Alignment as Adversary (regardless of any failure roll)
and remove any Regime Change, Besieged Regime, or Aid markers.
Increase Funding by that country’s Resources. If troops are present,
set Prestige to “1”. (The troops remain.)
8.4.5 Pakistani Arsenal. The first time PAKISTAN shifts to Islamist
Rule, place the three WMD Plot markers from the Pakistani Arsenal
Box into the Available Plots box (4.7.8.1). They are Available for
later Plots.
JIHAD EXAMPLE A: There are two cells in a country at Good, and all
other cells are in non-Muslim or Islamist Rule countries. The Jihadists
play a 3-card for Jihad, but can only use 2 of the 3 operations value.
Both cells go Active. The rolls are a “1” and a “4”. The die roll of
“1” is a success and worsens Governance to Fair, while the die roll
of “4” is a failure and causes one cell to be removed.
JIHAD EXAMPLE B: Jihadists have six Sleeper cells in a Neutral
country under Fair-2 Governance and use three operations for
Major Jihad there, rolling “1”, “2”, and “3”. The cells shift to Active. The first success (the “1”) shifts Governance to Poor. Because
there is only one additional success (the “2”), there is no further
shift from Poor to Islamist Rule (8.4.2), even though there were five
more cells than troops. The single failure (the “3”) removes one cell
(8.4.3). The “3” fails because the simultaneous rolls were against
“Fair-2” (8.1.2). No Besieged Regime marker is placed, nor does
Alignment shift to Ally, because the target was not at Poor at the
commencement of the operation (8.4.3.1). Note that a single 3-card
play can be both a Minor and Major Jihad at the same time if played
on a Fair country and all three rolls succeed.
JIHAD EXAMPLE C: The Jihadist side plays a 3-card and announces Major Jihad in PAKISTAN, a Poor Ally where there currently are
seven cells, two troops, and an Aid marker. After shifting all seven
cells to Active, the Jihadist player picks up and rolls three dice,
obtaining rolls of “2”, “3”, and “4”. The “4”—a failure—causes
removal of a cell from PAKISTAN, leaving six cells there, while the
“2” and “3”—the two successful rolls needed for Islamist Revolution—worsen Pakistan’s Governance from Poor to Islamist Rule. The
player shifts PAKISTAN from Poor Ally to Islamist Rule Adversary,
removes the Aid, shifts Funding up by two (+2), and places the three
WMD Plot markers from the Pakistani Arsenal box into the Event
Box for later Jihadist use. US Prestige drops to “1”; the two troops
remain in Islamist Rule PAKISTAN.

8.5.1 In General. A Plot operation may target any country (including IRAN) not under Islamist Rule. At least
one cell must be present in each target country for each
roll made there, and any Sleeper cell used to allow a roll
shifts to Active. At least one Plot roll must be made for a card to be
used as a Plot operation to avoid a US-associated event (8.5.3).
8.5.2 Procedure. Roll the appropriate number of dice (8.1.1). Each
successful roll places into the target country an Available Plot
marker with a number equal to or less than the card value used, or
an available WMD marker, face down (8.5.4). A failed Plot roll has
no further effect.
NOTE: The Plot markers in the game limit the number and types of
Plots that can be placed at a time (4.8.1). “Available Plots” are those
markers currently in the Available Plots box (4.7.8 &amp; 8.5.5.).
8.5.3 First Plot. The first use each turn of a card for Plot operations
ignores rather than triggers any US-associated event (6.3.2). (Place
the card in the 1st Plot box as a reminder, 4.7.7.2.).
Tip: Always place the first card you execute a Plot Operation with
in the 1st Plot box on the map as a reminder that the Jihadists have
conducted their 1st Plot Operation.
NOTE: This allows the Jihadist player the ability to ignore one USassociated event in his hand each turn. The card does not have to be
the first card he plays, just the first Plot operation he conducts. Also
note that the Jihadist side could not avoid a US-associated event with
a 1st Plot if only Islamist Rule countries had cells (8.5.1).
8.5.4 Hidden Plots. Keep placed Plot markers face down (showing
just “Terror Plot”, 4.8.1)—only the Jihadist side may inspect them.
Reveal their values (or WMD) to the US only as they are blocked
by Alert or resolved.
8.5.5 WMD Plots. Any WMD Plot markers in the Available Plots
box may be placed upon any successful Plot operation roll (8.5.2).
When a WMD Plot is either blocked (7.5.2-3) or resolved, remove
the WMD Plot marker from the game.
8.5.6 Unblocked Plots. At the end of each US Action Phase, the
Jihadist player must reveal and resolve any Plot markers that remain
in any countries. He chooses the order. Resolution is as follows:
VICTORY
•	 If a WMD Plot in the US, the Jihadists win.
FUNDING
•	 For any Plot in a Muslim country or IRAN, add +1 to Funding
if Governance is worse than Good; or +2 if the country is at
Good.
•	 For a non-WMD Plot in a non-Muslim country outside the US,
increase Funding by the Plot number or, if at Good, by twice that
number.
•	 For a WMD Plot in a non-Muslim country, or any Plot in the US,
set Funding to “9”.
POSTURE
•	 If the plot is in a non-Muslim country (including the US), roll the
country’s Posture. If WMD in a 2-player game, the Jihadist side
may reroll this result once.
•	 If in the Schengen area, the Jihadist side selects two other Schengen countries and rolls their Postures.

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

PRESTIGE
•	 If the target country has troops, lower Prestige by one (–1) or set
Prestige to “1” if the Plot is WMD.
•	 If in the US, make a Prestige roll.
GOVERNANCE AND AID
•	 If the plot is in a Muslim country, roll a number of dice equal to
the Plot number (3 dice if WMD) as if attempting a Jihadist operation in the country (8.1). Each success removes one Aid marker
and worsens Governance by one level, but not to Islamist Rule.
Failure has no effect.
MARKER
•	 Return the Plot marker to the Available Plots box (or remove it
from the game if WMD).
NOTE: Both Player Aid Cards summarize how to resolve Unblocked
Plots.

STOP!!

You have read all the 2-player rules.
The remaining rules apply only to solitaire.

9.0 JIHADIST ACTIVITIES
(1-PLAYER)

This section contains rules for playing the game solitaire and modifies previous sections. When in conflict, the rules in this section take
precedence for solitaire play. To play the game solitaire, the player
takes the US side. This rules section and the Jihadist Activities chart
govern the Jihadists.

9.1 HOW TO WIN

Elimination of the last cell does not cause a US win (continue play).
Islamist Rule over 6 or more Resources results in a Jihadist win,
regardless of adjacency (modifies 2.1). If the game ends via Reshuffle
(3.3), the US loses a 1-deck game if fewer than 6 Resources are
Good, loses a 2-deck game if fewer than 9, and a 3-deck game if
fewer than 12 (modifies 2.3; other conditions still apply).

9.2 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

Deal the Jihadists’ cards (5.2.8) as a face-down pile, playing, removing, or adding cards from or to the top. Inspect them (5.3.2) only
to implement the Intel Community or FSB events. After resolving
FSB, shuffle the Jihadist hand.
EXAMPLE: Event instructions to take a “random” Jihadist card
would take the top Jihadist card.

OPTIONAL

For less variability in difficulty, divide the deck at set up and after
each Reshuffle into three face-down, shuffled “mini-decks”:
•	 Unassociated events,
•	 Jihadist-associated events,
•	 US-associated events.
Deal and shuffle the entire Jihadist hand, then deal the US hand.
For each deal or event-driven draw from the deck, draw one
card from each mini-deck that still has cards, in the above order,
returning to Unassociated after US-associated. Exhaustion of all
three mini-decks triggers Reshuffle (5.3.1).

9.3 OPERATIONS

9.3.1 Choosing Cells. For operations or events from Jihadist card
play, choose any Active cells within a country before Sleeper cells.
EXCEPTION: Choose Sadr last.
9.3.2 Placing Plots. Plot success or event places a random Plot
marker from Available Plots (modifies 8.5.2—note that card value
does not restrict Plot value; Danish Cartoons and Zarqawi still place
a specific numbered Plot if indicated).
9.3.3 Acquiring WMD. Each WMD Plot marker added to the Event
Box replaces one of the lowest available numbered Plot markers.
(Set replaced Plot markers aside so that there are always exactly 6
Plot markers in play.) When a WMD Plot marker is used, return the
highest set-aside numbered Plot marker to the Event Box (modifies
4.7.8.1).

9.4 JIHADIST CARD PLAY

Implement each Jihadist card play (6.0) as follows.
NOTE: The Jihadist Activities charts on the inside of both Player
Aid Cards summarize this section.
9.4.1 Event or OPS?
First, follow the “Event or OPS?” flow chart to determine whether
the card’s event occurs and what, if any, operations the Jihadist side
will perform:
•	 If the card is a playable (6.2.6) Jihadist or Unassociated event,
play the event (even if it provides no effect or to US advantage).
EXCEPTION: When there are no cells on the Funding track,
an event that would Recruit or place a cell instead triggers
Radicalization (9.4.3).
•	 If the card drawn is a playable US event, Plot; no event occurs.
•	 If the Jihadists played an Unassociated event or the event is not
playable, roll Major Jihad if a successful Major Jihad (one that
could result in Islamist Rule, 8.4.2) is possible.
•	 If Major Jihad success is not possible, roll Minor Jihad if possible
in a Good or Fair country.
•	 If Jihad is not possible in a Good or Fair country, Recruit if
any cells are Available (4.7.4.2) and the GTMO event is not in
effect.
•	 If no cells are Available or GTMO is in effect, Travel.
For any unusable operations value left over, see Radicalization
(9.4.3).
Note that Jihadist card play never triggers US events (6.3.2; ignore
“1st Plot”, 4.7.7.2) nor uses Reserves (6.3.3) and, for playable
Unassociated events, yields the event before the operations.
9.4.2 Where?
Second, use the appropriate “Where?” flow chart or Random Country
die roll tables (9.5) to determine where Jihadist operations or events
occur. Within each green flow chart box, apply the “Priorities” listed
in the appropriate white box, as needed, to select a country. To the
degree possible with cells present in a given country, and unless
otherwise noted (such as Travel, 9.4.2.6-6.1; Radicalization, 9.4.3),
conduct Jihadist operations from a given card within a selected
country before moving on to another.
9.4.2.1 For event-driven activities, use Jihadist Activities charts as
follows:
•	 For Plot placement, use “Plot”. If Radicalization results, use the
card’s value for Radicalization (9.4.3) and ignore the event. (For

© 2010 &amp; 2011 GMT Games, LCC

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition
Zarqawi cell and plot placement follow cell placement, below.)
•	 For Governance or Alignment shifts, use “Minor Jihad”. For Iran
and Jaysh Al-Mahdi, roll on the “Shia-Mix” table (9.5), test the
resulting country if Unmarked, then find the closest applicable
country at Good then Fair.
•	 For cell placement, select randomly among potential countries
(9.5). For Lebanon War, roll on the “Shia-Mix” table. For Jihadist
Videos and Madrassas Recruitment (including the subsequent
card), roll on the “Global” table (9.5) and find the closest
applicable country.
•	 For Schengen Visas Travel, begin at the indicated “To” box to
select destinations, rolling on the “Schengen” table if there are
several possibilities. For Clean Operatives, the 2 cells’ destination is the UNITED STATES. For either event, use “From” for
origin.
Note that a handful of events have additional solitaire implementation instructions (9.6).
9.4.2.2 Roll for or place Plots as much as possible in the United
States, then:
•	 If Prestige is above Low, first in the PHILIPPINES if Abu Sayyaf
is in effect and the PHILIPPINES hosts at least as many cells as
troops, then in countries with troops.
•	 Then, if the GWOT Penalty is 0 (4.7.2.1), in countries with the
same Posture as the US.
•	 Then in countries with Aid markers.
•	 Then, if Funding is less than 9, in any non-Muslim, and then
Muslim countries or IRAN.
•	 Then use any remaining operations for Radicalization (9.4.3).
Within the sequence above, give priority to Fair countries over Good
then Poor if conducting Plot operations; Good over Fair then Poor
if placing plots via event.
9.4.2.3 If Major Jihad is possible in more than one country, select
PAKISTAN, then the country with the highest Resources.
9.4.2.4 Roll Minor Jihad or shift Governance or Alignment first in
countries at Good, then Fair. Then, if shifting Alignment, do so in a
country at Poor. Within this sequence, target PAKISTAN first, then
countries with Aid, then Besieged Regimes, then the highest Resources. Use any remaining operations for Radicalization (9.4.3).
9.4.2.5 In descending order of priority, Recruit in:
•	 A Regime Change country where troops outnumber cells by five
or more,
•	 An Islamist Rule country with fewer cells than twice the operations
value of the card,
•	 A non-Islamist Rule and non-Regime Change country with
the highest required roll for Recruit success (whether due to
Governance, 8.1.1, or Recruit Number).
Within this sequence, select a Besieged Regime, if any, then the
country with the highest sum of troops plus cells, then (if the choice
is only among Muslim countries) the country with the highest Resources. Roll one Recruit operation at a time. If there is no suitable
location, or if Available cells on the Funding Track run out while
operations value remains, conduct Radicalization (9.4.3).
NOTE: For cell placement by event, Jihadist Videos, and Madrassas, use 9.5 to select randomly rather than using this sequence
(9.4.2.1).

13

9.4.2.6 For Travel, first select all destinations, in descending order,
for one cell each (maximum per category or flowchart box):
•	 A non-Islamist Rule country with Besieged Regime, then Regime
Change, then Aid, if any.
•	 A Poor country where Major Jihad would be possible if two (or
fewer) cells were added.
•	 A Good or Fair Muslim country with at least one cell adjacent.
•	 An unmarked non-Muslim country if US Posture is Hard, or a
Soft non-Muslim country if US Posture is Soft.
If operations remain, select a destination randomly (9.5) for Travel
with that number of cells. Within the bulleted categories above, select
PAKISTAN first, then (if all possibilities are Muslim), from among
those with the highest Resources. If the Biometrics event is in play
and no cells are adjacent to the selected destination, use the card’s
operations value for Radicalization instead (9.4.3).
9.4.2.6.1 Next, separately select the origin for each destination, in
descending order:
•	 An Islamist Rule country with more cells than the card’s operations
value.
•	 Regime Change country with more than 5 cells.
•	 An adjacent country.
•	 Randomly among countries with cells, including the destination
country itself (resulting, if selected, in any Active cell used becoming a Sleeper, 4.6.4).
Within the bulleted categories above, first select countries with at
least one Active cell not yet committed to Travel. If possible, avoid
selecting any separate destination country as an origin on the same
card play. If the last cell in an Islamist Rule or Regime Change country travels, it travels within the country (becomes or stays a Sleeper,
4.6.4) rather than to the destination selected per 9.4.2.6.
9.4.2.6.2 Finally, conduct all Travel (one attempt per cell).
9.4.3 Radicalization
When the flowcharts set up a situation where the Jihadists cannot
use any operations value received from a card, instead:
•	 If the Funding track has a cell, the 1st operations value remaining
automatically places one cell into a random country.
•	 The next operations value Travels one cell (determine destination
and origin using the flowcharts, 9.4.2.6, starting at the second “To”
box); the Travel automatically succeeds (ignore Biometrics).
•	 If Funding is less than 9, the next operations value automatically
places a Plot (9.3.2) into a random non-Islamist Rule country with
a cell.
•	 Each operations value that remains automatically worsens the
Governance of a randomly selected Good or Fair Muslim country
by one level.
EXAMPLE: The Jihadist card is a 3-value playable US event, but
there is only one cell on the map. Conduct one Plot operation with
the cell (9.4.1), then place one cell from the track (regardless of
Funding) into a randomly-selected country (9.5), then automatically
Travel with one cell.

9.5 RANDOM COUNTRY

Whenever the “Where?” flow charts (9.4.2), scenario set up, Jihadist
event, or other instructions yield multiple, equal-priority country
options on the map, or specify “random” or “randomly”, select
randomly, as follows:

© 2010 &amp; 2011 GMT Games, LCC

14

Labyrinth — 2nd Edition

•	 If there are 6 or fewer options and neither Schengen nor Shia-Mix
is specified, assign each candidate country a die roll number (or
equal die-roll range) and roll a die.
•	 If more than 6 options, roll one tan and one black die on the
“Global” table. If non-Muslim or Muslim is specified, roll the
tan die until an appropriate column (blue or green, respectively)
results (reroll a result of “IRAN”, if appropriate).
•	 If Schengen is specified (such as for extra Posture rolls after a
Plot in the Schengen area, 8.5.6), roll one die on the “Schengen”
table (note the table for convenience omits EASTERN EUROPE,
even though it counts as a Schengen country.)
•	 If Shia-Mix is specified, sum together a roll of three dice on the
“Shia-Mix” table.
9.5.1 Closest Country
If a Random Country table roll results in an ineligible locale, find
the closest eligible countries to it (counting by adjacent countries)
and select among them by die roll (per 9.5, first bullet).
EXAMPLE: The Jihadists are to use two operations to Plot. No cells
are in the United States, and Abu Sayyaf is not in effect. Prestige is
High, there are US troops and two cells each in AFGHANISTAN and
Gulf States, and both countries are at Fair. Because the Jihadist Activities “Where?” chart gives both countries an equal priority as the
locale of the Plot operations, the player designates AFGHANISTAN
“1-3” and Gulf States “4-6” and rolls a die to determine where the
two operations occur.

9.6 INDIVIDUAL EVENT INSTRUCTIONS

•	 Ex-KGB: Target Caucasus if that would shift the World Posture
marker (4.7.2), otherwise target CENTRAL ASIA.
•	 Leak: Randomly select among Enhanced Measures, Renditions,
and Wiretapping markers in the Event Box.
•	 Oil Price Spike: Draw from the Discard Pile randomly among the
highest-value Jihadist-associated event cards. If none is available,
use Oil Price Spike for operations (only).
PLAY NOTE: Keeping discarded Jihadist-associated 3-cards in a
separate stack eases implementation of Oil Price Spike.

9.7 JIHADIST IDEOLOGY

The above rules provide a level of play suitable for learning the
game. Once familiar—or if you prefer to dive straight into a greater
challenge—take on one of these ascending levels of US difficulty,
representing the receptivity of Muslims to Jihadism:
•	 Coherent: Each Plot success places two Available Plot markers
(modifies 8.5.2).
•	 Attractive: Each Recruit success places two available cells
(modifies 8.2.1).
•	 Potent: The above, plus just three more cells than troops allows
Major Jihad (modifies 8.4.2).
•	 Infectious: The above, plus the US must play all its cards
(modifies 5.2.4).
•	 Virulent: The above, plus failed Jihad rolls do not remove cells
(modifies 8.4.3).

SCENARIOS

Let’s Roll!

Anaconda

Mission Accomplished?

It is September 12th, 2001. Al-Qaeda has
pulled off a devastating “martyrdom operation” in the United States that it hopes will
light the fires of Islamist revolution. The
US—caught off guard—has awaken and is
about to respond…

It is early 2002. The United States has carried
out a swift military operation to remove the
Taliban regime of Afghanistan and scatter alQaeda. Jihadist losses have been heavy, but
al-Qaeda’s leadership has escaped…

It is mid-2003. The United States has gambled
on pre-emptive war in Iraq in hopes of forging democracy in the heart of the Muslim
world. But US overstretch, European doubts,
and Iraqi resistance offer the Jihadists an
opening…

						               													<description>From the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2001: The &amp;ldquo;American Century&amp;rdquo; had closed with a single Cold War superpower standing and a pause in conflict that some at the time dubbed &amp;ldquo;The End of History&amp;rdquo;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&amp;rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bin Ladin&amp;rsquo;s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet &amp;ldquo;Bear Trap&amp;rdquo; of the 1980s. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &amp;mdash; this time within the US Homeland &amp;mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT&amp;rsquo;s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&amp;rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &amp;mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and later Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake, Labyrinth combines an emphasis on game play with multifaceted simulation spanning recent history and near future. In the 2-player game, one player takes the role of jihadists seeking to exploit world events and Islamic donations to spread fundamentalist rule over the Muslim world. The other player as the United States must neutralize terrorist cells while encouraging Muslim democratic reform to cut off extremism at its roots. With the game&amp;rsquo;s solitaire system, a single player as the US takes on ascending levels of challenge in defeating al-Qaeda and its allies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The jihadists must operate in a hostile environment &amp;mdash; staying below the authorities&amp;rsquo; radar while plotting terrorist attacks and building for the Muslim revolution. Will Iran&amp;rsquo;s Shia mullahs help or hinder the Sunni jihadists? Will the gradual spread of Islamist rule bring final victory &amp;mdash; or will it be a sudden strike at the United States with an Islamic weapon of mass destruction?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The United States has the full weight of its military force and diplomacy at the ready &amp;mdash; but it can&amp;rsquo;t be everywhere: will technological and material superiority be enough? US forces can invade and topple Islamist regimes, but how will the Muslim &amp;ldquo;street&amp;rdquo; react? And if quagmire results, how will the US find its way out?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Labyrinth features distinct operational options for each side that capture the asymmetrical nature of the conflict, while the event cards that drive its action pose a maze of political, religious, military, and economic issues. In the parallel wars of bombs and ideas, coordinated international effort is key &amp;mdash; but terrorist opportunities to disrupt Western unity are many. The Towers have fallen, but the global struggle has only just begun. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s roll!&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
