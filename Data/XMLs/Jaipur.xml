				<rulebook>INTRODUCTION AND AIM OF THE GAME
Jaipur... You are hoping to become the Maharaja’s personal trader by
being richer than your opponent at the end of each week (round).
To do so, collect and exchange goods (cards) at the market, then sell
them for rupees (on the back of the tokens). If you manage to put
together a really good deal (three cards or more), then you’ll receive
a reward (bonus token).
As for the camels, they are mainly used for exchanges when you want
to take multiple goods at the market.

Take the first two cards from the deck and place them face up
next to the camels. (There may well be 1 or 2 camels drawn.)
The market is now ready.
The players then remove any camels from their hands and put them
face up in a in a stack in front of them. This forms each player’s herd.
This is what a game might look like at the start.

At the end of each round, the richer trader receives a Seal of
Excellence
. The first player to collect 2 of these wins the game.

MATERIAL
55 goods cards
6 x diamonds

6 x gold

6 x silver

8 x cloth

Market
Deck
Herd

Sort the tokens by goods type.
8 x spice

10 x leather

11 x camels

back

Make a pile for each goods type in descending order of value.
Spread out each pile so that both players can see all the tokens’
values.
Sort the bonus tokens by type ( ,
,
). Shuffle each type
separately, then form 3 piles, which are not spread out.
Put the camel token next to the bonus tokens.

38 goods tokens

1 camel token

18 bonus tokens

Set up the tokens as shown in the above illustration.
Put the 3 Seals of Excellence where the players can get at them.
Pick a starting player.

3 Seals of Excellence

NB: the value of the goods tokens is
shown in small type on the front and
large on the back. The value
of the bonus tokens is only
shown on the back.

SET-UP
Place 3 camel cards face up between the players.
Shuffle the remaining cards well.
Deal 5 cards to each player.
The remaining cards are left face down as a draw pile (deck).

You are now ready to start playing.

GAME TURN
On your turn, you can either :

TAKE CARDS

OR

SELL CARDS

But never both !
Your turn is now over and your opponent chooses one
of these actions.

TAKE CARDS

SELL CARDS

If you take cards, you must choose one of the following options :
A take several goods (=EXCHANGE !),
B take 1 single good,
These 3 options are shown
C take all the camels.

To sell cards, choose one type of good and discard as many cards
of that type as you like onto the discard pile. Each sale earns goods
tokens and, if the sale is big enough, a bonus.
A sale is carried out in 3 steps.

in detail below.

A
Take several goods

1
Sell as many cards
as you want, placing
them face up on the
discard pile.

Herd

Take all the goods cards
that you want into your hand
(they can be of different types),
then...

... exchange the same number
of cards. The returned cards
can be camels, goods,
or a combination of the two.

B
Take 1 single good

Take as many tokens as cards
discarded (starting with the
“top” of the corresponding
row, that is, starting with the
highest values.)

2

Stack the tokens in front
of you.

3

Take a single goods
card from the market
into your hand, then...

... replace it
with the top card from
the deck.

C
Take the camels

If you sell 3 or
more cards, take the corresponding bonus token.

3 cards sold
4 cards sold
5 cards sold

(or more)

NB: the value of a bonus is not known until it is drawn. For 3 cards sold, it will
be 1, 2 or 3 rupees. For 4 cards sold, it will be 4, 5 or 6 rupees and for 5 cards sold,
it will be 8, 9 or 10 rupees. Unlike the goods tokens, the rupee value of the bonus
token is only printed on the back (hence the question marks on the front).

Restrictions during a sale

Take ALL the
camels from the market and
add them to your herd, then...

... replace the cards
taken by drawing
from the deck

ATTENTION
Players may never have more than 7 cards in their hand at the end of their turn.

When selling the 3 most expensive goods (diamonds, gold and silver), the sale must include
a minimum of 2 cards. (This rule applies even if
there is only one goods token of a given type left.)
REMINDER
You can only sell one goods type each round, never more.

END OF A ROUND

REMINDERS AND NOTES

A round ends immediately if :
3 types of goods token
are depleted.

OR

There are no cards left in the draw
pile when trying to fill the market.

When you take cards from the market, you either take goods
or camels, but never both.
If you decide to take the camels, you must always take all the
camels at the market.
When making an exchange :
- the surrendered cards can be camels, goods or a mixture of the two;
- the same goods type cannot be both surrendered and taken at
the market;
- you can never exchange just 1 card from your hand against 1 from
the market. An exchange always involves at least 2 cards for 2 cards.

Deck

If both players have the same number of camels at the end
of a round, neither takes the camel token (5 rupees).
Sometimes there are fewer tokens available than cards during
a sale. In that case, you still receive the bonus token for the
number of cards sold.

SCORING
The player with the most camels in his herd receives the camel
token, worth 5 rupees.
The players turn over their tokens and add them up to determine
who is the richer.
(We suggest that you make piles of
10 rupees as these are easier for children
to count, and quicker for adults, as well
as being more practical if you need to
recount them.)

10 + 10 + 10 + 10
10 + 10 + 10 +

= 73

Players are not required to let their opponent know how many
camels they possess.
Camels do not count towards the 7 card hand limit.

ADVICE

3

NB: it is best to read this after your first game.

The richer trader takes a Seal of Excellence.
In the case of a tie, the player with the most bonus tokens takes
the seal. If the players are still tied, the one with the most goods
tokens takes the seal.

NEW ROUND
If neither player has 2 Seals of Excellence yet, set up the game again
from the beginning and play a new round. The player who lost
the previous round starts.

END OF THE GAME
The game ends immediately as soon as one
of the players has 2 Seals of Excellence.
That player wins the game and is appointed
as the Maharaja’s personal trader.

The use of the camels is a balancing act: if you don’t have any then
you have a problem if you want to take a lot of cards and your hand is
empty. However, if you take a lot of camels then you risk leaving a very
profitable market for your opponent.
If you do decide to take a large group of camels, it can be worthwhile
doing this when your opponent already has 7 cards in hand. Then, if the
new market is interesting, he’ll have to exchange cards and probably
won’t be able to take all the cards wanted.
If you think that some valuable cards are due to turn up, it can be
advantageous to make an exchange that fills the market with camels,
forcing your opponent to open up the game for you.
There are three main sources of income: the 3 expensive goods,
the first tokens in each set, and the big sales bonuses. All three are important : don’t let your opponent grab the lion’s share of the diamonds,
gold and silver, sell before him if you can, and try to make one or
two really big sales !

						               													<description>You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that's not enough for you because only the merchant with two &amp;quot;seals of excellence&amp;quot; will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
