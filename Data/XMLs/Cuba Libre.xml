1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.2 Components

Cuba Libre is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent
and counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict in Cuba, 1957-1958. Each
player takes the role of a Faction seeking to run Cuban affairs: the
Government (Govt) or 1 of 3 Insurgent Factions—the leftist Movement of 26July (26July or M26), the anti-communist, anti-Batista
Revolutionary Directorate (Directorio or DR), and the organized
crime Syndicate. Using military, political, and economic actions
and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces
to influence the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve
their Faction’s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events,
victory checks, and the like. The rules can run non-player Factions,
enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.
Cuba Libre is the second volume in the COIN Series of games using
similar rules to cover a variety of modern insurgencies, and other
factional conflicts. The Playbook on page 14 summarizes key rules
differences.
This rule book lists and defines key game terms in an index on
pages 17 to 18. The most important game functions are summarized
on several aid sheets. Game set up is explained on the back of this
rule book.

1.1 General Course of Play

Cuba Libre—unlike most card-assisted war games—does not use
hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one at time,
with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event card shows
the order in which the Factions become Eligible to choose between
the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations and Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries the penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next card. Propaganda
cards mixed in with the Event cards provide periodic opportunities
for instant wins and for activities such as collecting resources and
influencing popular sympathies.

A complete set of Cuba Libre includes:
•	 A 17”x22” mounted game board (1.3).
•	 A deck of 52 cards (5.0).
•	 86 dark and light blue, red, green, and yellow wooden forces
pieces, some embossed (1.4; see “Available Forces” on page 20
for a complete listing).
•	 8 embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.2).
•	 6 white and 6 black pawns (3.1.1).
•	 A sheet of markers.
•	 2 (identical) Sequence of Play sheets (1.3.1, 2.0, 5.0, 6.0).
•	 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0)
•	 A Non-player aid foldout (8.0).
•	 3 6-sided dice—1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green.
•	 A background play book.
•	 This rule book.

1.3 The Map

The map shows the island of Cuba divided into various types of
spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Provinces, urban Cities,
and Economic Centers (ECs). All can hold forces.
1.3.2 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population value (Pop)
of 1 or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to the
Government (1.6) or Control (1.7) and some Insurgent Operations
(3.3). Provinces are further distinguished by terrain as Forest,
Mountain, or Grassland, affecting some COIN Operations (3.2)
and Events (5.0).
1.3.3 Cities. Each City shows a Population value of 1 or 6.

1.3.4 ECs. Each Economic Center (EC) shows an Economic value
(Econ) of 2 or 3 affecting Government and Syndicate Resources
(1.8).

DESIGN NOTE: ECs represent zones of economic activity important
to the government —such as sugar, mining, and tobacco—the majority owned by US corporations. The towns Santa Clara and Guantanamo are not spaces; they are shown for historical interest.

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: Government Troops (dark-blue cubes) and Police (light-blue cubes),
Insurgent Guerrillas, and all Factions’ Bases. The Syndicate Faction’s
Bases are a special type called Casinos (1.4.4-.5, 3.3.5).
DESIGN NOTE: Bases represent not only bivouacs and training
camps but also, for the 26July and Directorio Factions, political
administration and, for the Syndicate, casinos.

NOTE: Cash markers (4.5.2), though not forces or pieces, stack with
a specific Guerrilla or cube while on the map.
1.4.1 Availability and Removal. The inventory shown on the
“Available Forces” chart on the back of this rule book limits the
number of pieces that may be in play. Keep forces not on the map
in the Forces holding boxes. (Place Bases in the highest-numbered
empty circles, revealing the number of on-map Bases to help track
victory, 7.0)

•	 Forces may only be placed from or replaced with those available
in the holding boxes—ignore any instructions to place forces if
the appropriate type is not available because all are already on
the map (remove rather than replace such pieces).
•	 Important: A player Faction while executing an Operation, Special
Activity, or Event may remove its own pieces (including Casinos)
to Available Forces. EXAMPLE: Insurgents without Available
Guerrillas could remove Active Guerrillas during a Rally (3.3.1)
in order to place them Underground.
•	 Once an enemy Faction is targeted, removal or Activation of
pieces to the extent of the executing Faction’s ability is required.
EXAMPLE: A Government Assault (3.2.4) with 3 Troops in Forest
must remove 3 Active pieces if there are at least that many among
those Factions targeted.

1.4.2 Stacking. At most 2 non-Casino Bases (total Bases of Government, 26July, plus Directorio) plus 2 Casinos may occupy a single
Province or City. Bases and Casinos may not occupy ECs.
•	 Ignore any instructions (such as from Operations or Events) to
place or move forces if stacking would be violated. EXCEPTION:
“Sinatra” Event.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas are either
Underground—symbol end down, or Active—symbol end up. Certain actions flip them from one to the
other state. Always set up and place new Guerrillas
Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless text specifies “Underground” Guerrilla, it is sufficient
to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active).
1.4.4 Open/Closed. Casinos are either open—symbol up, or
closed—symbol down. Set up and place Casinos open. EXCEPTION: Construct, 3.3.5.
1.4.5 Casinos Not Removed. Any action that would remove or replace a normal Base instead closes an open Casino and has no effect
on a closed Casino (3.2.4, 3.3.3, 4.2.2, 4.4.3, 5.1.1). EXCEPTION:
The Syndicate may voluntarily remove or close Casinos (1.4.1).
DESIGN NOTE: Although rebels would disrupt casino operations,
the Cuban Revolution did not see large-scale attacks on casinos,
hotels, or other Syndicate holdings. An Assault or Air Strike that
closes a Casino may represent authorities forcing closure in order
to pressure the Mob or nearby fighting blocking revenue.

1.5 Players & Factions

Cuba Libre may have up to 4 players, each as 1 or more Factions:
26July (or M26, red), the Government (Govt, blue), the Directorio
(DR, yellow) or the Syndicate (green). In a 1-player game, the player
plays Government and Syndicate together, or 26July and DR, or
any 1 Faction (8.9). Leftover Factions are controlled either by rules
section 8 as “Non-players” or, if preferred with 2 or 3 players, as
below. Each of the Factions is enemy to all others.
No Non-Player Option: If playing with 2 or 3 players, ignore
the Non-Player rules (8.0). Instead, players control leftover
Factions:

•	 With 3 players, 26July controls Directorio (or, if players
prefer, the Government controls the Syndicate).
•	 With 2 players, 26July controls Directorio and Government
controls Syndicate.

Play only stops on a victory check (6.1) if all of a player’s Factions are meeting their conditions.

After final Propaganda, use the lowest victory margin of each
player’s Factions (7.3). Players may not voluntarily transfer
(1.5.1) anything between their own Factions (including Cash,
4.5.2). NOTE: A Government/Syndicate player could provide
Government cubes with Cash using the Syndicate’s Profit
Special Activity (4.5.1) and must Skim (6.2.3).

Total Support equals:
(2 x Population in Active Support) + (1 x Population in Passive Support)

Total Opposition equals:
(2 x Population in Active Opposition) + (1 x Population in
Passive Opposition)
Opposition + Bases equals:
Total Opposition + The number of 26July Bases on the map

DR Pop + Bases equals:
Population of all spaces Controlled by Directorio + The number
of Directorio Bases on the map
•	 Directorio victory depends on the sum of Population Controlled by Directorio (1.7) plus Directorio Bases – “DR Pop
+ Bases”.
•	 Syndicate victory includes the number of “Open Casinos”
on the map (1.4.4).

NOTE: The 12 “Deception” markers are for a victory-related
optional rule (7.3).

1.7 Control

1.5.1 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules but may voluntarily transfer only Resources (1.8) or
Cash (4.5.2) —Resources only at any time that the giving or receiving Faction is executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event. All
negotiations are open. The rules do not bind players to agreements.

A Faction Controls a Province or City if its pieces there exceed
those of all other Factions combined. (If none does, the space is
uncontrolled.) Casinos count only if open (1.4.4). Control affects
certain Faction activities and victory. Adjust Control markers to show
a Faction’s control as it changes due to Operations (3.0), Special
Activities (4.0), Events (5.0), voluntary force removal (1.4.1), or
the Propaganda Round (6.0).

1.6 Support and Opposition

1.8 Resources and Aid

Support and Opposition affect victory and some actions.
1.6.1 Cities and Provinces always show 1 of 5 levels of its populace’s
Support for or Opposition to the Government that can shift during play:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Active Support.
Passive Support.
Neutral.
Passive Opposition.
Active Opposition.

1.6.2 Show Active or Passive Support or Opposition with markers
placed at each City or Province. Show Neutral spaces by the absence
of such markers. Active Support/Opposition counts double for Total
Support/Opposition.

At any moment, each
Faction has between 0
and 49 Resources that it
uses to pay for Operations (3.0). During Propaganda Rounds (6.2.1) and Events, a level
of Aid (0 to 49) adds to Government Resources. Mark Resources
and Aid on the edge track—for Resources, with a cylinder of the
Faction’s color (1.5). Negotiated transfer of Resources (1.5.1) may
only be to or from a Faction executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event (per 2.3).

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions on the back page of this rule book to decide
upon various play options, assign Factions to players, prepare the
deck, and set up markers and forces.
NOTE: ECs (1.3.4) have no Population and never hold Support or
Opposition.
1.6.3 Victory Markers. Various totals affect
victory (7.0). Adjust the following markers
on the numbered edge track per the box
below as any changes in these totals occur:

•	 Government victory depends on the total value of population in
Support—“Total Support”—per the box below.
•	 26July victory similarly depends on Opposition plus the number
of 26July Bases on the map—“Opposition + Bases”.

Short Game Option: Set aside 8 random Event cards, face
down, then prepare the deck.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of the
draw deck. The card on the played card pile is played first; the card
on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE: Players will
see one card ahead into the deck (2.3.8). All played cards and the
number of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.

Cuba Libre
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the Sequence
of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Propaganda Rounds [6.0],
advance the Card marker).

2.3 Event Card

When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event; other Factions may Pass and collect Resources.

•	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of the Faction symbols shown at
the top of the card.
•	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event
on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card
in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.7). Factions that did are Ineligible. (All
Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free Operations, 3.1.2.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost symbol
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible to
execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost is the
2nd Eligible.
Faction
Order

NOTE: Gray halos around some Faction symbols relate only to
Non-player instructions (8.4.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction opts to Pass, it receives
+1 Resources (or +3 Resources if Government) and remains Eligible
for the next card. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the
Passing Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives
the same options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible
Faction Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.
2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.

FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass (2.3.3),
it may execute either:
•	 An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—
or
•	 The Event shown on the card.

5

2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation (LimOp) is an
Operation in just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited
Operation is a Garrison (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2),
it can involve pieces from multiple spaces but only 1 destination
space. A Limited Operation counts as an Operation. See also Final
Event Card (2.3.9) and Non-player Operations (8.1).
2.3.6 Launder. Whenever a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction pays Resources to execute an Operation (including a Limited Operation,
2.3.5) but executes no Special Activity, it may remove a Cash marker
that it owns (4.5.2) to immediately execute an additional, free, Limited Operation of any type except Construct (3.3.5). Alternatively, a
different Faction may remove its own Cash marker to enable the 1st
or 2nd Eligible Faction to execute such a free Operation. A Faction
may only benefit from 1 such Cash marker per card.
EXAMPLE: The Syndicate after executing a Rally removes a Cash
marker, then executes a March to 1 space at no Resource cost.
DESIGN NOTE: The free LimOp reflects the use of a stash of cash
to heighten an operation’s tempo.
2.3.7 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events
(or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders
on the Sequence of Play Track as follows:
•	 Any Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event this card
(and not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
•	 Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event this card to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise specified by the Event; see also Free Operations, 3.1.2.).

2.3.8 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw deck’s
next card. Play the card on the played card pile, proceeding with the
appropriate sequence.
Sudden Propaganda Option: For less foreknowledge, if all
players agree at Setup (2.1), whenever the next card is revealed
as Propaganda, instead switch the places of the 2 showing
cards and conduct an immediate Propaganda Round (6.0). The
switched Event card will be the first card of the next Campaign
(unless the game ends that Round). Ignore rule 2.3.9 below
regarding the Final Event Card.

OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction does
not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation and possibly
the Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
•	 Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
•	 Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction may
instead execute the Event.
•	 Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd
Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special Activity
if desired.
NOTE: For ease of reference, these options are illustrated on the
Sequence of Play aid sheet and on the game board.

2.3.9 Final Event Card. On the last Event card before the final
Propaganda Card (2.4.1), any player Operations must be Limited
(2.3.5, no Special Activities).

2.4 Propaganda Card

If playing a Propaganda Card, conduct a Propaganda Round (6.0).
2.4.1 Final Propaganda. If there is no victory in the 4th Propaganda
card’s Victory Phase (6.1), continue through the Support Phase (only,
6.3.5) and end the game: determine victory by 7.3.

PLAY NOTE: Set aside Propaganda cards to show how many have
gone by. Each series of Event cards up to a Propaganda Round is
called a “Campaign”.

3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General

The Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction aid sheet and, if applicable, selects the
map spaces to be involved. The Faction usually pays a cost in Resources (not Aid,1.8), often per space selected; it must have enough
Resources to pay for the Operation, including in each selected space.
A given space may be selected only once for a given Operation.
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which the
Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions or pieces to be affected
(targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed or replaced. A single
Operation may target one or more Factions and ignore others. Once
targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent
possible (1.4.1).
3.1.1 Pawns. Players may mark spaces selected for Operations (3.0)
or Special Activities (4.0) with white or black pawns. (The pawns
are for convenience, not a limit on the number of spaces that may
be selected.)
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) or Laundering Cash
(2.3.6) grant free Operations or Special Activities: they cost no
Resources and, if executed by a Faction other than the one playing
an Event, could leave it Eligible (2.3.7). Other requirements and
procedures still apply unless trumped by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).
Construct Operations are never free (3.3.5).

3.2 COIN Operations

The Government chooses from Train, Garrison, Sweep, and
Assault Operations.
3.2.1 Train. Training Operations augment Government forces and
possibly build Support (1.6). Select any Provinces or Cities and
pay 2, 3, or 4 Resources per selected space according to the US
Alliance track (6.3.1).
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected Province with a Government
Base AND in each selected City, place up to 4 cubes (any combination of Available Troops and Police). Then, in up to 1 selected
space, either:

•	 Replace any 2 cubes with 1 Government Base (within
stacking,1.4.2), OR
•	 Conduct Civic Action (6.3.2) to build Support. As during the
Support Phase, the Government must have Troops, Police, and
Control (1.7) in the space and must pay added Resources per 6.3.2
(even if Training was free).

3.2.2 Garrison. Garrison Operations protect ECs by moving Troops
or Police to them and finding and removing Guerrillas there. Pay 2,
3, or 4 Resources total (not per space) according to the US Alliance
track (6.3.1). If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must
end on a single destination space.
PROCEDURE: Move any number of cubes from any spaces to any
ECs or Cities. Then, in each EC (whether or not a cube just moved
there and even if the Garrison is a Limited Operation [2.3.5]),
Activate 1 Guerrilla for each cube there. Then, if desired, Assault
(3.2.4) in 1 EC at no added cost. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the
Assault must be in the destination EC.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweep Operations may move Troops (typically, into
contested areas) and also can locate enemy Guerrillas. Select any
Cities or Provinces as destinations. Pay 2, 3, or 4 Resources per
space according to the US Alliance track (6.3.1).
PROCEDURE: First, move any adjacent Troops desired into selected spaces.

•	 Then, in selected spaces other than Forest, Activate 1 Guerrilla
(1.4.3) for each cube there (Police plus Troops, whether they just
moved or were already there).
•	 In Forest spaces, Activate only 1 Guerrilla for every 2 cubes
(round odd cubes down).
3.2.4 Assault. Assault Operations eliminate Insurgent forces. Select
any spaces and pay 2, 3, or 4 Resources per space according to the
US Alliance track (6.3.1).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove 1 Active Guerrilla
(1.4.3) for each Troops cube there. Once a targeted Faction has no
Guerrillas in the space, remove (or close, 1.4.5) its Bases instead.

•	 In a City or EC, also remove 1 enemy piece for each Police there.
•	 In Mountain, instead remove only 1 piece for every 2 Troops
(rounded down).
SEIZURE: If a Cash marker was removed (4.5.2), place it with a
cube in the space.

DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less militarily capable than Government forces but enjoy an information advantage in that Government
Operations generally must first Sweep to Activate (locate) them
before Assaulting them.
NOTE: The Faction aid sheets use the phrase “Bases last” to remind
that an Operation cannot remove an enemy Base as long as Guerrillas (Active or Underground), Troops, or Police of the same Faction
remain in the same space. All of a Faction’s Guerrillas in a space
may be Underground, preventing further removal via Assault of its
pieces (including Bases) until the Guerrillas are Activated.

3.3 Insurgent Operations

Insurgent Factions choose from Rally, March,
Terror, and (for 26July and Directorio) Attack or (for Syndicate)
Construct Operations.
NOTE: On the Faction aid sheets under “Insurgent Operations”,
the terms “Guerrillas” and “Bases” mean those of the executing
Faction (friendly), unless otherwise specified.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment or recover friendly forces.
Select any Provinces or Cities. Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
•	 26July may only select spaces at Neutral or Opposition, not those
with Support (1.6).

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Cuba Libre
•	 Directorio may only select Neutral or Passive spaces, not those
with Active Support or Active Opposition.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction places
1 of its Available Guerrillas. 26July or Directorio may instead replace
2 of their Guerrillas with 1 of their Bases, within stacking (1.4.2).
If the space already has any of the executing Faction’s Bases (for
Syndicate, open Casino, 1.4.4), the Faction may instead:

•	 Flip all its Guerrillas there Underground (any Faction,1.4.3)
OR
•	 If 26July, place a number of its Available Guerrillas up to twice
the number of its Bases there plus twice the space’s Population
value (1.3.2-.3).
•	 If Directorio, place a number of its Available Guerrillas up to the
number of its Bases there plus the space’s Population value.
3.3.2 March. March moves friendly Guerrillas. Pay 1 Resource per
final destination City or Province (0 Resources to move to ECs).
If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving Guerrillas must end in a
single destination space.
NOTE: Guerrillas must enter a new space in order to benefit from
an Event effect that calls for a March first (“Armored Cars”, “El
Che”, or “The Twelve”)—representing the advantages of fast-moving light units.

PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas desired into adjacent spaces. No Guerrilla moves more than
once. Guerrillas moving from a space to the same final destination
move as a single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving group to Active
(1.4.3) if:

•	 They enter a City or Province with Support (1.6) or an EC
AND
•	 The moving group’s number of Guerrillas plus the number of
cubes in the entered space exceeds 3.

7

3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces; particularly successful attacks augment friendly Guerrillas (by capturing
enemy weapons, equipment, rations, or recruits). Select any spaces
where the executing Faction—it must be 26July or Directorio—has
at least 1 Guerrilla and 1 enemy piece; pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less than
or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas there
(whether or not they began Active), remove or close (1.4.5) up to 2
enemy pieces (executing Faction’s choice; may include Underground
Guerrillas). The 2 pieces may belong to different Factions.
•	 Attack cannot remove a targeted Faction’s Base before all that
Faction’s cubes or Guerrillas in the space.
•	 Attack cannot close Casinos if any Syndicate Guerrillas, Troops,
or Police remain in the space.
NOTE: Government forces thus protect Syndicate Casinos from
Insurgent Attack.
CAPTURED GOODS: If the roll was a “1”, place 1 of the executing Faction’s Available Guerrillas (1.4.1) there. If a Cash marker
was removed (4.5.2), place it in the space with a Guerrilla of the
executing Faction.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Provinces
or Cities neutralize (or, for 26July, build)
Support or Opposition (1.6) and place Terror
markers that hinder future efforts to influence
it. In ECs, they place Sabotage markers that block Government
Resource earnings (6.2.1). Select any spaces where the executing
Faction has at least 1 Underground Guerrilla; pay 1 Resource per
City or Province (0 for ECs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 friendly Underground Guerrilla in each
selected space.

•	 If the space is a Province or City, place a Terror marker and shift
any Support or Opposition 1 level toward Neutral (remove Passive
or shift Active to Passive and adjust Total Support or Opposition,
1.6) OR, if 26July, toward Active Opposition.
•	 If the space is an EC without a Sabotage marker, place a Sabotage
marker.
•	 Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on the
map. (There are 20.)
NOTE: Several Terror markers may occupy a Province or City; only
1 Sabotage marker may occupy an EC.

EXAMPLE: A group of 2 Underground 26July Guerrillas March
from Sierra Maestra to Oriente, which has Passive Support and
where there are 1 Police and 1 Troops cubes. Because the destination
is a Province with Support and the total of 4 cubes and moving Guerrillas involved exceeds 3, the 2 moving Guerrillas flip to Active.

3.3.5 Construct. Construct Operations—executed only by the Syndicate—build new Casinos or open closed ones. Select any Cities or
Provinces that either the Government or the Syndicate Controls (1.7);
pay 5 Resources per space (Construct is never free, 2.3.6, 3.1.2).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either place a closed Casino
(within stacking, 1.4.2) or open a closed Casino (1.4.4).

NOTE: March often Activates Guerrillas, but most non-March moves
by Event (5.0) do not.

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

4.3 26July Special Activities

4.1 Special Activities in General

When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes
an Operation in at least 1 space (3.0), it may also execute 1 type of
its Special Activities (Exception: Limited Operations, 2.3.5). Some
Events grant free Special Activities (3.1.2).
•	 As with Operations, the executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or pieces affected and the order of actions. A Faction may
execute its Special Activity at any one time immediately before,
during, or immediately after the execution of its Operation.
EXAMPLE: 26July with 0 Resources Kidnaps to pay for the necessary accompanying Terror thereafter (4.1.1).
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity,
the 2nd Eligible will have the option of executing the card’s Event
(2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities may take place only in the locations of
their Accompanying Operations. If not otherwise specified, Special
Activities may accompany any Operations and take place in any
otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 Government Special Activities

The Government may choose from Transport, Air Strike,
or Reprisal Special Activities.
4.2.1 Transport. Transport moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move up to 3 Troops from a City or Base to any
1 other space.
4.2.2 Air Strike. An Air Strike destroys an exposed Insurgent unit.
It may only accompany Garrison, Sweep, or Assault (3.2.2-.4) and
occur in a Province or EC (not City). It may not occur if US Alliance
is Embargoed (6.3.1).
PROCEDURE: Remove 1 Active Guerrilla or, if the targeted Faction
has no Guerrillas in the space, remove or close 1 of its Bases.
4.2.3 Reprisal. Reprisal reduces Opposition and displaces Guerrillas. It may only accompany Garrison, Sweep, or Assault (3.2.2-.4)
and occur in 1 Govt-Controlled space (1.7).
PROCEDURE: Place a Terror marker in the selected space. Shift
Opposition (if any) 1 level toward Neutral. Relocate 1 Guerrilla
from there to an adjacent space.

26July may choose from Infiltrate, Ambush, or Kidnap
Special Activities.
4.3.1 Infiltrate. Infiltration replaces Government forces with 26July
Guerrillas. It may only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2). It may
occur in any 1 space without Support (including an EC) that has or
is adjacent to an Underground 26July Guerrilla.
PROCEDURE: Remove or replace 1 cube in the space—Police, if
any there, otherwise Troops—with a 26July Guerrilla.
COMMANDEER: Place any Cash removed (4.5.2) with a 26July
Guerrilla in the space.
4.3.2 Ambush. An Ambush enables 26July to ensure the complete
success of an Attack in 1 space. It must take place in a space selected
for Attack (3.3.3, not yet resolved) and that has at least 1 Underground 26July Guerrilla (1.4.3).
PROCEDURE: Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3), the
Attack in that space Activates 1 Underground Guerrilla only and
automatically succeeds (do not roll; remove the 2 enemy pieces
normally). Place an Available 26July Guerrilla in the space (Underground, 1.4.3) as if a “1” had been rolled.
4.3.3 Kidnap. Kidnapping takes variable amounts of Resources
(1.8) from the Government or the Syndicate or Cash (4.5.2) from
the Syndicate. It may take place in 1 space that:
•	 Was or will be selected for Terror (3.3.4) this Operation, AND
•	 Is a City, EC, or has an open Casino, AND
•	 Has more 26July Guerrillas than Police.

PROCEDURE: 26July targets the Syndicate in spaces with open
Casinos, the Government in Cities or ECs, or selects either in Cities
with open Casinos. Roll a die and transfer to 26July from the targeted
Faction a number of Resources equal to the die roll. Any Resources
transferred to 26July once they hold 49 are lost. If a targeted Faction
runs out of Resources, no more is transferred. Then close 1 open
Casino in the selected space (regardless of Faction targeted).
CASH RANSOM: If the targeted Faction has Cash (4.5.2) in the
space, transfer 1 Cash marker to a 26July Guerrilla there instead of
rolling for Resources.

4.4 Directorio Special Activities

Directorio may choose from Subvert, Ambush, or Assassinate Special Activities.
4.4.1 Subvert. Subversion earns Resources and/or sets a Province
to Neutral (representing help with the daily work of locals to turn
them away from the Government or the more radical 26July). It may
only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2) and occur in 1 Province
with DR Control.
PROCEDURE: Add the Province’s Population value to Directorio
Resources and set the space to Neutral (remove any Support or
Opposition).
4.4.2 Ambush. Directorio Ambushes the same as 26July (4.3.2) but
using Directorio instead of 26July forces.

It’s no problem—I’ve got transports, airstrikes and reprisals!

4.4.3 Assassinate. Assassination efficiently neutralizes an enemy
unit—even a protected Base. It may occur in any 1 space selected
for Directorio Terror (3.3.4) this Operation in which Directorio
Guerrillas outnumber Police.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Cuba Libre
PROCEDURE: Remove or close (1.4.5) any 1 enemy piece in that
space.
COMMANDEER: Place any Cash removed (4.5.2) with a Directorio
Guerrilla in the space.

4.5 Syndicate Special Activities

The Syndicate may choose from Profit, Muscle, or Bribe
Special Activities.
4.5.1 Profit. Profiting stashes Cash for laundering or exchanges
Cash or open Casinos for Resources. It may only accompany a
Rally, March, or Construct Operation (3.3.1-.2, -.5) and may occur
in any spaces with Syndicate-owned Cash (4.5.2) or open Casinos.

PROCEDURE: Place 1 available Cash marker (4.5.2) under any
Guerrilla or cube in each of 1 or 2 spaces with an open Casino.
Alternatively, close any Casinos desired and remove any Syndicate-owned Cash desired and add +3 Syndicate Resources for each
Casino closed and Cash marker removed (to a maximum 49).

DESIGN NOTE: Removal by Profit represents rapid, less efficient
laundering or liquidation of assets than during the Resource Phase.
4.5.2 Cash Markers. The game uses 4 Cash markers
to represent major stashes of loot—principally stacks
of US dollars—awaiting laundering or deposit in the
United States. The limit on play is 4 Cash markers
(any others provided are spares). On the map, they are always placed
beneath a Guerrilla or cube and move with it. That Guerrilla’s or
cube’s Faction owns the Cash. A piece may hold several Cash
markers. The owner may transfer the Cash to another Guerrilla or
cube in the same space at any time (even as the Guerrilla is removed
or replaced and including to another Faction’s piece). Cash is only
removed as follows:

•	 If a piece holding Cash is removed, the owner must immediately
transfer the Cash marker to another Guerrilla or cube or remove it.
•	 A Faction after executing Operations without a Special Activity
may remove a Cash marker it owns for a free, extra Limited
Operation (2.3.6).
•	 During the Resource Phase, all Cash is removed; each marker
provides the owner either a Base (for Syndicate, an open Casino)
or +6 Resources (6.2.4).
NOTE: See also Kidnap 4.3.3, Cash Ransom.

4.5.3 Muscle. Muscle relocates the Government’s Police or Troops,
usually to protect Syndicate Casinos or ECs. It may only accompany
a Rally, March, or Construct Operation (3.3.1-.2, -.5). The destination
is 1 space with an open Casino (1.4.4) or 1 EC.

9

5.0 EVENTS

Each Event bears a title, italicized flavor text, and Event text. Flavor
text is provided for historical interest and has no effect on play.

5.1 Executing Events

When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally (sometimes involving actions or decisions by other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction makes all
selections involved in implementing the text, such as which pieces
are affected.
EXAMPLE: The Government executes the unshaded text of “Eulogio Cantillo”. It would choose the space and which Faction would
March its Guerrillas. The Marching Faction would then choose the
March destination.

5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence. EXAMPLE: If the Event says that a Faction Ambushes in a
space, it does so even if all its Guerrillas there are already Active.
However:

•	 Events never place pieces that are not available (1.4.1); they
remove rather than replace if the replacement is not available;
they close rather than remove Casinos (1.4.5).
•	 Unless specified (EXAMPLE: “Sinatra”), Events may not violate
stacking (1.4.2).
•	 Events may not raise either Aid or a Faction’s Resources beyond
49 (1.8).
•	 Unless specified (EXAMPLE: “Fat Butcher”), Events do not
allow a Faction to execute an Operation or Special Activity type
available only to other Factions (3.0, 4.0).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence.
5.1.3 If even per the above not all of an executed Event’s text can
be carried out, implement that which can.

5.2 Dual Use

Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The
executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text to
carry out (not both). A player may select either text option regardless
of Faction.
NOTE: Shaded text typically favors the Government. Dual-use events
represent opposed effects of the same cause, forks in the historical
road, or instances subject to alternative historical interpretation.

PROCEDURE: Relocate 1 to 2 Police from any spaces to the
destination if it is a City or 1 to 2 Troops if it is a Province or EC.

NOTE: Police protect Casinos from Insurgent Attack, Kidnap, and
Assassination (3.3.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.3); Troops protect Casinos from
Attack (3.3.3) and ECs from Sabotage (6.2.1).
4.5.4 Bribe. Bribe neutralizes other Factions’ units or exposes or hides
Guerrillas but costs Resources (1.8). It may occur in any 1 space.

PROCEDURE: Reduce Syndicate Resources –3 and remove up to
2 cubes there, remove or flip up to 2 Guerrillas there, or remove an
enemy Base there. NOTE: Bribe is the only Special Activity with a
Resource cost. Bribe may remove one Guerrilla and flip another.
CONTRABAND: The Syndicate player may transfer any Cash
removed (4.5.2) by Bribe to any Guerrilla or cube in the space.

5.3 Insurgent Capabilities

Event text with a box marked “Insurgent Capability”
has lasting effects that either help or hurt one or more
Insurgent Factions. When executing such an Event,
place the corresponding marker in the Insurgent Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the rest of the game.

Keep track of the phases of the Propaganda Round
with the “Prop Card” marker and the Propaganda
Phase Track

5.4 Government Momentum

Event text with a box marked “Government Momentum” has lingering effects that help the Government. When executing such shaded
text, place the card in view near the Government corner of the board.
The effects last until the next Propaganda round’s Reset phase (6.5),
when the card is discarded. NOTE: Any number of Government
Momentum Events can be in play.

5.5 Free Operations

Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate
Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual sequence
of play and is free: it bears no Resource cost and does not affect
Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other requirements remain unless
trumped by Event text (5.1.1).
EXAMPLE: A free Ambush must Activate an Underground Guerrilla
per 3.3.4 unless Event text specifies otherwise.

6.0 PROPAGANDA ROUNDS

6.2.2 Insurgent Earnings. Then, add to:

•	 26July—The number of its Bases.
•	 Directorio—The number of spaces where it has pieces.
•	 Syndicate—The Population of each City and the Econ of each
Unsabotaged EC where Syndicate Guerrillas outnumber Police,
plus twice the number of open Casinos.
DESIGN NOTE: The Directorio drew more expatriate support
than the strapped 26July. The Syndicate also represents investment
interests in Cuba’s non-tourism economy.
6.2.3 The Skim. For each space with any open Casinos, the Syndicate transfers 2 Resources to the Controlling Faction (if any other
than Syndicate; any over 49 are lost). If the “Santo” Insurgent
Capability is in effect (5.3), any Underground Syndicate Guerrilla
in a space prevents Skim there.
6.2.4 Cash Deposits. 26July, then Directorio, Government, and
Syndicate remove any Cash (4.5.2) that they own, selecting to
receive for each marker either an available Base (or open Casino)
of that Faction at the Cash’s location (within stacking, 1.4.2) or
+6 Resources. Syndicate may instead open a closed Casino at the
location. NOTE: Bases placed or Casinos opened at this point can
affect Control or Game End victory (1.7, 6.3.5, 7.3).

Conduct a Propaganda Round
in the sequence of phases in
this section as each Propaganda
Card is played. The Sequence of
Play sheet and board also list
this sequence.

Exception: Never conduct more
than 1 Propaganda Round in a
row (without at least 1 Event
card in between)—instead, additional Propaganda cards are
played without a Propaganda
Round. If such an additional
Propaganda is final (2.4.1), end
the game and determine victory
(7.3).

6.3 Support Phase

6.1 Victory Phase

•	 Firm: The US ships arms and trains the Cuban army. COIN
Operations (3.2) cost 2 Resources per space (or total, for
Garrison).
•	 Reluctant: The US dramatically cuts arms sales and discontinues
training programs. Scrutiny of the Batista Administration by
Congress and the US Media is severe. COIN Operations cost 3
Resources per space (or total, for Garrison).
•	 Embargoed: The US cuts off arms sales and discourages other
countries from delivering arms to Cuba; clandestine shipments
still arrive. COIN Operations cost 4 Resources per space (or total,
for Garrison). No Air Strikes (4.2.2).

The US Alliance is tested and Aid adjusted according to its level.
Then the Government and 26July may spend Resources to affect
Support and Opposition (1.6).
6.3.1 US Alliance. A US Alliance track shows 1 of 3
levels. If Total Support (1.6.3) is 18 or less, degrade
the US Alliance 1 box downward (if possible) and reduce Aid by –10 (even if already at Embargoed, to a
minimum of 0). The US Alliance level affects Government actions
as follows:

If all of any player’s Factions (or Non-player, 8.0) have met their
Victory conditions, the game ends. See Victory (7.0) to determine
winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue with the Propaganda
Round. After completing the final Propaganda card’s Round (2.4.1),
determine victory per 7.3.

6.2 Resources Phase

Add to Factions’ Resources per the following sequence, to a maximum of 49 (1.8).
6.2.1 Government Earnings. First, Sabotage any ECs where 26July
plus Directorio Guerrillas outnumber cubes. Then, add the total
Economic value (1.3.1.3) of ECs that have no Sabotage markers (8
minus the Econ of Sabotaged ECs) plus Aid.

NOTE: Events also can shift US Alliance but adjust Aid only as
specified in their text.
6.3.2 Civic Action. Government may spend any number of Resources to build Support in Govt-Controlled Cities or Provinces (1.7) that
have both Troops and Police.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Cuba Libre
•	 Every 4 Resources spent
removes 1 Terror marker
or—once no Terror is in
a space—shifts it 1 level
toward Active Support. (Adjust Total Support, 1.6.3.)

7.0 VICTORY

Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Faction aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

Whenever all of any player’s Factions (or Non-player, 8.0) pass
a victory check (7.2), or if none does by game end, the Faction
that reached the highest victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place,
2nd-highest comes in 2nd place, and so on. Ties go to Non-players
(8.0), then Syndicate, then Directorio, then 26July.

DESIGN NOTE: Troops and
Police together provide the
security needed to make gains
in popular support. See also
Training, 3.2.1.

7.2 During Propaganda Rounds

6.3.3 Agitation. 26July similarly may spend Resources
to encourage Opposition in
26July-Controlled Cities or
Provinces (1.7).

Check victory at the start of each Propaganda Round (6.1). Victory
conditions are:

•	 Every 1 Resource spent removes 1 Terror marker or—once no Terror is in a space—shifts
it 1 level toward Active Opposition. (Adjust Opposition+Bases,
1.6.3.)
6.3.4 Expat Backing. The Directorio now may free Rally (3.3.1)
in 1 space with neither Active Support, nor Active Opposition, nor
Control by any Faction other than DR (it may be Uncontrolled, 1.7).
(Adjust Control.)
6.3.5 Game End? If this Propaganda Round is final (2.4.1), the
game ends. See Victory (7.3). If not, continue with Redeploy and
Reset. NOTE: The final round omits Redeploy and Reset (6.4-6.5).
Closed Casinos (1.4.4) will remain closed; Troops will remain in
Provinces.

6.4 Redeploy Phase

The Government relocates its forces as follows.
6.4.1 The Government may move any Police to any ECs or GovtControlled spaces (1.7).
6.4.2 The Government must move any Troops on ECs or in Provinces without Government Bases to Govt-Controlled spaces (1.7)
that either are Cities or have Government Bases (if no such spaces,
then to Havana City).
6.4.3 The Government may move any other Troops to such GovtControlled Cities or Bases.

NOTE: The Government may carry out the above steps in any order.
Adjust Control markers at the end of these Redeployments.

6.5 Reset Phase

Finally, prepare for the next card as follows:

11

•	 Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
•	 Remove Terror/Sabotage markers (3.3.4).
•	 Place any played Government Momentum cards onto the played
cards pile—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
•	 Flip all Guerrillas to Underground (1.4.3) and all Casinos to open
(1.4.4, adjust Open Casinos marker).
•	 Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s
new top card (2.3.8).

•	 Government: All Cities are at Active Support and Total Support
exceeds 18.
•	 26July: Total Opposition plus the number of 26July Bases exceeds
15.
•	 Directorio: Total Population in spaces Controlled by Directorio
(1.7) plus the number of Directorio Bases exceeds 9.
•	 Syndicate: Syndicate has more than 7 open Casinos and Resources above 30.
DESIGN NOTE: The 26July Movement won the Revolution by convincing most Cubans that they were the best choice after Batista’s
ouster. Had the Directorio controlled more territory, it might have
offered an alternative to Fidel Castro rather than being co-opted.

7.3 After Final Propaganda

If the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1) ends without a victory check
win (7.2), the player (or Non-player, 8.0) with the highest victory
margin (below: closest to or furthest beyond its victory condition)
wins.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
its endgame goal, negative or zero if it has not.
Victory margin:
•	 Government: Total Support – 18.
•	 26July: Total Opposition + 26July Bases – 15.
•	 Directorio: DR-Controlled Population + Directorio Bases – 9.
•	 Syndicate: Lower of open Casinos – 7 or Syndicate Resources
– 30.
Victory Deception Option: For less knowledge of how close
Factions in 3- or 4-player games are to winning, each player at
start blindly draws 2 Deception markers. Set aside the rest; they
may not be inspected. Players may reveal any of their Deception
markers only as they use them:
•	 Empty Threat: No effect (reveal at game end).

•	 Hidden Agenda: Permanently add +1 to the holding player’s
victory margin (7.3).
•	 Hidden Asset: Convert any 1 LimOp option (2.3.5) into a
full Op & Special Activity Option.

STOP!
You have read all rules needed for 4 players or the no Non-Player
option (1.5, recommended if playing the first time).

8.0 NON-PLAYER FACTIONS

This section modifies the above rules with priorities that govern
actions by any Factions beyond those represented by a player. The
Playbook features a 1-Player Example of Play illustrating these rules.
In games with 4 players or 2 or 3 players and the No Non-Players
Option (1.5), ignore this entire rules section!
NOTE: Non-player Factions do not act only in their own direct
interest. Like players, they sometimes help, sometimes hurt, one
another.

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

The Sequence of Play aid sheet summarizes the following rules in
gray text.

•	 Event or Ops? Except as specified below and in any special Event
Instructions (8.4.1), a Non-player Faction when given the option
(2.3.4) chooses the Event.
•	 2nd Eligible. In some games, Non-players choose Operations
and a Special Activity over Events when 2nd Eligible (2.3.2):
Syndicate and Government do so when the other of them is a
player; Directorio and 26July do so when the other of those two
is a player.
•	 Momentum. When any Momentum Event (5.4, including shaded
“Raúl”) is in effect, Non-player Government chooses Operations
and a Special Activity.
•	 Ineffective Events. Non-players only opt for Events that would
have an effect (something happens, including Capabilities, 5.3)
and for Momentum Events (5.4) when the next card showing is
not Propaganda.
•	 Operations Not Limited. Whenever a Non-player Faction is to
execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5), it instead executes a normal
Operation and (typically) Special Activity. Ignore the Final Event
Card restriction (2.3.9).
•	 Low Resources. When a Non-player Faction is to execute
Operations but has too few Resources to pay for any in even a
single non-EC space, it Passes instead (earning Resources, 2.3.3).
If a Non-player Faction runs out of Resources while executing
an Operation, it Operates in no further spaces that card (it may
execute a Special Activity).
•	 No Laundering. Non-player Factions may not receive Operations
from Cash (2.3.6).
INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: Non-player 26July is 1st Eligible for “Resistencia Cívica”. No Cities have Directorio pieces.
Because the text would have no effect, 26July executes Operations
and a Special Activity.
8.1.1 Operations, Special Activities, and Events. To execute a
Non-player Faction’s Operations and Special Activities or a specific Event, see the Non-Player flow charts and the relevant rules
below.

GUIDELINES: Carry out whatever actions apply to the maximum
extent (such as with the most pieces allowed and only as long as
needed pieces and Resources are available). Normal Resource costs,
requirements, and procedures still apply.

EXAMPLE: Non-Player Terror requires Activating an Underground
Guerrilla and costs 1 Resource per City or Province, per 3.3.4.
8.1.2 Procedure Guidelines. Unless otherwise specified, once
spaces involved are selected, Non-player Factions:

•	 Place friendly Bases whenever possible, including with Cash.
EXCEPTIONS: Government places only 1 Base per Province,
none in Cities; Syndicate if final Propaganda Round uses Cash
to open closed Casinos where possible.
•	 Place Police and Troops as evenly as possible, Police first.
•	 Place Cash with own Underground Guerrillas before Active
(4.5.2).
•	 Target or remove enemy players’ before Non-players’ pieces,
Bases (and Casinos) before other pieces, Police then Troops
evenly, and Underground before Active Guerrillas; otherwise
select randomly among enemy Factions. Remove pieces to be
replaced even if no pieces are available to replace them (1.4.1).
•	 Remove friendly Active before Underground Guerrillas, Troops
before Police. Transfer Cash about to be removed (4.5.2) to own
then another Non-player’s piece (Govt, then Syndicate, then DR,
then 26July), if possible. Voluntarily transfer nothing else.
•	 March so as to end up with as many Underground Guerrillas
as possible at the destination (3.3.2). Within that priority, move
Active first. Within those priorities for Guerrillas and in general
for cubes, move Cash first if to non-EC, last if to EC.
MARCH EXAMPLE: A group of Non-player Guerrillas is to March
into an otherwise empty space with Support. If any Guerrillas were
Underground, only 3 of them would move, first those Underground
and without Cash.
PLAY NOTE: Players may transfer (1.5.1) to Non-player Factions
normally.
8.1.3 Reading the Flowcharts. The Second Edition Non-Player
flowcharts show priorities with circled numbers (e.g., , , , )
and colored letters (e.g., , ) to indicate their order and nature:

•	 Numbered priorities (e.g., , ) are sequential priorities. Execute
the instructions in each sequential priority to the maximum extent
before moving to the next sequential priority (8.3). Some top-level
sequential priorities (black circles; e.g., , ,) contain further
sequential priorities (white circles; e.g., , ) that are parts of
and sequential steps to that top-level priority.
•	 Lettered priorities (e.g., , ) are nested priorities. Nested
priorities act as tie breakers within the sequential priorities to
which they are ordained. Each nested priority further narrows the
thus-far selected set of spaces or targets. For readability, nested
priorities have a shaded background.

8.2 Random Cities and Provinces

If several candidate spaces have equal priority for a Non-player
Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select a City or Province using
the Random Spaces table:
•	 Roll the green and yellow dice and refer to the table: green shows
column, yellow row.
•	 If the resulting space is not a candidate, follow the arrows until
one is reached, if necessary from Oriente to Havana (or follow
the arrows on the Random Spaces Map).
•	 Carry out as much of the action as possible in the candidate
reached, then roll again to select another, if needed.
NOTE: Players may agree to use an equal-chance die roll to choose
among a few spaces.

8.3 Random ECs

If only ECs are candidates, roll on the Random EC table. Sabotage
only unSabotaged ECs.

8.4 Non-Player Events

NOTE: Events will not always benefit the executing Non-player
Faction directly.
Halo

8.4.1 Event Instructions. Whenever any Non-player Faction is to
execute an Event and that Faction’s symbol on the card has a gray
halo, first check any special instructions for that Event at the bottom
of that Faction’s sheet.
8.4.2 Dual Use. Non-player Directorio and 26July executing a
Dual-Use Event (5.2) use unshaded text, Non-player Syndicate
and Government use shaded, unless otherwise specified in Event
Instructions (8.4.1).
8.4.3 Placement. Place, remove, or relocate as many pieces (per
8.1.2) as the Event, availability (1.4.1), and stacking (1.4.2) allow.
8.4.4 Who and Where. Unless otherwise specified:

•	 When there is a choice of who gets Event benefits (such as placing
pieces or free Operations), select the executing Faction, then
another random Non-player Faction.
•	 For free Operations or Special Activities, use that Faction’s
priorities (8.5-8.8).
•	 Select Event spaces to ensure that as many Bases and then other
pieces as possible are placed, removed, or replaced, then for the
greatest change in Total Support and Opposition.
•	 Otherwise, select spaces randomly (8.2-.3).

8.5 Non-Player Syndicate Actions

NOTE: It is not necessary to master the rules below for
specific Factions because they are summarized on the Non-player
foldout.
8.5.1 Rally. If Syndicate could Rally to add a Guerrilla to a space
with a Casino (open or closed) but no Syndicate Guerrillas, Rally:

•	 First place 1 Guerrilla in each space with any Casinos and no
Syndicate Guerrillas.
•	 Then, in any spaces with an open Casino, a cube, and where
all Syndicate Guerrillas are Active, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.5.5.

8.5.2 March. If Rally conditions (8.5.1) are not met and the priorities below would result in a March to an EC or with Cash, instead
March:
•	 First, with 1 Syndicate Guerrilla each to all ECs that can be reached
and are empty of pieces, within that, first from spaces with the
most Syndicate Guerrillas, then from where no open Casino.
•	 Then, if the next Propaganda card will be final (2.4.1), with any
Guerrillas holding Cash in spaces with no closed Casinos to any
closed Casinos that they can reach.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.5.5.

8.5.3 Construct. If neither Rally (8.5.1) nor March (8.5.2) conditions
are met and the number of Available plus Closed Casinos exceeds
Cash markers out on the map, or if a Terror Operation was selected

13

but none of its instructions could be executed, instead Construct
(where Govt or Syndicate Control):

•	 If Syndicate Resources exceed 35, Construct in 2 spaces, otherwise
in only 1.
•	 If the next Propaganda card will be the final one (2.4.1), open
closed Casinos, where Syndicate holds no Cash.
•	 Then, or if the next Propaganda will not be final, place new closed
Casinos, within that, first with other Casinos.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.5.5.

IF NONE: If no Casinos or fewer than 5 Resources are available,
instead execute Terror (8.5.4) or, if no Terror possible, Pass.
8.5.4 Terror. If no other Operation’s conditions are met (8.5.1-.2),
execute Terror (with Underground Guerrillas, 3.3.4):
•	 First, if 26July is a player and at victory (7.2), in 1 space with
Opposition.
•	 Then, if Government is a player and at victory, in 1 space with
Support.
•	 If neither applies, in 1 City or Province with either Opposition or
Support (not Neutral or EC).
Then Bribe per 8.5.5.

IF NONE: If there are no Underground Syndicate Guerrillas on the
map, instead Construct (8.5.3) or, if that not possible, Pass.
8.5.5 Special Activities. If Non-player Syndicate executed Rally,
March, or Construct, next execute Profit if possible per the following, otherwise Muscle or, if that not possible, Bribe. If it executed
Terror, Bribe.
PROFIT: Place up to 2 Cash markers with Syndicate
Guerrillas at open Casinos (4.5.1) within that:
•	 Where Syndicate holds no Cash.
•	 Then where no other Faction has pieces.

If no Cash available or no Syndicate Guerrilla is at an open Casino,
instead Muscle as follows.
MUSCLE: Move 2 cubes (Troops if to Province, Police if to City,
4.5.3) to a space with an open Casino and 26July Control or, if none,
DR Control. Take the cubes from a space with the most cubes. If
there is no such Casino space, instead Bribe as follows.
BRIBE: If it is possible to remove an enemy’s pieces to transfer Cash
to the Syndicate, pay –3 Syndicate Resources to do so, selecting
the space and then targeting randomly if several candidates. If not,
remove 26July then DR piece(s) (Base first, 8.1.2) from a space with
an open Casino. If there are none, instead remove 26July then DR
piece(s) from a space with any Syndicate piece (EC last, 8.2-.3).
If the “Mafia Offensive” Capability is in effect (5.3), if possible
Assassinate in a Terror space (per 8.1.2) instead of Bribing, using
the same priorities. If none of that is possible or if the Syndicate has
too few Resources, execute no Special Activity.

8.6 Non-Player Directorio Actions

8.6.1 Terror. If Directorio could execute Terror in a space
at either Active Support or Active Opposition or Assassinate to remove a Government Base, Terror in these spaces (with Underground
Directorio Guerrillas per 3.3.4):
•	 First, where Active Support.
•	 Then, where Active Opposition.

Cuba Libre

•	 Finally, at 1 (other) Assassination target, within that, first a Government Base, then any player’s Base, then any other target.
ASSASSINATE: Then Assassinate in a space where Terror occurred
and Directorio Guerrillas outnumber Police (4.4.2). Select the space
and target to remove a Base or close a Casino if possible, then to take
Cash, then some other piece. Within that, first target the Government
(Police before Troops, 8.1.2), then any player, then any Non-player.
•	 If there is no such space or no suitable target, execute no Special
Activity.

8.6.2 Rally. If Terror conditions are not met and Directorio has at
least 6 Guerrillas available or would place a Base with Rally, Rally
in these (Neutral or Passive) Provinces or Cities (3.3.1):
•	 First, in any with Directorio Guerrillas all of which are Active, a
Directorio Base, and any cubes, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
•	 Then, in others with at least 3 Directorio Guerrillas and room for
a DR Base (1.4.2), replace 2 Guerrillas with a Base.
•	 Then place Guerrillas in any others with Directorio Bases (Population plus Bases, 3.3.1), then with other DR Guerrillas, and
finally in 1 other (random) City or Province.
SUBVERT: Then Subvert (in a Province with DR Control, 4.4.1).

•	 If 26July is at victory (7.2), in a Province to remove the most
Opposition possible.
•	 If not, to remove the most Support possible.
•	 If neither possible, in a highest Population Province, within that,
first in a Neutral Province.
•	 If no Provinces are DR-Controlled, Directorio executes no Special
Activity.
IF NONE: If Rally is not possible (all Population is at Active Support or Opposition), March.
EXPAT BACKING: During the Support Phase, free Rally (6.3.4) to
place Guerrillas to gain DR Control of the most Population possible,
a Base if none, or Guerrillas at random if not possible.
8.6.3 March. If neither Terror nor Rally conditions (8.6.1-.2) are
met and there is no space with DR Guerrillas where removing 1 or 2
enemy pieces would add DR Control, or a Rally or Attack Operation
was selected but none of its instructions could be executed, March
as follows without removing DR Control or the last DR Guerrilla
from any origin space (and per 8.1.2):
•	 First, with just as many DR Guerrillas as needed to add DR
Control to the highest Population City or Province possible, first
from spaces with the most DR Guerrillas.
•	 Then, from 1 space with most DR Guerrillas who could move but
have yet to do so, to a space closer to Havana (including Havana).
•	 If the “Morgan” Capability is in effect (5.3), March from within
2 spaces.
Then Subvert per 8.6.2.

IF NONE: If such March possible, Attack.
8.6.4 Attack. If neither Terror nor Rally conditions (8.6.1-2) are met
and DR Guerrillas could Attack to remove 1 or 2 enemy pieces from
a space to add DR Control (NOTE: DR could not Attack 26July if
“Pact of Caracas” in effect), or a March Operation was selected
but none of its instructions could be executed, instead Attack in up
to 3 spaces (with an enemy, 3.3.3):

•	 Attack using Ambush in just 1 space where at least 1 Underground
Directorio Guerrilla (if able).
•	 Then Attack in additional spaces with at least 4 DR Guerrillas
total.
•	 Among spaces above and, once the spaces are selected, within each
space, target enemies so as to take any Cash (target Non-players
only if they could not transfer the Cash to another Non-player per
8.1.2), within that, first any player at victory (7.2), within that,
first Government, within that, first Syndicate, lastly 26July (per
8.1.2).
AMBUSH: Ambush (per 4.4.1, with an Underground Directorio
Guerrilla) in the first Attack space selected above (against the
Attack target).

•	 If none has an Underground DR Guerrilla, Directorio executes
no Special Activity.
IF NONE: If no such Attack can target appropriate pieces, March
instead (8.6.3) or, if no such March possible, Pass.
8.6.5 Caracas. If the “Pact of Caracas” Capability is in effect (5.3),
26July is a player and meeting its victory condition (7.2), and DR
has at least 2 Bases while executing an Operation or Event, remove
2 DR Bases from random space(s) to cancel “Caracas” (1.4.1).

8.7 Non-Player 26July Actions

8.7.1 Terror. If 26July could execute any Terror that enables
Kidnap, Sabotage, or a shift in Support/Opposition, do so (with
Underground 26July Guerrillas, 3.3.4):
•	 First, in 1 space where Kidnap against a Faction with Cash or more than
0 Resources would be possible (where 26July Guerrillas outnumber
Police, 4.3.3)—first an EC, then a City, then at an open Casino.
•	 Then at all other unSabotaged ECs.
•	 Then in each City and Province that is at Support or Neutral.
•	 Then, if “Pact of Caracas” is not in effect (5.3), in each other space
at Passive Opposition.
KIDNAP: Then Kidnap (4.3.3) in a space selected for Terror:

•	 Take Cash if possible.
•	 Otherwise, target a Faction with more than zero Resources,
Government if possible, then Syndicate.
•	 If the “Raúl” Capability (5.3) is in effect, reroll a Kidnap roll of
“1” or “2” (only).
•	 If Terror spaces have no Kidnap targets, 26July executes no Special Activity.
IF NONE: If the only Terror shift would be at Passive Opposition
without “Caracas”, Rally.

8.7.2 Rally. If no such effective Terror possible (8.7.1) and 26July
has at least 6 Guerrillas available or could Rally to place a Base, or
a Terror Operation was selected but none of its instructions could
be executed, Rally in Provinces and Cities (without Support, 3.3.1):

•	 First, in any with 26July Guerrillas all of which are Active, a
26July Base, and any cubes, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
•	 Then, wherever at least 3 26July Guerrillas and room for a 26July
Base (1.4.2), replace 2 Guerrillas with a Base.
•	 Then place Guerrillas wherever 26July Bases, then with other
26July Guerrillas, and finally in 1 (random) City or Province.
•	 If “The Guerrilla Life” in effect (5.3), combine flipping and
placement wherever possible.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Cuba Libre
INFILTRATE: Then Infiltrate (a space with a cube, without Support,
and with or adjacent to an Underground 26July Guerrilla, 4.3.1).
•	 At an EC, if possible.
•	 Within that or if not possible, to take Cash, if possible.
•	 Within that, to remove the last Police cube from a space, if
possible.
•	 Within that, in a random space.
•	 If there is no space to Infiltrate, 26July executes no Special Activity.

IF NONE: If Rally is not possible (all Cities and Provinces have
Support), instead March.
8.7.3 March. If neither Terror nor Rally conditions (8.7.1-.2) are
met and no space has 4 or more 26July Guerrillas and a Government
piece, or a Rally Operation was selected but none of its instructions
could be executed, March, without removing the last 26July Guerrilla
from any space (or violating 8.1.2):
•	 First, to get 1 Underground 26July Guerrilla onto each EC possible
that has none.
•	 Then, into 1 Govt-Controlled space, first 1 with Support, with
Guerrillas from all adjacent Opposition spaces and ECs.
•	 If the “El Che” Capability (5.3) is in effect, reverse the above
order.
•	 Then, from 1 space with the most 26July Guerrillas who could
move but have yet to do so, to a space closer to Havana City
(including into Havana).
Then Infiltrate per 8.7.2.

IF NONE: If no such March possible, Attack.
8.7.4 Attack. If neither Terror nor Rally (8.7.1-.2) conditions are met
and there is a space with at least 4 26July Guerrillas and a cube, or
a March Operation was selected but none of its instructions could
be executed, Attack (with 26July Guerrillas in spaces with enemy
pieces, 3.3.3).
•	 First in 1 City or Province with an Underground 26July Guerrilla
(that is, where 26July could then Ambush).
•	 Then wherever 4 or more 26July Guerrillas.
•	 For all Attack spaces above, select first a space with an enemy
from which 26July could take Cash. The or within that, to Attack
Government pieces, within that, to remove Control of the space
from a player (not Non-player) Faction.
•	 If the “Raúl” Capability (5.3) is in effect, reroll all failed Attacks
(only).
AMBUSH: Ambush (per 4.3.2, with an Underground 26July Guerrilla as part of the Attack) in the first Attack space selected above.

•	 If none has an Underground 26July Guerrilla, execute no Special
Activity.
IF NONE: If no such Attack can target Cash or Government pieces,
Pass.
8.7.5 Agitate. Non-player 26July Agitates (6.3.3) to the maximum
extent possible. If 26July has too few Resources to Agitate everywhere, it Agitates first where highest Population, then where Support,
then where fewest Terror markers, then randomly. Remove Terror
only if a shift would be achieved.

15

8.7.6 Caracas. If the “Pact of Caracas” Capability is in effect (5.3),
the DR is a player and meeting its victory condition (7.2), and 26July
has at least 2 Bases while executing an Operation or Event, remove
2 26July Bases from random space(s) to cancel “Caracas” (1.4.1).

8.8 Non-Player Government Actions

8.8.1 Momentum. If any of the following Momentum
Events are in effect (5.4), a Non-player Government first follows
these priorities:

•	 Armored Cars. Always Assault if it would be possible to remove
a 26July Base or any 4 or more Guerrillas, moving Troops by
Sweep priorities, disregarding adjacency.
•	 Sánchez Mosquera. Always Assault if it would be possible
to remove a 26July Base or any 4 or more Guerrillas from
Mountain.
•	 Rolando Masferrer. Unless already executing Assault, Sweep
and free Assault if it would be possible to remove a 26July Base
or Activate 4 or more Guerrillas.
•	 S.I.M. If Sweeping (8.8.4), instead of first doing so where cubes,
do so first where no cubes and, if into a space, take in half (rounded
up) Police, half Troops.
•	 Guantánamo Bay. If a Government Operation just undertaken
could add an Air Strike to remove 2 pieces, do so.
8.8.2 Train. If any space with a Government Base or any City lacks
either Govt Control, Troops, or Police, Train in spaces costing up
to 9 Resources:

•	 Until there are fewer than 4 cubes available, place 4 cubes (per
8.1.2) in each City and Government Base space, first where there
is no Govt Control, then where there are no Police, then where
there are no Troops.
•	 Then, in 1 Province that has at least 2 cubes, no Government
Base, and room to place one, replace 2 Troops then Police with
a Base.
•	 Finally, if no Base was placed, buy Civic Action in a Training space
where a Civic Action shift is possible (6.3.2) for the greatest shift
possible, without dropping Government Resources below 9.
NOTE: Non-player Government will Train, Sweep, or Assault up to
4 spaces at a time when the US Alliance is Firm (6.3.1), 3 spaces
when Reluctant, 2 spaces when Embargoed.
TRANSPORT: Then Transport up to 3 Troops from a City with
Govt Control and the most Troops beyond those needed for Control. Transport them to a Province that has Police but no Troops; if
none, to a space that has more Active Guerrillas than Troops; or,
if no such space, to a City or Province where another Faction has
Control and would lose it with the arrival of the Troops; finally, to
add Government Control where no Faction has Control.
•	 If not possible, execute no Special Activity.

IF NONE: If no such Train possible, Garrison.
8.8.3 Garrison. If the total of 26July and DR Guerrillas at an EC either include Underground or exceed cubes there, or a Train Operation
was selected but none of its instructions could be executed, Garrison.
Move Police then Troops to equal Guerrillas at all ECs, then to add
Govt Control or a Police or Troop to any Cities without. Take each
cube from a space with the most of that type, without removing
the last Police from any. Assault to remove the most 26July pieces.

16

Cuba Libre

AIR STRIKE: Then Air Strike, if possible to remove a Base or close
a Casino, then to remove a Guerrilla from a space with at least 1
cube, and then, to remove a Faction’s last Guerrilla from a space.
Within all the above, target first a player at victory, then 26July, then
DR, and then or within that, strike targets in Provinces before ECs.
If Embargoed (6.3.1) or there is no such Air Strike target, instead
execute Reprisal as follows.
REPRISAL: Execute Reprisal to move a Guerrilla where needed
and able to expose to accompanying Assault the Base of any player
who is at victory (7.2), then of 26July, then of the DR (only, without
preventing any adjacent Base from suffering Assault). Otherwise execute Reprisal to shift the highest Population space with Opposition
able (and move a Guerrilla from there, 4.2.3). Among Guerrillas,
choose Underground first, to a Neutral or Opposition space if possible. If no such target space, instead Transport per 8.8.2.
IF NONE: If no such Garrison possible, Sweep.
8.8.4 Sweep. If Garrison conditions (8.8.3) are not met and no 26July
or DR Base nor a total of 3 or more Guerrillas would be removed by
Assault (alone), or a Garrison Operation was selected but none of its
instructions could be executed, Sweep spaces for up to 9 Resources:
•	 Select Sweep spaces to Activate Underground 26July or DR
Guerrillas, first at Support, then in Havana City, then where there
are already cubes, then elsewhere.
•	 Also move in up to the Troops needed to Activate all Guerrillas
able and (if not already Govt Controlled) take Control, but without
losing Govt Control of any origin spaces.
•	 Activate all Guerrillas able in the above Sweep spaces, starting
with those of any players at victory (7.2), then 26July, then DR,
then Syndicate.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.8.3 (Air Strike, Reprisal, or
Transport).
IF NONE: If no such Sweep possible, Assault.
8.8.5 Assault. If Train and Garrison conditions (8.8.2-.3) are not
met and Assault with a Special Activity would add Govt Control
or remove a 26July or Directorio Base or at least 3 Guerrillas, or a
Sweep Operation was selected but none of its instructions could be
executed, select spaces costing up to 9 Resources to Assault:

•	 First execute a Special Activity per 8.8.3 (Air Strike, Reprisal, or
Transport).
•	 Then, if and only if the Syndicate is a player and meeting its
victory conditions (7.2), Assault to close all Casinos able.
•	 Finally, Assault in spaces to remove the most 26July or DR Bases
able, then to take any Cash possible, then to remove the most
Guerrillas possible. Within these priorities, select spaces first to
target 26July then DR then Syndicate.
IF NONE: If neither any such Assault nor Special Activity is possible, Pass. (If Government executed a Special Activity but cannot
Assault per above, pay for Assault in one space without removing
pieces, to enable the Special Activity per 4.1.).
8.8.6 Propaganda Civic Action. During the Support Phase, buy
all Civic Action (6.3.2) for the greatest shift in Opposition and
Support possible without dropping Government Resources below
9. EXCEPTION: In the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1), do so even
if Resources drop below 9.

8.8.7 Redeploy. Redeploy (6.4) only:

•	 Police to ECs to equal 26July Guerrillas there; then to Provinces
where Troops are about to Redeploy out, up to the number of
Police needed to keep Control (including after Reset opens any
closed Casinos); then 1 each to Cities and Government Bases
with no Police. Take each Police from the space with the most
Police without losing any Control or removing the last Police
from anywhere.
•	 Troops to distribute them as evenly as possible without losing any
Govt Control.

8.9 1-Player Victory

The player in a 1-player game (26July or Government) never wins
during Propaganda Rounds (7.2). To succeed, the player must avoid
any Non-player win and have the highest victory margin (7.3) after
the final Round. If not, the Non-player with the highest margin (ties
to Syndicate, then Directorio, then 26July) wins Cuba:

•	 If Syndicate—Viva Lansky! The Revolution is flickering out, as
is any semblance of Cuban sovereignty. Mob establishments span
the island. US law enforcement interest is intense, but the Cuban
dictatorship, US-owned businesses, and organized crime are
increasingly intertwined and their ability to defend their gangster
paradise interlocking.
•	 If Directorio—Student Revolution! People flock to the DR
banner, draining the Army and the 26July of fighters. Supporters
of the old regime flee, the Castros are hunted down as suspected
Soviet agents, and the United States recognizes the new
revolutionary government as representative of Cubans.
•	 If Non-Player 26July—Castro Triumph! Collecting the disparate
anti-regime forces around him, Fidel drives the old regime from
the island, then turns on and hunts down any and all competing
rebels. A very different Cuban dictatorship is at hand.
•	 If Non-Player Government—Rearguard Ascent! The Revolution
has failed. The population loses hope in the hapless rebels and
helps the Army and Police hunt them down. The Mob stays in
Cuba but learns its place. The Castros return to prison—there will
be no conciliatory release this time.
PLAYER VICTORY: If the player does survive to the final Round
with the highest victory margin, subtract the highest Non-player
margin from the player’s to find the degree of success:
•	 1 to 4—Stalemate! The battle for the island will be all out.
A prolonged Cuban Civil War is drawing increasing US
consideration of military intervention.
•	 5 or more, Player as Government—Model Counterinsurgency!
Against the odds, the Cuban dictatorship has shown how to
fight insurrection and foreign infiltration. Other Latin American
regimes study the success.
•	 5 or more, Player as 26July—Model Rebellion! The Castro-Guevara insurgent strategy has succeeded in Cuba’s divided society.
Leftists look to Cuba as mid-wife to revolution in Latin America
and beyond.
EXAMPLE: A solo 26July player avoids Non-player victory over 4
Propaganda Rounds. At game end, with 6 DR-Controlled Population
and 2 Directorio Bases on the map, DR has a –1 victory margin—the
highest of the Non-players. Total Opposition is 12 and 26July has
4 Bases out, so the player’s victory margin is +1: 2 above DR’s for
a “Stalemate”.

						               													<description>In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&amp;mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&amp;mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&amp;uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&amp;rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&amp;iacute;var.  Castro&amp;rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Castro&amp;rsquo;s Insurgency&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following up on GMT Games&amp;rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;26 July Movement&amp;rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&amp;rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COIN Series, Volume II&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&amp;mdash;both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&amp;mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&amp;rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&amp;rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&amp;mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; El Che and Ra&amp;uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&amp;mdash;will they help or hurt?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&amp;rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&amp;rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&amp;#10;&amp;hellip; and much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; It&amp;rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Syndicate&amp;rsquo;s bases are Casinos&amp;mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &amp;#10;&amp;bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&amp;rsquo;s hands&amp;mdash;even the corrupt Government&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&amp;mdash;reprisals&amp;mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&amp;mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.  Volume III is A Distant Plain&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan.  Volume IV is Fire in the Lake&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;Insurgency in Vietnam.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
