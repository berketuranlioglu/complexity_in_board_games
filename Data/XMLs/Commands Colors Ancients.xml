1. INTRODUCTION

The Commands & Colors: Ancients game system allows players to portray important engagements of ancient history. The
battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical
deployment of forces and important terrain features on the scale
of the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies
from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may
represent an entire legion of soldiers, while in other scenarios, a
unit may represent just a few brave warriors.

The Command card system drives movement, creates “fog of
war”, and presents players with many interesting challenges
and opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly
and efficiently. The battlefield tactics you will need to execute
to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and
limitations of the various ancient unit types, their weapons, the
terrain, and history.
In this core game of the series, we focus on battles involving
Rome and Carthage, with a few additional scenarios that pit
Carthage against other historic enemies. Additional expansion
modules are available to cover battles of Greeks, various Eastern
Kingdoms, Gauls, Celts, and many other situations, from the
struggles among Alexander’s Successors to the many civil wars
Rome was involved in. You will need this game in order to play
any of the expansions.
	 Welcome and Enjoy!

The battlefield gameboard (hereafter referred to as the battlefield)
is a hex grid, 13 hexes wide by 9 hexes deep. The battlefield is
divided into three sections by two dotted lines, giving each player
a left flank section, a center section and a right flank section.
Where the dotted line cuts through a hex, the hex is considered
to be part of both the flank section and the center section.

Terrain Tiles

These represent a wide range of terrain features and are placed
on the battlefield to recreate the historical battlefield for each
scenario. They are explained in detail later in the rules.

Command Cards

Units may only move or battle when given an order. Command
cards are used to order your troops to move, battle or do something special. For a description of all the Command cards, see
section 18.

Battle Dice

Each battle die has six blank indented sides requiring stickers.
Each die should have the following stickers placed on its indented
faces: one Light (green circle), one Medium (blue triangle), one
Heavy (red square), one Leader (helmet
symbol), one Banner (flag symbol), and
one Crossed Swords symbol. There is
one set of spare dice stickers.

Units, Leaders, and Blocks

A unit is composed of a certain number of blocks:

Foot Units:
•	 All light, light bow, light slinger, auxilia, warrior, medium and
heavy infantry units are composed of four small size blocks.

camel units are composed of three medium size blocks.

345 Blocks: gray Roman units, brown Carthaginian units and
black Victory Banners, comprising:

	 220	small gray and brown blocks for foot units (there will be
a few spare blocks of this size)
	 16	 small black blocks for Victory Banners
	 81	 medium gray and brown blocks for cavalry units
	 12	 large gray and brown blocks for elephant units
	 16	 rectangular gray and brown blocks for leaders and chariot
units

•	 All elephant units are composed of two large size blocks.

•	 All heavy chariot units are composed of two rectangular
blocks.
•	 Barbarian chariot units are composed of three rectangular
blocks.

•	 A Leader is not a unit. A Leader is represented by one
rectangular block.

Example of a foot unit (4 blocks) and a cavalry unit (3 blocks).

Command & Colors: Ancients

Apply appropriate unit stickers to the fronts and backs of the blocks
for each unit. Place Roman unit labels on the gray blocks and the
Carthaginian unit labels on the dark brown blocks. We suggest that
you separate the blocks by color, gray for Romans, brown for Carthaginians, then sort blocks by size. Start with the Roman Units. Pull
out 24 small gray blocks. Find the Roman Light Infantry stickers on
sheet 1 of 3 (there are two of these sheets). Peel and place stickers
front and back on the 24 small gray blocks. When you run out of the
24 blocks, move on to the Roman Light Bow Infantry. Pull out 8 small

gray blocks. Find the Roman Light Bow Infantry stickers on Sheet
1 of 3. Peel and place stickers on the front and back on the 8 small
gray blocks. When you run out of 8 blocks, move on to the Roman
Light Sling Infantry 4 blocks... Keep going in this fashion until all
the Roman units are completed and then move on to the Carthaginian
units and dark brown blocks. It will be worth the effort! A few extra
blocks and stickers are supplied as spares.
Note: Some units included in these rules are not used in this game’s
scenarios, but will appear in future expansion modules.

the battlefield, within easy reach of both players.
6. Place the seven battle dice within reach of both players.
8. Review any special rules or victory conditions that apply for
the battle.
9. The starting player, as indicated in the scenario’s War Council
notes, begins play.

4. OBJECT OF THE GAME
Unit Symbols and Colors

To help identify a unit’s type, colored symbols have been placed
on each label.
	

Green circle: light infantry, light sling infantry, light bow
infantry, light cavalry, light bow cavalry.

	

Green circle with white border: auxilia infantry, light
barbarian chariot

	

Blue symbol: medium infantry, medium cavalry,
camel.

	

Blue symbol with white border: warrior infantry,
cataphracted camel

	

Red symbol: heavy infantry, heavy cavalry, heavy chariot,
elephant, heavy war machine.

	

Red symbol with white border: heavy cataphracted
cavalry.

3. SETTING UP THE
GAME

The object of the game is to be the first to capture a set number
of Victory Banners (usually 5 to 8), depending on the selected
battle scenario’s victory conditions.
A Victory Banner is gained for each enemy leader or enemy unit
entirely eliminated. When the last block of a unit, or a leader, is
eliminated, collect one Victory Banner block. In some scenarios,
additional Victory Banners may be gained by capturing certain
terrain hexes or other battlefield objectives.
Victory is decided the instant the last banner required is
gained.

5. GAME-TURN
(Sequence of Play)

The War Council notes state which player goes first. Players
then alternate taking turns, until one of the players reaches the
number of Victory Banners indicated in the scenario’s victory
conditions.
During your turn, follow the sequence shown below:

1. Select a battle from the scenario section of the booklet. If this
is your first game of Commands & Colors: Ancients, we suggest
you use Akgragas to begin, as that battle has a small number of
units and no terrain rules involved.
2. Place the board in the center of the table. Each scenario
specifies which army is at the top or bottom of the battlefield,
and players should sit on the side closest to the army they will
command.

	
	
	
	
	

1. Play a Command card
2. Order units and leaders
3. Move
4. Battle (combat between units)
5. Draw a new Command card

Note that all movement must be completed before any battle
(between two units) is fought, and that each battle must be fought
to completion before another battle is begun.

3. Place the terrain hexes as indicated by the battle scenario
map.
4. Separate the blocks by Victory Banners, Carthaginian forces
(brown blocks) and Roman forces (gray blocks). Place the unit
blocks onto the board, matching the various units’ positions to
the scenario’s battle map. Note: Each unit symbol represents an
entire unit.
5. Shuffle the Command card deck thoroughly and deal Command cards to each side per the selected scenario’s War Council
notes. Keep your Command cards a secret from the opposing
player. Place the remainder of the deck face down, alongside

Command & Colors: Ancients

6. PLAY A COMMAND
CARD

At the start of your turn, play one Command card from your hand.
Place it face up in front of you and read it aloud.
Command cards are normally used to order units (and possibly
leaders) to move and/or battle. The card you play will indicate in
which section or sections of the battlefield you may issue orders,
and how many units (and possibly leaders) you may order.

7. ORDER UNITS AND
LEADERS

After playing a Command card, announce which eligible units
or leaders you choose to order.
Only those units or leaders chosen to receive an order from the
played card may move, battle, or take a special action.
A leader in the same hex as a friendly unit is considered to be
“attached” to the unit. If the unit is ordered to move, the attached
leader must move with the unit. An attached leader must move
to the same hex as the unit. Note that it still costs only one command to order a unit with an attached leader.
Units or leaders on a hex with a dotted line running through it
may be ordered from either section.
You may not give more than one order to each unit or leader. If
the Command card allows you to issue more orders in a given
section of the battlefield than you have units or leaders in that
section, those additional orders are lost.



When a Section Command card, the ‘Order Mounted Troops’
Command card or the ‘I am Spartacus’ Command card is played,
a leader in the same hex as a unit may be ordered to detach from
the unit and move by himself. It costs one order for each attached
leader that is detached from its unit and moved separately, and
the unit itself is not considered ordered (but could be ordered by
spending another command). The remaining orders on the Command card may be used to order units (including the one from
which a leader was detached), or unattached leaders. Section
Command cards, plus the ‘Order Mounted Troops’ and the ‘I
am Spartacus’ Command cards have a helmet symbol to remind
players that one or more attached leaders may be ordered to move
separately when playing these cards.
Command: Some cards allow you to order a number of units
equal to your side’s “Command.” A player’s Command is equal
to the maximum number of Command cards that player is
allowed to hold, as noted in the War Council section of the
scenario being played. When the number of Command cards
changes in a scenario, Command increases (or decreases) to the
new maximum number of cards allowed to be held at the moment the card is played.

8. MOVEMENT
Unit Movement

Unit movements are made sequentially, one ordered unit at a time,
in the sequence of your choice. You must complete one unit’s
movement before beginning another. In addition, you must
complete all unit movements before proceeding to Battle.
•	 A unit may only be ordered to move once per turn.
•	 A unit that is ordered does not have to move.

•	 Ordered units may move from one section of the battlefield
into another section.

The example above shows the movement rates of foot units.
Note the auxilia unit cannot battle if it moves two hexes. Also

note how the warrior unit may only move two hexes if it battles
after moving.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC



Command & Colors: Ancients

•	 An ordered unit may never move off the sides of a battlefield
unless scenario special rules offer that option. Aside from
special rules, units may not exit the battlefield, but leaders
may evade or escape off the battlefield on their own side, at
the owner’s choice.

•	 Two units may not occupy the same hex. When moving a
unit, you may not move onto or through a hex occupied by an
enemy unit, an enemy leader, or a friendly unit. Light Foot
Exceptions: see Command card ‘Order Light Troops’ and
‘Move-Fire-Move’ rules.

•	 A unit may move onto a hex with a friendly leader if the leader
is alone in the hex. However, it must stop in that hex even if it
has movement allowance remaining. The lone leader becomes
attached to the unit.
•	 You may not split off individual blocks from a unit; the blocks
in a unit must always stay together and move as a group.
•	 Units that are reduced through casualty losses (removing
blocks) may not combine with other units.

•	 Some terrain features affect movement and may prevent a unit
from moving its full allowance or battling during that turn (see
Terrain).
•	 Leaders are not units, and follow different movement rules
(see Leader Movement, page 7).

Retreat movement rules vary slightly from regular movement
(see Retreat).

The example above shows the movement rates of mounted units
and leaders. All the units in the example (except the leader by

Foot Unit Movement

The following unit types are all classified as foot units:
•	 Light infantry units (light infantry, light sling infantry, light
bow infantry) may move one or two hexes and battle.

•	 Auxilia infantry units may move one hex and battle or move
two hexes and not battle. Auxilia units are classed as Light
foot units for the purposes of being ordered to move and taking
hits.
•	 Medium infantry units may move one hex and battle.

•	 Warrior infantry units may move one hex and battle or move
two hexes and battle if the second hex takes them adjacent to
an enemy unit (warriors can only move two hexes in order to
battle in Close Combat, and this Close Combat is compulsory
after a two-hex “charge”). Warrior units are classed as Medium
foot units for the purposes of being ordered to move and taking
hits.
•	 Heavy infantry units may move one hex and battle.

•	 Heavy War machine units may move one hex but may not
battle when they move. Heavy war machine units are classed
as Heavy foot units for the purposes of being ordered to move
and taking hits.

Mounted Unit Movement

The following unit types are all classified as mounted units:

•	 Light cavalry and light bow cavalry units may move one, two,
three, or four hexes and battle.

himself) may battle after moving their full movement rate.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

Command & Colors: Ancients
•	 Barbarian chariot units may move one, two, or three hexes and
battle. Barbarian chariot units are classed as Light mounted units
for the purposes of being ordered to move and taking hits.
•	 Medium cavalry units may move one, two, or three hexes and
battle.

•	 Camel and cataphracted camel units may move one, two, or
three hexes and battle. All Camel units are classed as Medium
mounted units for the purposes of being ordered to move and
taking hits.

•	 Heavy cavalry and heavy cataphracted cavalry units may move
one or two hexes and battle.
•	 Elephant units may move one or two hexes and battle. Elephant
units are classed as Heavy mounted units for the purposes of
being ordered to move and taking hits.

•	 Heavy chariot units may move one or two hexes and battle.
Heavy chariot units are classed as Heavy mounted units for
the purposes of being ordered to move and taking hits.

Leader Movement

A leader may move one, two, or three hexes when moving alone.
A leader moving alone may move through hexes occupied by
friendly units and leaders, but cannot end movement in a hex
already occupied by another friendly leader. A leader may not
move onto or through a hex occupied by an  enemy unit or enemy
leader except to attempt escape (page 16).
A leader may only be ordered to move once per turn. A leader that
is ordered does not have to move (unless attached to an ordered
unit that is moved).
Ordered leaders may move from one section of the battlefield
into another section. A leader may never move off the short sides
of a battlefield or the long sides of the battlefield, top or bottom,
unless allowed by Battle Special Rules. Exception: Leader Evade
and Escape (page 16).

Only one leader may occupy a hex (however moving through a
hex is not considered occupying that hex). A leader in the same
hex with a friendly unit at the start of the player’s turn is said to
be “attached” to the unit. If the unit is ordered to move, the attached leader must move with it to the same hex. Note that only
one order is required to order a unit with an attached leader.

When a Section Command card, the Order Mounted Troops or
the I am Spartacus Command card is played, a leader in the same
hex as a unit may be ordered to detach from the unit and move
by himself. Section cards, the Order Mounted Troops Command
card and the I am Spartacus card have a helmet symbol to remind
players that one or more attached leaders may be ordered to
move separately when playing these cards. Each attached leader
detached from its unit and moved separately costs one order. The
remaining orders on the Command card may be used to order
units (including the one from which a leader was detached), or
unattached leaders. Note that a leader may not detach from a unit
when a ‘Leadership’ Command card is played.

An ordered leader may detach from one unit that has not yet
moved, and then move and attach to another unit. When a leader



moves onto a hex with another unit, the unit he attaches to is not
automatically ordered. The newly attached leader may not move
with the unit he has just joined, and even if the unit itself has been
ordered, it can now move no further (it can still battle however).
PLAY NOTE: Timing is important when detaching and attaching
leaders. Once an ordered unit with an attached leader moves,
the attached leader cannot be ordered to detach. Once a moving leader attaches to a new unit, the new unit may not move
if ordered, but the unit (and its attached leader) may Battle in
place. As an example, the owning player selects an Order Three
Units Center Command card and orders a heavy infantry unit,
its attached leader and a heavy cavalry unit in the center section.
The heavy cavalry unit is moved first and moves adjacent to an
enemy unit. The attached leader moves second, detaches from
the heavy infantry unit, and moves onto the hex with the heavy
cavalry unit where the leader ceases movement and attaches to
this unit. Had the heavy Infantry unit moved second, the attached
leader would have been required to move with it and could not
detach after moving. The heavy infantry unit moves third. The
ordered heavy cavalry unit and attached leader may now battle.
The ordered heavy infantry unit could battle if adjacent to an
enemy unit.

9. BATTLE

Battles are checked and resolved one ordered unit at a time, in
the sequence of your choice. You must announce and resolve one
unit’s battle entirely before beginning the next one.
•	 A unit that is ordered does not have to battle.

•	 A unit may normally battle only once per turn. Note: In some
situations, a unit may make a Momentum Advance after
a successful Close Combat and then make a bonus Close
Combat attack (see Special Actions—Momentum Advance).
This advance and bonus combat must be completed before
beginning another battle.
•	 A unit may not target and split its battle dice between several
enemy units.

The number of casualties a unit has suffered does not affect the
number of battle dice the unit rolls in combat. A unit with a single
block retains the same combat strength as a unit at full strength.
Exception: Warriors battle with more dice at full strength.
There are two types of battle:
•	 Ranged Combat
•	 Close Combat
An ordered unit may only engage in one type of battle when
ordered, even if it is capable of both types of battle.

Note again, combat sequence is purely at the owner’s choice and
he may freely switch between Ranged Combat and Close Combat
from one unit to the next during the battle phase.
Both types of battle are optional. Ordered units do not have to
engage in Close Combat, even when adjacent to enemy units.
Exception: Warriors units (page 9).

10. Ranged Combat (Fire)

Only units armed with missile weapons may engage in this type
of combat. Heavy war machine units are missile capable. Most
green circle symbol units (whether or not they have a white
border) have missile weapons. Only Light barbarian Chariots do
not. Other types of units may be designated as capable of ranged
fire in Scenario Special Rules.
A unit with missile weapons battling an enemy unit more than 1
hex away is said to conduct Ranged Combat (fire) at that enemy
unit (the “target unit”). In Ranged Combat, the target unit must
be within both range and line of sight of the firing unit.
•	 Ranged Combat may not be used against an adjacent enemy
unit.
•	 A unit adjacent to an enemy unit may not fire on another, more
distant, enemy unit. If it chooses to battle in this case, the unit
must Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit.
•	 A target unit may not Battle Back after a Ranged Combat attack
(see Battle Back).
•	 A target unit may not Evade a Ranged Combat attack.

Ranged Combat (Fire) Procedure

4. Determine terrain battle dice reduction
5. Resolve Battle
6. Score Hits
7. Apply Retreats
1. Announce Firing Unit: announce the ordered unit you want
to fire with and its target unit.
NOTE: Each Ranged Combat attack is declared and resolved
one ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. You
must announce and resolve one unit’s Ranged Combat entirely
before beginning the next unit’s battle. Regardless of the number
enemy units in range, each Ranged Combat is conducted by one
eligible, ordered unit against one enemy unit in line of sight and
in range. Multiple Ranged Combats against one enemy unit must
be made and resolved one at a time.
2. Check Range: verify that your target is within range. The
range is the distance between the firing unit and the target unit,
measured in hexes. When counting the range in hexes, include
the target unit’s hex but not the firing unit’s hex.
	 RANGED WEAPON UNIT	

RANGE

	 Light bow infantry and light slinger infantry	

3 hexes

	 Light infantry, light cavalry, auxilia	

1. Announce firing unit
2. Check Range
3. Check Line of Sight

	 Light bow cavalry	

	 Heavy war machine	

2 hexes
3 hexes
6 hexes

3. Check Line of Sight: verify that your target is within line of
sight. A unit must be able to “see” the enemy unit it wants to fire
at. This is known as having “line of sight.”

Imagine a line drawn from the center of the hex containing the
firing unit to the center of the hex containing the target unit. This
line of sight is blocked only if a hex (or part of a hex) between
the battling unit and the target hex contains an obstruction. Obstructions include a unit or leader (regardless if friend or foe),
some terrain features and the edge of the battlefield. The terrain
in the target unit’s hex does not block line of sight.
If the imaginary line runs along the edge of one or more hexes
that contain obstructions, line of sight is not blocked unless the
obstructions are on both sides of the line.
EXAMPLE OF RANGED COMBAT: All Roman units are ordered. The light bow unit fires at a range of three hexes, while
the light cavalry and light infantry units have a range of two.
The light slinger unit may not fire because its LOS is blocked
by friendly units. Assuming none of the units have moved, they
would each get two dice to use in Ranged Combat. If any of these
units had moved they would roll one die in Ranged Combat. The
auxilia unit may not fire, because it is adjacent to an enemy unit.
It could close combat the enemy cavalry unit before or after any
of the other unit’s ranged fire. Or, if the enemy cavalry unit is
destroyed or retreated by the other units’ ranged fire, and the
auxilia unit has not attacked in close combat, it could then possibly use ranged fire.

4. Determine terrain battle dice reduction (if any): Reduce
the number of battle dice rolled accordingly. Terrain battle dice
reductions are described in the section on Terrain.
5. Resolve Battle: roll battle dice and resolve resulting dice rolls.
The number of dice rolled depends upon whether or not the unit
held its position (did not move) before firing. If the unit did not
move prior to firing, it may use 2 dice in Ranged Combat; if
it moved, it may only use 1 die.

Exceptions:
•	 An auxilia unit that moves two hexes cannot use Ranged
Combat.
•	 A Heavy war machine unit that moves cannot use Ranged
Combat.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

Command & Colors: Ancients
•	 A light barbarian chariot unit cannot use Ranged Combat at
any time.
6. Score Hits on Units: the unit firing scores 1 hit for each dice
symbol rolled that matches the unit type targeted.

•	 A green circle will score one hit on units with a green circle
symbol (with or without a white border).
•	 A blue triangle will score one hit on units with a blue triangle
symbol (with or without a white border).
•	 A red square will score one hit on units with a red square
symbol (with or without white border).

A flag does not score a hit but may cause the unit to retreat (see
Retreat).
If the attacking unit rolls a leader symbol (leaders affect Close
Combat but not Ranged Combat), sword symbol, or a unit symbol that does not match the target unit, the Ranged Combat has
missed its target and has no effect.
Effect of Ranged Combat hits on Units: For each hit scored, 1
block is removed from the target unit. When the last block in the
opponent’s unit is removed, you collect a Victory Banner block.
If a player rolls more hits than the number of pieces in the enemy
unit, these additional hits have no effect.
Hits on Leaders: see Leader Casualty Checks.
7. Apply Retreats: See Retreat Section

11. Close Combat

A unit battling against an adjacent enemy unit is said to be in
Close Combat with the enemy unit. A unit adjacent to an enemy
unit must Close Combat the adjacent enemy unit if it chooses to
battle. It cannot use Ranged Combat (fire) against the adjacent
enemy unit or any other enemy unit within range.

Close Combat Procedure

1.	Announce Close Combat
2.	(possible) Evade (defender choice: see Evade rules)
3.	Determine terrain battle dice reduction (if any)
4.	Attacker rolls battle dice
5.	Attacker applies hits
6.	Apply Retreats
7.	Possible Momentum Advance and bonus Close Combat (see
Momentum Advance)
8.	Battle Back. The defender in some situations may Battle Back.
If Battle Back occurs, the defender applies any hits and resolves
retreats on the original attacking unit.
1. Announce Close Combat: Announce to your opponent which
ordered unit is going to attack in Close Combat and the enemy
unit it is attacking. A unit must be adjacent to an enemy unit to
engage in Close Combat.
NOTE: Each Close Combat attack is declared and resolved one



ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. You must
announce and resolve one unit’s Close Combat entirely (including
any Momentum Advance, Bonus Close Combat, and opponent’s
Battle Back) before beginning the next one. Regardless of the
number of friendly and enemy units adjacent to each other, each
Close Combat is conducted by one eligible, ordered unit against
one adjacent defending enemy unit. If more than one ordered
unit is adjacent to the defending enemy unit, each ordered Close
Combat attack is resolved separately.
2. Evade: Some defending units are eligible to Evade. This allows
them to move away from the attacking unit, modifying the Close
Combat resolution (see Special Actions—Evade).
3. Determine terrain battle dice reduction (if any): Reduce
the number of battle dice rolled accordingly. Terrain battle dice
reductions are described in the section on Terrain.
4. Attacker Rolls Battle Dice: Roll battle dice and resolve resulting dice rolls. The number of battle dice a unit rolls in Close
Combat is determined by its unit type.

Foot Unit Combat

•	 Light infantry, light sling infantry, and light bow infantry
units may either stay in position or move one or two hexes
and Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit with 2 battle dice.
These units do not score a hit if they roll a sword symbol in
Close Combat.

•	 An auxilia infantry unit may either stay in position or move
one hex and Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit with 3 battle
dice. If the unit moves two hexes, it may not Close Combat.
Although an auxilia is classed as a light unit, it does score a
hit if it rolls a sword symbol in Close Combat.
•	 A medium infantry unit may either stay in position or move
one hex and Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit with 4 battle
dice.
•	 A warrior infantry unit may either stay in position or move
one or two hexes and Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit
with 3 battle dice. Note that a warrior unit’s normal movement
is only one hex, but it may move two hexes when “charging”
into a Close Combat attack against an enemy unit. A warrior
unit that moves two hexes must then battle in Close Combat
(if any possible targets remain). A warrior unit at full strength
Close Combats with 1 additional battle die and may ignore one
flag rolled against it. A warrior unit loses these bonuses after
its first block is lost, but this only takes effect when the unit is
either attacked again by another enemy unit or is ordered to
battle during its own side’s turn. Note, the key point here is that
a full strength warrior who loses blocks in a close combat but
is entitled to Battle Back may roll 4 dice against the attacker
who inflicted the first casualties. In subsequent attacks, either

Combat an adjacent enemy unit with 2 battle dice. A heavy
war machine unit does not score a hit on a sword symbol in
Close Combat. A heavy war machine unit may not move and

Mounted Unit Combat

•	 Light cavalry and light bow cavalry units may either stay in
position or move one, two, three, or four hexes and Close
Combat an adjacent enemy unit with 2 battle dice. These units
do not score a hit on a sword symbol in Close Combat.

• Light barbarian chariot units may either stay in position or
move one, two or three hexes and Close Combat an adjacent
enemy unit with 2 battle dice. A barbarian chariot unit at full
strength Close Combats with 1 additional battle die and may
ignore one flag rolled against it. A barbarian chariot unit loses
these bonuses after its first block is lost, but this only takes
effect when the unit is either attacked again by another enemy
unit or is ordered to battle during its own side’s turn. As with

warriors, the key point here is that a full strength barbarian
chariot that loses blocks in a close combat, but is entitled to
Battle Back, may roll 3 dice against the attacker who inflicted
the first casualties. In subsequent attacks, either in this turn
or any that follow, the barbarian chariot unit will only close
combat with 2 dice.

•	 A medium cavalry unit may either stay in position or move
one, two, or three hexes and Close Combat an adjacent enemy
unit with 3 battle dice.

•	 A heavy cavalry unit (regular or cataphracted) may either stay
in position or move one or two hexes and Close Combat an
adjacent enemy unit with 4 battle dice. A heavy cataphracted
cavalry unit may ignore one sword hit rolled against it in Close
Combat.

Camel Unit Combat

A camel unit (regular or cataphracted) may either stay in position
or move one, two, or three hexes and Close Combat an adjacent
enemy unit with 3 battle dice. When Battling Back in Close
Combat (or from play of the First Strike card), a camel unit will
only roll 2 battle dice. A cataphracted camel unit may ignore one
sword hit rolled against it in Close Combat.
Camels vs. Cavalry and Chariots: Horses do not like the scent
of camels, hence the following rules. When a cavalry or chariot
unit is in Close Combat with a camel unit, the camel unit may
ignore one blue triangle hit. If a cavalry or chariot unit is forced
to retreat when in battle with a camel unit, it must retreat one
additional hex for each flag rolled by the camel unit.

Heavy Chariot Combat

WARRIOR EXAMPLE: A player orders two unsupported units
(a medium cavalry unit, and a heavy infantry unit). They are
adjacent to an unsupported full-strength enemy warrior unit.
The player chooses to conduct Close Combat against the warrior
unit, using the medium cavalry first. The cavalry unit rolls three
dice and scores one blue triangle hit and one flag. The warrior
unit loses one block, but chooses to ignore the flag so that it can
Battle Back. The warrior unit still rolls four dice (even though a
block was lost in this combat) because it started this combat at
full strength. The warriors roll one sword and one flag, scoring
a block loss on the medium cavalry, and forcing it to retreat 3
hexes. The first Close Combat is finished.
Because the Warrior unit is no longer at full strength, the warriors
will not be able to ignore the first flag and must battle with only
three dice in all subsequent combats. The heavy infantry unit now
engages in Close Combat against the warrior unit, rolling five
dice and scoring one sword hit, one blue triangle hit, and one
flag. The warrior unit loses two more blocks and must retreat 2
hexes because the flag cannot be ignored. The victorious heavy
infantry unit may choose to Momentum Advance onto the vacant
hex after the successful Close Combat.

A heavy chariot unit may either stay in position or move one or
two hexes and then Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit with
4 battle dice. When Battling Back in Close Combat (or from
play of the First Strike card), a heavy chariot unit will only roll 3
battle dice. A heavy chariot unit may ignore one sword hit rolled
against it in Close Combat.

Elephant Combat

•	 An elephant unit may either stay in position or move one or
two hexes and then Close Combat an adjacent enemy unit. In
Close Combat, an elephant unit will roll the same number of
battle dice as the unit it is attacking would normally roll against
the elephant.
•	 When an elephant unit Battles Back after being attacked in
Close Combat it will roll the same number of dice as the unit
which made the attack on the elephant unit normally rolls.
(The elephant does not use any “bonus” die that the attacking
unit receives.)
	
	
	
	
	
	

Special Situations:

additional rolls. All hits and retreats scored are applied only
after the extra rolls have been completed.

•	 Each sword symbol an elephant unit rolls in Close Combat
scores 1 hit. Furthermore, each battle die producing a sword
hit is rolled again for possible additional symbol hits, sword
hits, or flag results. Play Note: In other words, keep rolling
that die until a sword hit is no longer obtained! Take care to
track the total number of flags and hits scored as you make

However, if the elephant is attacking a unit that, due to terrain or
its own ability, can ignore sword hits, you do not re-roll them.

EXAMPLE OF CLOSE COMBAT: The Roman player has used an
‘Inspired Leadership’ command card to order the five Roman units
shown above. All moves are completed before any Close Combat is
conducted. Note that the movement routes shown above require moving the light cavalry first (otherwise it could not have moved through
hexes B and C). For this example, the defending units eligible to
Evade will not. Units will also ignore any flag results that can be
ignored. The Carthaginian player hopes to Battle Back.

the heavy infantry, the Roman player targets that unit, and rolls 5
dice. He will obtain hits with red squares and swords only (Leaders confer no benefits on Elephants in Close Combat, so the helmet
symbols do not count). The elephant will force a retreat with two
or more flags. The result is 1 red square hit, 2 sword hits, and 1
flag. The elephants re-roll the 2 dice that produced the sword hits,
but with no further hits or flags. The heavy infantry loses 3 of its
4 blocks to satisfy the red square and sword hits. The Carthaginian player chooses to ignore the retreat from the flag because the
heavy infantry is supported (there are two adjacent friendly units).
The heavy infantry holds and battles back with 5 dice (even though
only 1 block survived). The Carthaginian unit will hit only on red
squares (sword hits have no effect on elephants), and any flag will
cause elephant rampage and retreat.

A: The auxilia unit moved two hexes so it may not engage in Close
Combat. An alternate would have been to move the auxilia only one
hex and conduct Ranged Combat with one die.
B: The warrior unit moves two hexes and must battle either the
enemy heavy cavalry unit or the heavy infantry unit. The Roman
player chooses the heavy cavalry unit. His warrior unit is at full
strength, so he rolls 4 dice. He will score hits on red squares, swords,
and leader symbols (because a leader is attached). Two or more
flags rolled will force a retreat. Note that forcing a unit to retreat
is one of the primary advantages gained by attacking first in Close
Combat. If the defending unit is forced to retreat it may not battle
back. The warriors score 2 hits but no flags! The heavy cavalry loses
two blocks, but survives and may Battle Back with 4 battle dice. It
will score hits with blue triangles and swords, but will need four
flags to force a retreat.
C: The elephant can battle the heavy infantry with 5 battle dice, or
the light bow infantry with 2 dice. Sensing a chance to destroy

Thus, if an elephant is attacking a Foot unit in a fortified camp
(which can ignore one flag and one sword), the “first” sword the
elephant rolls is not a hit and is not re-rolled. If the elephant rolls

D: The light cavalry will battle the light bow infantry and will score
hits only with green circles (swords do not cause hits), and will cause
retreats with two flags. The defending light bow unit can choose to
ignore one flag because it is supported, and if it does not retreat, it
will Battle Back with two dice, scoring hits only with green circles,
or retreats with two or more flags.
E: The heavy chariot unit battles the Carthaginian heavy chariot
unit with 4 dice. It will hit on red squares and swords, and will cause
a retreat with any flags (the chariots are not supported and have
no leader to bolster morale). The defending chariot can ignore one
sword hit, and if able to battle back, will roll 3 dice.

2 or more sword hits, those beyond the first do count as hits and
are re-rolled. Since Elephants ignore all sword hits, if an Elephant
was attacking another Elephant, any sword hits rolled would be
ignored. (No re-roll.)
EXAMPLE: An elephant unit attacks an unsupported full-strength
light infantry unit that chooses not to Evade. The elephants roll
two dice because they are in Close Combat with a light infantry
unit. The elephant unit scores one green circle hit and one sword
hit. The die producing the sword hit is re-rolled and produces
another sword hit. This die is rolled for a third time, producing a
flag result. The die may no longer be re-rolled, and the damage
to the light infantry unit is tallied: one green circle hit, two sword
hits, and one retreat flag. The thoroughly beaten light infantry
unit loses three of its four blocks and must retreat its maximum
movement allowance of two hexes. The elephant unit may now
Momentum Advance onto the vacated hex.
•	 An Elephant unit ignores all sword hits rolled against it in
Close Combat.

•	 An Elephant unit will not receive close combat or morale
benefits from an attached leader or close combat benefit from
a leader in an adjacent hex.
Elephants vs. Cavalry and Chariots: Horses were easily fright-

ened by elephants in battle, hence the following rules: When a
cavalry or chariot unit is in Close Combat with an elephant unit,
the elephant unit may ignore one red square hit and one flag. If
a cavalry or chariot unit is forced to retreat when in battle with
an elephant unit, it must retreat one additional hex for each flag
rolled by the elephant unit.

Leaders in Close Combat

Leaders engage in combat somewhat differently from units. A
leader may not battle if he is alone in a hex. However, a leader
will inspire attached or adjacent friendly units which are attacking
or Battling Back in Close Combat. If a friendly leader is attached
to or adjacent to the battling unit, the unit scores a hit for each
leader helmet symbol rolled on its battle dice, regardless of the
type of unit being attacked.
Exception: A leader does not modify an elephant unit’s Close
Combat dice.

Score Hits

In Close Combat, the unit attacking scores 1 hit for each die
symbol rolled that matches the target unit. It does not matter
whether or not the symbol has a white border.
•	 A green circle will score one hit on units with any kind of green
circle symbol.

ELEPHANTS IN CLOSE COMBAT:

A: In battle A the elephants have attacked the heavy cavalry and
inflicted one flag result. Heavy cavalry units normally retreat
2 hexes but if attacked by elephants they retreat 3 hexes. The
image above shows some of the retreat path options. Because it
cannot retreat one of its hexes it will lose one block. The Roman
elephant unit chooses to Momentum Advance onto the vacated
hex, and chooses not to take a bonus Close Combat.
B: In battle B the Roman warrior unit inflicted two flag results
on the Carthaginian elephant and so it must Rampage and then
retreat two hexes. Note that the two friendly units behind the elephant do not provide support (bolster morale) because elephant
units cannot receive support—only provide it. First it Rampages

against all adjacent hexes—five units in this case. The Roman
player rolls two dice each for possible loss of the units in hexes
X and Y, while his opponent rolls for the three Roman units still
adjacent the rampaging elephant. (Note that the Roman elephant
shown in the example has already Momentum Advanced into
the hex it attacked, and thus avoids the elephant rampage.) If
the Roman warrior unit is hit the leader attached must make a
leader loss check. After rolling for all five hexes the elephant unit
is retreated. Since its retreat path is blocked, it remains in place
and the two friendly blocking units will suffer two hits each (one
for each hex the elephant could not retreat). The Carthaginian
elephant may now battle back against the warrior unit.

•	 One hit is scored in Close Combat for each sword symbol
rolled (with some exceptions).

•	 One hit is scored in Close Combat for each leader helmet
symbol rolled, if a friendly leader is attached to or adjacent
to the unit that is battling, regardless of the type of unit being

on the battlefield after taking losses (see Retreat).
During a Battle Back, the unit determines any terrain battle dice
reduction, and resolves Battle Back (roll battle dice and apply
hits and retreats) in the same manner as the attacker.
Special Situations:	

•	 Elephant Battle Back against elephant—roll 3 dice.

•	 Elephant Battle Back against a warrior unit—roll 3 dice.

•	 Elephant Battle Back against a heavy chariot unit—roll 3

•	 Heavy Chariots roll 3 dice in Battle Back.

•	 Camels and cataphracted camels roll 2 dice in Battle Back.

12. RETREAT

Retreats are resolved only after any hits have been resolved by removing blocks from the affected unit. For each flag rolled against
the target unit, the unit must move one movement back toward its
own side of the battlefield. A movement is the maximum number
of hexes a unit may move when given an order.
Exceptions: Warriors retreat 2 hexes. Elephants and auxilia
retreat 1 hex.

•	 Camel units ignore one blue triangle hit from cavalry or chariot
units in Close Combat.

EXAMPLE: a light horse unit incurring one flag against it would
retreat its maximum move of 4 hexes. If two flags were rolled
against it, the light horse unit would have to retreat 8 hexes!
A light infantry unit would retreat 2 hexes for each flag rolled
against it. If three flags were rolled against the light infantry
unit, it would have to retreat six hexes.

•	 Cataphracted heavy cavalry units ignore one sword hit in Close
Combat.

The player controlling the unit decides which hex the unit retreats
onto, using the following rules:

Effect of Close Combat Hits on Units

•	 A unit must always retreat toward its controlling player’s side
of the board, regardless of what direction the attack came from.
Units may never retreat sideways.

•	 Cataphracted camel units ignore one sword hit and one blue
triangle hit from cavalry or chariot units in Close Combat.

For each hit scored, 1 block is removed from the target unit.
When the last block in the opponent’s unit is removed, the unit
has been eliminated and you collect a Victory Banner block. If
a player rolls more hits than the number of blocks remaining in
the enemy unit, the additional hits have no effect.
Hits on Leaders—see Leader Casualty Checks
6. Apply Retreats: See Retreat Section
7. Possible Momentum Advance and Bonus Close Combat:
see Momentum Advance
8. Battle Back: In Close Combat, the defending enemy unit
may Battle Back against the attacking unit if one or more of the
defending unit’s blocks survived the Close Combat attack and
the defending unit did not retreat from its hex.
If the defending unit is forced to retreat out of its original hex,
it may not Battle Back, even if the retreat move leaves the unit
in a hex that is still adjacent to the attacking unit.
If the defending unit was unable to fulfill a required retreat, it may
Battle Back as long as it still has one or more blocks remaining

•	 Terrain that is not impassable has no effect on retreat moves,
therefore a retreating unit may move onto and through a forest
or a fordable river, etc., without stopping. However, impassable
terrain blocks retreat.
•	 A unit may not retreat onto or through a hex already containing
another unit (regardless if friend or foe).
•	 An attached leader must retreat with its unit if the unit is forced
to retreat.

•	 A unit without an attached leader may retreat onto a hex that
contains an unattached friendly leader (i.e. a leader alone in a
hex). The leader is immediately attached to that unit and the
unit’s retreat stops in the leader’s hex. The unit ignores any
additional retreat movement.
•	 If a unit cannot retreat because its retreat path is occupied by
units (regardless if friend or foe), an enemy leader that is alone
in a hex, or it is forced to retreat off the battlefield or onto a
hex that has impassable terrain, one block must be removed

from the unit for each hex of the mandated retreat movement
that the unit cannot fulfill. If a unit can retreat legally (first
bullet) without taking block losses, it must take this retreat
path Instead of one where block losses occur.

EXAMPLE: if a light infantry unit must accept a retreat result
when it is on its own baseline, its retreat should be 2 hexes.
However, because it is at the edge of the battlefield, it cannot
make any retreat movement and therefore must lose two blocks
—one block for each retreat hex it cannot fulfill.

Bolster Morale

Some situations allow a unit to disregard one or more flags rolled
against it. If more than one of the following situations applies,
the effects are cumulative. A unit in such a situation may choose
to disregard flags each time it is attacked.
•	 A unit may disregard one flag when a leader is attached to the
unit (leader is in the hex with the unit). If the unit loses one or
more blocks, the leader must survive the leader casualty check
for the unit to ignore one flag.

EXAMPLE OF EVADE AND BATTLE
A: The medium infantry unit attempts to battle the light bow
infantry unit (both units are reduced), but the defending unit
Evades instead. The Roman player rolls 4 dice but only green
circle symbols will hit. If the evading unit survives, it must be
moved 2 hexes towards its battlefield edge. In this case it can only
Evade one hex (which is allowed if there is no alternative).
D&E: The heavy infantry unit with an attached leader conducts
Close Combat against hex D. Even though the heavy infantry
unit has only one block left it still battles with 5 dice. The result
is 1 hit and 1 helmet-enough to eliminate the unit. The heavy
infantry unit and leader advance, and then make a bonus Close
Combat against hex E. The cavalry unit evades. Before the Evade

•	 A unit may disregard one flag when supported by two friendly
units. Support units may be in any two hexes that are adjacent
to the unit.
•	 A leader, when alone in a hex, may act as an adjacent support
unit and can provide support just as a unit does.
•	 Some terrain allows a defending unit on the terrain to disregard
one flag (see Terrain).
•	 Full-strength warrior units may disregard one flag result.

•	 Elephants may act as a support unit, but may not receive
support from units or leaders.

Note that disregarding a flag result is purely a matter of choice.
The owning player may decide he wishes to accept a flag result
(which could take his unit out of danger). If more than one flag
result can be ignored, the owning player can choose to ignore
one (or more) and accept one (or more), but, if he accepts a
flag result, he must retreat the full amount that each flag would
normally cause. EXAMPLE, a medium cavalry unit with an attached leader and bolstered morale receives 2 flag results from

movement is carried out, the Roman player gets to roll 5 dice,
but will only hit on blue triangle symbols.
B&C: The heavy cavalry unit (4 battle dice) Close Combats
the chariot unit and forces it to retreat (chariots may not Evade
against cavalry). The heavy cavalry unit can now make a Momentum Advance through the vacated hex and onto hex X. From
there it conducts a bonus Close Combat against the slingers in
hex C who have no chance to Evade. The result of 4 dice is 1 hit
and 1 flag, and since the slingers’ retreat path is blocked, this is
enough to eliminate the unit. The heavy cavalry unit could make
another Momentum Advance onto the hex, but would not get the
one additional hex or another bonus Close Combat this turn.

a ranged fire attack. The owning player sees that he faces close
combat that may be dangerous, so he chooses to ignore one flag
and accept the other. He must retreat the unit 3 hexes or suffer
normal consequences for being unable to do so.

Elephant Retreat (Rampage)

An elephant, when it retreats, goes on a Rampage before it is
moved back. All units and any leaders who are alone in adjacent
hexes (friend and foe) must check to see if they are trampled.
(This can include the attacker who prompted the Rampage!)
Roll two dice for each adjacent hex with a unit or a lone leader.
During a rampage, your opponent rolls for hits on your units,
and you roll for hits on his units. A hit is scored when the symbol
rolled matches the unit type. A leader helmet will eliminate a
lone leader. If the leader is not hit on the rampage roll he must
evade. All other symbols are ignored.
After the Rampage, the elephant completes its retreat movement. If the retreat path of an elephant unit towards its side of
the battlefield is occupied by friendly units, enemy units, or a
lone enemy leader, the elephant is not moved back and does not
lose any blocks; rather, the units or enemy leader that occupy the

EXAMPLE OF RETREATS: The medium cavalry unit in hex A
has been attacked and has two flags rolled against it. The medium
cavalry unit may ignore one flag because it is supported, but
must still retreat 3 hexes. Fortunately, the first hex (X) contains
a leader by himself, which attaches to the retreating unit and
stops its retreat. The light cavalry in hex B is attacked and has
two flags rolled against it. The light cavalry unit may ignore
one flag because it is supported, but must still retreat 4 hexes.
Because its retreat path is occupied by friendly units, it must
lose all three blocks—one for each hex it could not retreat, since
hexes X and Z are occupied by friendly units. The three-block
loss eliminates the unit. Note that it could not retreat to hex Y
because a retreat must always proceed in the direction of the
unit’s battlefield edge.

15

hexes of the retreat path must each lose one block for each hex
of its retreat that the elephant was unable to fulfill. A lone enemy
leader is removed without a leader casualty check and counts
as a Victory Banner. (A lone friendly leader does not block the
elephant’s retreat. The elephant unit would move onto the hex
with the lone friendly leader and cease further retreat. This is the
only case where a leader can influence an elephant.)

ELEPHANT RETREAT EXAMPLE: An elephant unit is attacked
and two flags are rolled against it. After the Rampage roll, the
elephant unit must retreat 2 hexes, but two units occupy the
elephant’s retreat path, a unit with one block and a full-strength
unit. The elephant therefore will not retreat from its hex. Instead
each unit in its retreat path must lose two blocks—one for each
retreat hex the elephant cannot complete. The unit with one block
is eliminated and the other unit must lose two blocks, gaining a
victory banner for the opponent.
PLAY NOTE: Since scenarios end the instant the final Victory
Banner is gained, a situation when an Elephant rampages or
retreats could set up a victory dilemma, because it is possible
that units from both sides are eliminated during a Rampage
or an elephant retreat. The order of elephant rampage rolls is
determined by the player that caused the Rampage. Resolve the
Rampage die rolls, and award any Victory Banners one at a time
for units eliminated by the Rampage. Using this procedure, a
Rampage cannot cause a draw. When an elephant’s retreat path
is blocked by units from both sides, remove all retreat losses at
the same time and award any Banners which may occur as a
result of the losses. If both sides gain a final Victory Banner as
a result of these loses, the battle ends in a draw.

13. SPECIAL ACTIONS
Evade

When being attacked in Close Combat, the defender may announce the unit is going to Evade instead of staying and fighting
in Close Combat. Note: An attacking unit may not Evade if the
defender Battles Back. If the die roll against the evading unit
eliminates the evading unit one Victory Banner is gained.

The attacking unit determines and rolls the proper number of Close
Combat battle dice against the evading unit before it Evades, but
only symbols that match the evading unit will score a hit. All other
unit symbols, leader, swords, and flags rolled are ignored.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

16

Command & Colors: Ancients

If the evading unit receives a hit and has an attached leader, a
leader casualty check is made to see if the leader is hit, using
normal rules.
Evade Eligibility: The following units may Evade:

•	 Light units (light infantry, light sling infantry, light bow
infantry, light cavalry, light bow cavalry, barbarian chariot)
may always Evade.

•	 War machine units may (almost) always evade. See War
Machine Evade.

•	 A leader must Evade if he is alone in a hex (see Leader
Evade).
•	 Medium cavalry, camel and cataphracted camel units may
Evade all foot and heavy mounted units.

•	 Heavy cavalry, Heavy cataphracted cavalry and heavy chariot
units may Evade all foot and elephant units.
•	 Auxilia, medium infantry, warrior, heavy infantry, and elephant
units may never Evade.

Evade Procedure: An Evade movement is a 2 hex move towards
the unit’s own side of the battlefield. An Evade move of 1 hex is
possible and is permitted, but only if it is the only possible hex
available. A unit may not Evade if both hexes towards its side
of the battlefield are occupied by impassable terrain hexes, units
(regardless if friend or foe) or a lone enemy leader.
If the first hex a unit evades to includes a lone friendly leader,
the unit stops in that hex and the leader is attached to the unit.
(This counts as a legal Evade.)
An evading unit may not Battle Back, even when it ends in a hex
that is adjacent to the unit making the attack.
The attacking unit may not occupy the defender’s original hex,
regardless of the result of the attacking unit’s die roll on the evading unit. Even if the evading unit is eliminated by the attacking
unit’s die roll, the attacking unit may not enter the hex.
NOTE: Evasion is not simply “running away.” Evading usually
represents a fighting withdrawal that hinders the enemy advance,
but at some risk to the unit.

War Machine Evade

The attacking unit rolls normally against the evading war machine
unit. If the war machine unit is eliminated, the attacker gains a

Victory banner. If not eliminated, the war machine unit executes
a valid one or two hex evade move, and then the war machine
unit is removed from the battlefield. The war machine crew has
escaped and does not count as a Victory Banner.

Leader Evade

Leaders Evade somewhat differently from units. A leader’s
Evade movement is 1, 2, or 3 hexes back towards his own side
of the battlefield.
When a leader is attached to a unit and the unit loses its last block
by Ranged Combat or Close Combat, make a leader casualty
check on the leader by rolling one die. To score a hit on the
leader, you need to roll one leader symbol. If the leader is not
eliminated, the leader must evade. If this occurs in Close Combat,
the attacking unit may take a Momentum Advance because it
eliminated the defending unit.
When a leader is alone in a hex (unattached), and is attacked by
Ranged Combat or Close Combat, the unit attacking the leader
determines the normal number of battle dice to roll. To score a
hit and eliminate the leader, you need to roll one leader symbol.
If the leader is not eliminated, he must evade. The attacking unit
may not make a Momentum Advance after Close Combat against
an unattached leader, whether the leader is eliminated or not.
When a leader Evades he must follow these rules:
•	 A leader’s Evade movement is 1, 2, or 3 hexes back towards his
own side of the battlefield. The player who controls the leader
determines the number of hexes he will move, and which path
he will take as he Evades.
•	 An Evading leader may move through friendly units, friendly
units with an attached leader and friendly leader alone in a
hex.

•	 A leader may not end his Evade movement in a hex that
contains another friendly leader, impassable terrain, an enemy
unit or enemy leader. However, a leader may Evade through a
hex that contains a friendly unit or another friendly leader.
•	 An Evading leader may move through an enemy unit, but this
is governed by the rules for Leader Escape.
•	 After completing his move, if the leader is on a hex with a
friendly unit, he is considered attached to that unit.
•	 Units are not affected by a leader Evading through their hex.

•	 You may choose to Evade your leader off your side of the
battlefield. This saves the leader from becoming a Victory
Banner for your opponent but you lose a strong command
piece by doing so.
•	 If the leader cannot Evade a minimum of one hex (due to
Impassable terrain) the leader is eliminated and the opponent
gains one Victory Banner.

Leader Escape

If enemy units occupy one or two hexes of a leader’s designated
Evade path, the evading leader must attempt to escape through
those hexes.
© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

Command & Colors: Ancients

Leader Escape Procedure:

•	 Move the leader onto one of the enemy hexes. Allow the enemy
unit in the hex to battle the leader. The attacking unit uses its
normal number of Close Combat dice. The leader does not
benefit from terrain.
•	 To score a hit on a leader trying to escape, you need to roll one
leader symbol.

•	 If the leader is not hit, his escape is successful and he continues
with his Evade move by moving onto the next hex. If this
hex is also occupied by an enemy unit, the leader must again
undergo the Escape procedure listed above. If his third hex of
movement is also onto a hex with enemy units, he is eliminated
and the opponent gains a victory banner.
•	 If the leader ends his Escape move on a hex with a friendly
unit, he is attached to the unit.

Examples of Leader Evade and Escape:

1) An enemy light infantry unit and medium
cavalry unit occupy the two hexes behind a
lone leader who must evade. The hexes behind
these two enemy units are vacant. The leader
chooses to evade through the hex with the
light infantry because the opposing player will
roll only two dice instead of the three dice the
medium cavalry unit would roll. The opposing
player rolls two dice and gets one sword hit
and one red square. Since no helmet symbols were rolled, the
leader successfully escapes and finishes the Evade move after
moving one or two more hexes.
2) The hex behind a lone leader is vacant. The
next hex is occupied by a medium cavalry unit.
A friendly unit without a leader occupies the
hex behind the medium cavalry unit. The leader
could make a one hex Evade onto the vacant
hex, but elects to Evade three hexes, ending on
the hex with the friendly unit. Upon entering
the second hex containing the medium cavalry
unit, the Evade move is halted, and the opposing player rolls three dice, obtaining two flags
and a green circle. Since no helmet symbols
were rolled, the leader successfully escapes and
continues the Evade move onto the third and final hex containing
the friendly unit.
3) The only available Evade path has an enemy
light infantry unit on the first hex and an enemy
medium cavalry unit on the second hex. The
evading leader moves onto the first hex and halts
while the opposing player rolls two dice for the
light infantry unit, obtaining a flag and a sword.
The escape succeeds, but the leader now must
undergo another escape attempt as the leader is
moved onto the second hex. The opposing player
rolls three dice for the medium cavalry unit,
and obtains a blue triangle hit and two helmets.

17

Only one helmet is needed, and the leader is removed, one hex
short of safety. The opposing player earns one banner for the
eliminated leader.

Momentum Advance

When an ordered unit attacks in Close Combat and eliminates
or forces the defending enemy unit to retreat from the hex it
occupies, it has conducted a successful Close Combat. The
victorious attacking unit may advance (move) onto that vacated
hex. This is referred to as a Momentum Advance, where the
unit’s momentum after the successful Close Combat carries it
onto the vacated hex.
A Momentum Advance after a successful Close Combat is not
mandatory. However, if the Momentum Advance is not taken, the
victorious attacking unit forfeits the possible opportunity to make
a bonus Close Combat, even if adjacent to other enemy units.
Cavalry Special Momentum Advance: A cavalry unit (light,
light bow, medium, heavy or heavy cataphracted cavalry), after its
initial successful Close Combat, may Momentum Advance into
the vacated hex and then move one additional hex. All camels,
chariots and elephants, while considered mounted units, are not
cavalry and are not eligible for the additional one hex movement.
This one hex additional move is optional and is not required to
conduct a bonus Close Combat. After a successful bonus Close
Combat a cavalry unit may only momentum advance onto the
vacated hex.
The following situations do not allow Momentum Advance:

•	 If a defending unit Evades a Close Combat attack, the attacking
unit may not claim a Momentum Advance onto the vacated
hex.
•	 When a leader is alone in a hex and is attacked in a Close
Combat, the leader must Evade. The attacking unit may not
claim a Momentum Advance onto the vacated hex.
•	 A unit Battling Back is not eligible to take a Momentum
Advance.

•	 A unit ordered by a ‘First Strike’ card is not eligible to
Momentum Advance, but the unit targeted by the First Strike
remains eligible for Momentum Advance and possible bonus
Close Combat.
•	 Some terrain restrictions will prevent a Momentum Advance.

•	 A War Machine unit may never make a Momentum Advance.

Bonus Close Combat

After a successful Close Combat, some units that make a Momentum Advance are eligible to battle in Close Combat a second time. This bonus Close Combat is optional and making the
Momentum Advance does not require an eligible unit to attack
in Close Combat again.
The following units may choose to conduct a bonus Close Combat
after a successful Close Combat and Momentum Advance:
•	 A warrior unit may make a bonus Close Combat after a
Momentum Advance.
© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

18

Command & Colors: Ancients

•	 A non-warrior foot unit with an attached leader (except for War
Machines) may make a bonus Close Combat after a Momentum
Advance.

If a unit with an attached leader only takes flag results, there is
no leader casualty check required unless the unit loses blocks
when the unit is unable to retreat.

Note, a cavalry unit on its initial successful Close Combat
may Momentum Advance into the vacated hex and then move
one additional hex—in any direction (including back to their
original hex).

Leader’s Unit Eliminated: When a leader is attached to a unit
and the unit is eliminated, leaving the leader alone in the hex,
the leader casualty check is made with only 1 die. To hit the
leader, you need to roll one leader symbol. If the leader is not
hit on this single die roll, the leader must Evade 1, 2, or 3 hexes
back toward his own side of the battlefield (see Special Actions
Leader Evade).

A unit that qualifies for a bonus Close Combat attack after a
Momentum Advance may choose to battle any enemy unit in
any adjacent hex. It does not have to battle the enemy unit that
just retreated from the hex.

When the attached leader’s unit is eliminated in Close Combat,
the attacking unit may Momentum Advance into the vacated hex
after the leader Evades out of the hex.

•	 A camel, cataphracted camel, cavalry, cataphracted cavalry,
chariot, barbarian chariot or elephant unit may make a bonus
Close Combat after a Momentum Advance.

•	 Some terrain restrictions prevent a bonus Close Combat.

When a unit’s bonus Close Combat is successful it may Momentum Advance into the vacated hex but may not battle again
this turn. A cavalry unit on a successful bonus Close Combat
may only move onto the vacated hex, it may not move the one
additional hex. Some terrain restrictions prevent movement into
the vacated hex

14. Leaders

Leader Casualty Checks

There are a number of situations when a leader casualty check
must be taken.
Attached Leaders: When a leader is attached to a unit and the
unit loses one or more blocks without being eliminated, there
is a chance the leader may also be hit. Make a leader casualty
check by rolling 2 battle dice. To hit the leader, you need to roll
two leader symbols. A leader casualty check must be made when
a unit loses a block from:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Ranged Combat
Close Combat
Evading
Failure to complete a retreat move
Elephant Rampage
Occupying an elephant unit’s retreat.
Rolling Fire (Expansion #2)
Entering a Marsh hex

Flags rolled against a unit that was eliminated have no effect
on the leader.

Leader Alone in a Hex: When an unattached leader is alone in
a hex and is attacked by Ranged Combat or Close Combat, the
attacking unit rolls its normal number of battle dice. To score
a hit on the leader, you need to roll one leader symbol. If the
leader is not hit, he must Evade 1, 2 or, 3 hexes back towards his
own side of the battlefield (see Special Actions Leader Evade).
A lone leader who Evades or moves into a Marsh hex must roll
one die. If a leader symbol is rolled, the leader is removed and
the opposing player gains a Victory Banner block. On any other
result, an Evading leader may stop or continue the Evade, and a
moving leader must stop.
Flags rolled against a leader when alone in a hex, have no effect.

A unit attacking a lone leader in Close Combat may not Momentum Advance into the vacated hex after the leader is eliminated
or Evades out of the hex.

Leader Hits

If an opponent’s leader is hit, remove the leader block from the
battlefield and collect a Victory Banner block.

Summary of Leader Benefits

Leaders have beneficial effects when attached or adjacent to
friendly units. A leader:
1.	converts leader symbol results into hits in Close Combat, when
attached or adjacent to a friendly non-elephant unit in Close
Combat. Note that a leader does not affect Ranged Combat.

NOTE: Only one leader casualty check is made during any
combat sequence.
EXAMPLE: when a unit with an attached leader loses blocks
in Close Combat, a leader casualty check is made after the
blocks are removed. If the unit also retreats because of flags on
the same combat dice roll and the unit loses more blocks due to
all retreat paths being occupied, another leader casualty check
is not required. The flag losses are from the same combat dice
roll and only one leadership casualty check is made on a leader
during a combat sequence.

2.	bolsters morale—any unit to which a leader is attached to
may ignore 1 flag. And, an adjacent lone leader (plus one
other adjacent friendly unit) bolsters morale the same as two
adjacent friendly units.
3.	allows any foot unit to which it is attached to make a bonus
Close Combat attack after a Momentum Advance (see
Momentum Advance).
Leaders also provide an enormous benefit when it comes to moving units with Command cards (see Command card section).

a lake, with the same effects in the game.

River

Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a forest hex.
Light infantry, light sling infantry, light bow infantry, auxilia
infantry and warrior infantry units are the exception. These
units may move onto a forest hex and still battle. These are also
the only units which can Momentum Advance into a forest hex
and have the potential for a bonus Close Combat. Other units
which Momentum Advance into a forest hex may not bonus
Close Combat.
A unit battling an enemy unit on a forest hex or a unit on a forest
hex battling out, will roll a maximum of 2 dice in close combat.
A unit that targets an enemy unit on a forest hex with Ranged
Combat will roll a maximum of 1 die. A Command card that
adds additional dice in battle will modify the number of battle

Normally river hexes are treated as impassable
terrain.

Fordable River (specified in scenario

instructions)
Movement: All units and leaders must stop when
entering a fordable river hex and may move no
further on that turn.
Battle: A unit may battle on the turn it enters a
fordable river hex. When battling an enemy unit
on a fordable river hex or a unit on a fordable river hex battling
out, both units will roll a maximum of 2 battle dice. A unit that
battles with Ranged Combat out of a river will roll a maximum
of 1 battle die. A Command card that adds additional dice in
battle will modify the maximum number of battle dice that can

be rolled. After a successful Close Combat, a unit on a fordable
river hex may make a Momentum Advance out of that hex.
Line of Sight: A fordable river hex does not block line of
sight.

Ramparts

Forward facing hex sides

Movement: No movement restrictions.

The following terrain types are not used in the scenarios
included with this game but come in expansions.

Bridge

These rules are used for all bridges, including
pontoon.
Movement: No movement restrictions.
Battle:

Battle: A Rampart provides
protection along the two or three
forward facing hex sides.
Close Combat: When attacked by an enemy unit across a hex
side with a rampart, the defending unit disregards one sword
symbol and may disregard one flag rolled against the unit. Note
that the defending unit does not receive rampart protection when
the enemy unit is not attacking across a hex side with the rampart
(normally this is from a hex directly to the side or directly behind
the two rampart protected hex sides).
Ranged Combat: A unit attacked through a forward facing
rampart hexside may disregard one flag rolled against it.
A Command card that adds additional dice in battle will modify
the number of battle dice maximum that may be rolled.
NOTE: mounted units receive no protective benefit from ramparts.
Line of Sight: A rampart hexside does not block line of sight.

Fortified Camp

Movement: No movement restrictions.
Battle:

•	 Close Combat: A unit defending on a fortified
camp hex disregards one sword symbol and
may disregard one flag rolled against it.

•	 Ranged Combat: A unit defending on a fortified camp hex
may disregard one flag rolled against it.

NOTE: mounted units receive no protective benefit from fortified
camp hexes.
•	 A fortified camp hex offers this protection against attacks from
all sides.
•	 A unit on a fortified camp hex rolls one fewer battle dice than
usual when it battles (this applies to Close Combat and Ranged
Fire).

A Command card that adds additional dice in battle will modify
the number of battle dice maximum that may be rolled.
Line of Sight: A fortified camp hex blocks line of sight.

•	 A unit may battle on the turn it enters a bridge hex. A unit on a
bridge hex battling out will roll a maximum of two battle dice
in Close Combat or one battle die in Ranged Combat. A unit
on a bridge hex may still make a Momentum Advance after
a successful close combat. A foot unit defending on a bridge
hex may ignore one flag rolled against it.
•	 When battling an enemy unit on a bridge hex, a maximum of
two battle dice are rolled in Close Combat. Ranged Combat
is unaffected.
•	 A Command card that adds additional dice in battle will modify
the number of battle dice maximum that may be rolled.
Line of Sight: A bridge hex does not block line of sight.

Scalable City Walls

(use rampart terrain hexes for scalable city walls)
Movement:

•	 Foot units (except war machine) and Leaders: To move
onto a scalable city wall hex, a foot unit or leader must start
its move from a hex adjacent to the scalable city wall hex. A
foot unit or leader that enters a scalable city wall hex must stop
and may move no further on that turn. A foot unit or leader
that moves off a scalable city wall hex may only move onto an
adjacent hex and may move no further on that turn. Retreating
or Evading Foot units or leaders do not have to stop when
entering a scalable city wall hex.
•	 Mounted units and war machines: A scalable city wall hex
is impassable terrain for a mounted unit or war machine. Both
may Close Combat adjacent units on scalable city wall hexes
if they begin their turn adjacent to the scalable city wall hex.
Neither type of unit may retreat or evade onto a scalable city
wall hex.

Battle:
Close Combat: When battling an enemy unit on a scalable city
wall hex or a unit on a scalable city wall hex battling out, the
unit rolls a maximum of 2 battle dice in Close Combat. Any
unit defending on a scalable city wall hex disregards one sword
symbol and may disregard one flag rolled against it when attacked
from any adjacent hex.
•	 A defending unit on a scalable city wall hex that cannot evade,
or elects not to evade, will battle first (treat the defending unit
as if it possesses a First Strike card, and treat the combat as
a First Strike combat) when being attacked in Close Combat
unless the attacking enemy unit is also on an adjacent scalable
city wall hex.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

Command & Colors: Ancients
Ranged Combat: A unit defending on a scalable city wall hex
may disregard one flag rolled against it. Standard line of sight
rules apply, and adjacent enemy units prevent Ranged Combat.
A Command card or leader that adds additional dice in battle will
modify the maximum number of battle dice that may be rolled.

Line of Sight: A scalable city wall hex blocks line of sight to
units behind the scalable city wall hex and vise versa. Line of
sight is not blocked between units on the same scalable city wall
looking along the scalable city wall hexes.

Fortified City Walls

(use rampart terrain hexes for fortified city walls)
Movement: Fortified City Walls are normally considered impassable terrain for all units, unless siege rules are in effect, as noted
in the scenario special rules. When siege rules are in effect, the
attacking foot units have scaling ladders, and fortified city walls
are treated as scalable walls.
Battle: No battle possible unless siege rules are in effect for
the scenario.
Line of Sight: A fortified city wall hex blocks line of sight to
units behind the fortified city wall hex and vise versa.

Marsh

Movement: A unit or unattached leader must
stop when it moves onto a marsh hex and move
no further on that turn. The unit or unattached
leader must also roll one battle die for a possible
block loss. One unit block is lost when the unit’s
symbol is rolled. A leader is eliminated when a leader symbol is
rolled. Retreating or evading units or leaders do not have to stop
when entering a marsh hex. A unit or leader that must retreat or
evades onto or through a marsh hex must still check for a possible block loss for each marsh hex it retreats or evades onto or
through. Marsh block loss die rolls are made prior to removing
unit blocks for unfulfilled map edge hex retreats.
A unit or leader that leaves a marsh hex may only move onto an
adjacent hex regardless of its normal movement allowance.

A war machine unit may not move, evade or retreat onto a marsh
hex.
Battle: A unit may battle the turn it moves onto a marsh hex.
When battling an enemy unit on a marsh hex, a maximum of
2 battle dice are rolled in Close Combat. A unit that elects to
advance onto a marsh hex after a successful Close Combat must
check for possible block loss. A unit on a marsh hex battling
out will roll a maximum of 2 battle dice in Close Combat, and
1 die in Ranged Combat. A unit on a marsh hex that has not
already moved this turn, may make a Momentum Advance out
of the marsh hex onto the vacated hex after a successful Close
Combat, but cavalry units may not make a Special Momentum
Advance.
A Command card that adds additional dice in battle will modify
the maximum number of battle dice that can be rolled.
Line of Sight: A Marsh hex does not block line of sight.

17 Special Units & Rules

NOTE: These rules are not used in the scenarios with the base
game but are found in the expansions. For completeness, we
include them here.

Special Unit Blocks

The first expansion introduced the concept of
“special units” to represent the elite units of the
Ancient World, such as Alexander’s Companion
Cavalry or the Persian Immortals. When special
units are present in a battle, they will be labeled on the battlefield,
and the scenario instructions will specify that a Special Unit block
will be placed in each special unit’s hex. The special rules will
provide the increased abilities for each special unit. The Special
Unit block moves with the unit. It does not count as a block that
can be removed to satisfy losses. This block is not transferable
to any other unit. If the special unit is eliminated, this block is
removed from the map along with the last block of the unit.

The only scenario in the base game which really features an
appropriate “special unit” is the Carthaginian Sacred Band
unit, found in the Crimissos River Battle Scenario. It was an
elite unit, so if you wish to replay this battle scenario with a
more historically accurate Sacred Band, use the special abilities
outlined below:
On the battlefield, the Sacred band is the heavy infantry unit
directly below the hex containing the Hasdrubal leader. Place a
distinct marker of some kind in the hex with the Sacred Band
unit to distinguish it from other Carthaginian units.
Sacred Band special abilities:

• The Sacred Band will score one hit for each leader symbol
rolled in close combat. A leader does not have to be attached
or in an adjacent hex to confer this benefit.
• The Sacred Band may ignore one flag.

• The Sacred Band retains these special abilities until the last
block of the unit has been removed from the battlefield.

Marian/Imperial Legions Rule

When this rule is in effect, medium and heavy Roman infantry
units are armed with pilum and sword. These units are considered missile weapon capable units and must follow the rules for
Ranged Combat when utilizing that capability.

Each medium and heavy Roman infantry unit has a range of two
hexes and will roll 1 battle die when it holds or moves only one
hex. As with other missile weapon capable units, These units may
not perform both Ranged and Close Combat in the same turn.

Julian Legions Rule

When the Julian Legions Rule is in effect, all Roman heavy
infantry and medium infantry units are armed with pilum and
sword and will follow the rules for Ranged Combat units, per
the Marian/Imperial Legions Rule.
In addition, all Roman heavy infantry and medium infantry units
may move one hex and combat as normal, or may move 2 hexes
and not battle.

Command & Colors: Ancients

18. Command Cards
Section Cards (27 cards)

Section cards are used to order units and/or leaders in a specific
section of the battlefield to move and/or battle. These cards
indicate in which section of the battlefield you may order units
or leaders and how many units or leaders you may order. All
Section Command cards have a leader helmet symbol on the
card, to remind players that one or more attached leaders in the
section may be ordered to detach and move separately (for the
cost of one order each) when the card is played.
Order Two Units Left: Issue an order
to two units and/or leaders in the left
section. (3 cards)

foot units, including auxilia may move
through a friendly unit. If you do not
have any light units, you may order 1
unit of your choice. (4 cards)
	 Light unit types: Light infantry, light
bow infantry, light sling infantry,
auxilia, light cavalry, light bow
cavalry and barbarian chariot.

Order Medium Troops: Issue orders to
a number of medium foot and medium
mounted units less than or equal to your Command. If you do
not have any medium units, you may order 1 unit of your choice.
(3 cards)
Medium unit types: Medium infantry, warrior, medium cavalry,
camel and cataphracted camel.

Order Two Units Center: Issue an
order to two units and/or leaders in the
center section. (4 cards)

Order Heavy Troops: Issue orders to a number of heavy foot
and heavy mounted units less than or equal to your Command.
If you do not have any heavy units, you may order 1 unit of your
choice. (2 cards)

Order Two Units Right: Issue an order
to two units and/or leaders in the right
section. (3 cards)
Order Three Units Left: Issue an order to three units and/or
leaders in the left section. (3 cards)
Order Three Units Center: Issue an order to three units and/or
leaders in the center section. (4 cards)
Order Three Units Right: Issue an order to three units and/or
leaders in the right section. (3 cards)
Order Four Units Left: Issue an order to four units and/or leaders in the left section. (1 card)
Order Four Units Center: Issue an order to four units and/or
leaders in the center section. (1 card)
Order Four Units Right: Issue an order to four units and/or
leaders in the right section. (1 card)
Coordinated Attack: Issue orders to one unit and/or leader in
each section. (2 cards)
Out Flanked: Issue an order to two units and/or leaders in the left
section and two units or leaders in the right section. (2 cards)

Troop Cards (10 cards)

Troop cards allow you to order a specific unit type (Example:
light, medium) to move and/or battle. Unless the card states
otherwise, you may freely choose Foot or Mounted units... So
“Order Light” means you can issue your allotment of orders to
any combination of light Foot units or light Mounted units. Ordered units may be in any section of the battlefield. The number
of units you may order is equal to your side’s Command, i.e.
the maximum number of cards you may hold in your hand on
that turn. (See “Command” under section 7 of the rules, ‘Order
Units and Leaders’.)
Order Light Troops: Issue orders to a number of light foot and
light mounted units less than or equal to your Command. Light

Heavy unit types: Heavy infantry, heavy war machines,
heavy cavalry, heavy cataphracted cavalry, heavy chariot and
elephant.
Order Mounted Troops: Issue orders to a number of mounted
units and/or leaders less than or equal to your Command. If you
do not have any mounted units, you may order 1 unit of your
choice. (1 card)
	 Mounted unit types: Light cavalry, light bow cavalry,
barbarian chariot, medium cavalry, camel, cataphracted camel,
heavy cavalry, heavy cataphracted cavalry, heavy chariot and
elephant.

Leadership Cards (6 cards)

Leadership cards allow you to order a leader, any unit to which
the leader is attached, plus a given number of units or leaders in
adjacent linked hexes to move and/or battle. Units in “adjacent
linked hexes” may be in different sections of the battlefield,
as long as each ordered unit is adjacent to at least one other
ordered unit, and at least one of the ordered units is adjacent to
the designated leader. In this way, a Leadership order enables
you to order a “chain” or “wing” of units to move and/or battle
in a coordinated fashion. A leader may not detach on a Leadership Command card.

The two examples above show two possible ways a leadership card can be used to activate a leader’s hex plus four
adjacent linked hexes.

© 2009 GMT Games, LLC

Command & Colors: Ancients
Leadership Any Section: Issue orders to units under one leader’s
command (leader’s hex and 3 adjacent linked hexes) or order one
unit of your choice. (3 cards)
Inspired Left Leadership: Issue orders to units under one
leader’s command in the left section (leader’s hex and 4 adjacent
linked hexes) or order one unit of your choice. (1 card)
Inspired Center Leadership: Issue orders to units under one
leader’s command in the center section (leader’s hex and 4 adjacent linked hexes) or order one unit of your choice. (1 card)
Inspired Right Leadership: Issue orders to units under one
leader’s command in the right section (leader’s hex and 4 adjacent
linked hexes) or order one unit of your choice. (1 card)

Tactic Cards (17 cards)

Tactic cards allow ordered units to move and/or battle in ways
not allowed in the basic rules. Actions ordered on Tactic cards
take precedence over basic rules.
Command cards that state ‘order units equal to command’ means
the maximum number of units you may order is equal to your
side’s Command (see 7: Order Units and Leaders).
NOTE: on Tactic Command cards, Ranged Combat is sometimes
referred to as Fire.
Clash of Shields: Order all units adjacent to the enemy. Units battle with 2
additional dice in Close Combat. Units
may not move before Close Combat
but may Momentum Advance after
successful Close Combat. If eligible for
bonus Close Combat, units battle with
normal number of battle dice. Ordered
units may not have Ranged Combat.
(1 card)

23

NOTE: This means all ranged weapons units are considered
“ordered.” While a unit cannot range fire if adjacent an enemy
unit, if that changes during battling (perhaps because of fire
from some other unit that eliminates or forces the adjacent unit
to retreat), then the newly released unit is still ordered and may
range fire.
Double Time: Order 4 or fewer foot
units in a group (units in adjacent linked
hexes that may span two sections). Each
ordered unit (except war machines)
may move two hexes and still engage
in Close Combat. Warrior units may
move 2 or 3 hexes, but must engage in
Close Combat after doing so. Ordered
units may not have Ranged Combat. If
you do not have any foot units, order 1
unit of your choice. (2 cards)
NOTE: Light foot units do not gain any movement advantage
when part of a Double Time order. The Double Time card symbolizes the final rush into Close Combat. Light foot units generally preferred to avoid Close Combat so they don’t have a move
advantage. However, auxilia foot units gain a battle advantage
when part of a Double Time order, as they can move 2 and still
Close Combat.
First Strike: Play this card after opponent declares a Close
Combat, but before the dice roll. Your defending unit will battle
first. If opponent’s unit is neither eliminated nor retreats, it may
Battle as originally ordered. out its attack normally. At the end of
the turn, you draw your new Command card first. (1 card)

NOTE: Regardless of the outcome of your First Strike, your unit
is not eligible to Battle Back.

NOTE: All units adjacent to an enemy unit when this card is
played are ordered. This can get a little confusing, especially
as combats take place and enemy units are forced to retreat. We
suggest that you mark the units eligible to battle before you start
your Close Combats.
Counter Attack: Issue the same order
that your opponent just played. When
countering Section cards and Inspired
Leadership cards, the right section
becomes left, the left section becomes
right. When countering Leadership Any
Section, your orders must be in the same
section your opponent chose. (2 cards)
NOTE: You cannot use Counter Attack
on a First Strike card.

Darken the Sky: All ranged weapon units may fire twice. No
movement—only fire. Each Ranged Combat is resolved separately. If you do not have any units with ranged weapons, order
1 unit of your choice. (1 card)

I Am Spartacus: Roll dice equal to Command. For each unit
symbol rolled, one unit of this type is ordered. A leader symbol
orders any unit or leader. Units may be ordered in any section.
Ordered units battle with 1 additional die this turn. Reshuffle
Deck & Discards! (1 card)
NOTE: Before drawing a new card, reshuffle the deck with the
discards, including this card, to form a new draw deck. Cards
in the player’s hands are not reshuffled.
Line Command: Order a group of foot
units. The group must be in adjacent
linked hexes (which may span two or
three sections). Each unit may move no
more than one hex and then engage in
Ranged Fire or Close Combat if eligible.
Units may Momentum Advance after
successful Close Combat and may be
eligible for bonus Close Combat. If you
do not have any foot units, order 1 unit
of your choice. (4 cards)

NOTE: Ordered units do not have to move to engage in combat.

Command & Colors: Ancients

24

Move-Fire-Move: Order light foot and light mounted units equal
to Command. Units may move, fire and move again. All units
moving first must do so before any fire. After all Ranged Combat,
units may move again. Order units may not Close Combat. No
Ranged Combat after second move. Light foot units, including
auxilia, may move through a friendly unit when moving two
hexes. If you do not have any light units, order 1 unit of your
choice. (2 cards)
PLAY NOTE: The three orders on this card are all optional—the
first move, the fire (Ranged Combat), and the second move. The
key here is that the all ordered units must complete their first move
before there is any Ranged Combat. After all Ranged Combat is
completed, ordered units may make a second move.
HISTORICAL NOTE: this card reflects the “hit and run” tactics often used by light units in ancient warfare to harass and
discomfit the enemy, before the heavier units engaged in close
combat.
Mounted Charge: Order mounted units equal to Command.
Units battle with 1 additional die in Close Combat, including
any bonus Close Combat. Heavy units may move three hexes
and still battle. Ordered units may not have ranged combat. If
you do not have any mounted units, order 1 unit of your choice.
(2 cards)
	 Mounted unit types: Light cavalry, light bow cavalry, barbarian
chariot, medium cavalry, camel, cataphracted camel, heavy
cavalry, heavy cataphracted cavalry, heavy chariot and
elephant.
NOTE: Heavy units that may move three hexes when given an
order to charge include heavy cavalry, heavy cataphracted cavalry, elephants, and heavy chariots.
Rally: Roll dice equal to Command.
For each unit type or leader symbol
rolled, one unit of the appropriate type
in or adjacent to a leader’s hex is rallied
(replace a block in the under strength
unit). Rallied units are ordered and may
move and battle. Elephant and chariot
units may not be rallied. If you do not
have any leaders, issue an order to 1 unit
of your choice. (1 card)

a leader can never be rallied, regardless of the die roll. Therefore only units which actually “regain” a block are considered
ordered when rallied. All leaders on the battlefield may be used
to rally under strength units.
EXAMPLE: A leader is attached to a medium infantry unit with
two blocks. He is adjacent to a friendly light unit and elephant
unit that have each lost a block. The rally dice are rolled, and the
results yield two leader helmets and two heavy unit red squares.
Each helmet result can be used to replace one lost block of any
eligible unit type. The player chooses to replace both lost blocks
in the medium infantry unit and none in the light unit. The medium
infantry unit is rallied and may be ordered to move and battle, but
the light unit is not rallied and may not be ordered. The elephant
unit cannot be rallied. Luckily, the player has another leader that
is adjacent to two heavy units that have each lost two blocks.
The player applies one red square result to each adjacent heavy
infantry unit, replacing one lost block in each unit. Both heavy
infantry units are rallied and may be ordered to move and battle.
The player had the option of applying both red square results
to only one heavy infantry unit; however, wanting to order both
units, he restored just one block to each.

						               													<description>From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C&amp;amp;C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Commands &amp;amp; Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Middle Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp;amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games, Inc., Commands &amp;amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
