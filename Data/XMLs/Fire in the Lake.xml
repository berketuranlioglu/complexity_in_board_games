1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.2 Components

Fire in the Lake is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent
and counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict during the main US period
in Vietnam, 1964-1972, up to the “Paris Peace”. Each player takes
the role of a Faction seeking to set the fate of South Vietnam: the
United States (US), North Vietnamese forces (NVA), the Republic
of Vietnam forces (ARVN), or the southern communist Viet Cong
(VC). Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence
or control the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve
their Faction’s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events,
victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player
Factions, enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.
Fire in the Lake is Volume IV in the COIN Series of games that
use similar rules to cover modern Insurgencies and other inter-factional conflicts. The Playbook lists major rules differences from
earlier volumes. This Second Edition alters Air Strike (4.2.3), the
Commitment Phase (6.5) and nine cards labeled “2nd Ed”.
Game set up is explained on pages 23-24 of this rule book. An
index on pages 21-22 lists and defines key game terms. Sequences
and options for player and non-player actions are summarized on
several aid sheets.

1.1 General Course of Play

Fire in the Lake—unlike many card-assisted war games—does not
use hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one
at time, with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event
card shows the order in which the Factions become Eligible to
choose between the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations
and Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries
the penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next
card. Coup cards mixed in with the Event cards provide periodic
opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as collecting
resources and influencing popular sympathies.

A complete set of Fire in the Lake includes:

•	 A 22”x34” mounted game board (1.3).
•	 A deck of 130 cards (5.0).
•	 229 olive, bright blue, red, yellow, and orange wooden playing
pieces, many embossed (1.4; see “Forces Pool” on the Spaces
List sheet for a complete listing).
•	 7 embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.2).
•	 6 black and 6 white pawns (3.1.1).
•	 A sheet of markers.
•	 2 Sequence of Play and Spaces List sheets (1.4.1, 2.0, 6.0).
•	 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0).
•	 A Random Spaces and Non-player Events sheet (8.2, 8.4).
•	 2 Non-player Operations foldouts (8.5-8.8).
•	 3 6-sided dice—1 blue, 1 red, 1 yellow.
•	 A background play book.
•	 This rule book.

1.3 The Map

The map shows South Vietnam and nearby areas divided into various
types of spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Provinces, Cities, and
Lines of Communication (LoCs) that are either Highways or the
Mekong river. All spaces—including LoCs—can hold forces. Towns
are not spaces, merely boundaries between adjacent LoCs (1.3.6)
1.3.2 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population value (Pop) of
0, 1, or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime (1.6) or Control (1.7) and some Insurgent actions.
Provinces are further distinguished as Highland, Lowland, or Jungle,
affecting Counterinsurgent Sweeps (3.2.3), Assaults (3.2.4), and
certain Events (5.0).

1.3.3 Cities. Cities similarly show Population value of 1, 2, or 6.
DESIGN NOTE: Each Population value represents about 500,000
citizens of South Vietnam.
1.3.4 LoCs. Each Line of Communication (LoC) space is either
Highway (road) or Mekong (river) or both and shows an Economic
value (Econ) of 0, 1, or 2 affecting ARVN Resource earnings (1.8,
6.2.3) and Viet Cong Taxation (4.5.1). NOTE: LoCs are spaces!
1.3.5 Foreign Countries. The map’s Provinces include parts of
North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. All other spaces are South
Vietnam (“The South”). Only NVA and VC may stack in North
Vietnam (1.4.2). US and ARVN may enter Laos or Cambodia spaces
normally, but at risk of later removal (6.4.1).
1.3.6 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any 2 spaces meeting one of the
following conditions are adjacent:
•	 Spaces that border on (touch) one another.
•	 Provinces that would touch but for separation by a LoC.
•	 LoCs or Provinces separated by Towns.

NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely terminate LoCs (1.3.1).

3

empty spaces to show the number of on-map Bases and Available
US Bases and Troops to help track earnings (6.2) and victory (7.0).
US and ARVN may have forces in the Out of Play box—neither
Available nor on the map—and US forces can become Casualties
(3.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.0, 6.5). Otherwise, forces removed from the map
go to Available.

•	 Unless otherwise instructed (by Event, 5.1.1), forces may only be
placed from or replaced with those in the Available boxes. A piece
to be replaced by a piece that is unavailable is simply removed
(EXCEPTION: Infiltrate, 4.4.1).
•	 Important: Factions while executing an Operation, Special
Activity, or Event to place their own forces may take them from
elsewhere on the map (including a Tunneled Base, losing the
Tunnel marker, 1.4.4) if and only if the desired force type is not
Available. EXCEPTION: The US player may do so only with
US-led Irregulars and any ARVN forces, not with US Troops nor
with US Bases.
EXAMPLES: NVA without Available Guerrillas could remove its
own during a Rally (3.3.1) to place them Underground. US Train
could take Police from another space if none Available.
1.4.2 Stacking. No more than 2 Bases (of any Factions) may occupy
a single Province or City. Bases may not occupy LoCs. Only NVA
and VC forces may occupy North Vietnam (1.3.5).
•	 Placing (such as Bases via Train 3.2.1, Rally 3.3.1, Event 5.1.1, or
Commitment 6.5) or moving forces may never violate stacking.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas and Special Forces are
either Underground—symbol end down—or Active—symbol end
up. Actions and Events flip them from one to the other state. Bases,
Troops, and Police are always Active. Always set up and place new
TYPES OF FORCES

ADJACENCY EXAMPLE: Quang Duc Province and Route 11 are
adjacent via Da Lat, as are Quang Duc and Khanh Hoa across
Route 21.

Cubes:

1.3.7 Coasts. Any spaces adjacent to blue ocean (including across
a LoC) are coastal, affecting the Amphibious Landing, Operation
Starlite, and USS New Jersey Events (5.0).
1.3.8 Overflow. Use “Overflow” boxes for
pieces that exceed the room in a space on the
map; place the lettered marker in that space.

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: US Troops
(olive cubes), ARVN Troops (yellow cubes) and Police (orange
cubes), NVA Troops (red cubes), NVA and VC Guerrillas, US and
ARVN Special Forces (SF), and all Factions’ Bases.

ARVN Rangers
(Special Forces):

DESIGN NOTE: ARVN Police represent both urban police and
rural militias such as Regional Forces and Popular Forces. US-led
Irregulars include both CIDG counter-guerrillas and US special
operations forces training them or operating on their own. Bases
represent command, training, and supply facilities as well as political administration.

US-led
Irregulars
(Special Forces):

1.4.1 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. A “Force Pool” inventory on the Spaces List sheet shows the number of pieces in the
game. Keep forces Available for placement in the Faction’s Available
Forces box (or the US-led Irregulars box). Place NVA and VC Bases
in the highest- and US Bases and Troops in the lowest-numbered

Guerrillas and SF Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla, it is
sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active).
Also, “moving” or “relocating” Guerrillas or SF does not affect
Underground status unless specified.
1.4.4 Tunnels. Scenario Setup (2.1) and
Events (5.0) designate certain VC or NVA
Bases as Tunneled. Place an appropriate
Tunnel marker on such a Base, never
more than 1 Tunnel marker at a time per Base. Tunneled Bases are
harder to remove by Operations or Events (3.2.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.3,
5.1.1). When a Tunneled Base is removed, so is the Tunnel marker.
NVA can Infiltrate a VC Tunneled Base to make it NVA (4.4.1).

1.5 Players & Factions

The game may have up to 4 players, each as 1 or more Factions:
the US (olive), the NVA (red), the ARVN (yellow and orange), or
the VC (blue). In a 1-player game, the player plays US and ARVN
together, or NVA and VC, or any 1 Faction (8.9). Leftover Factions
are controlled either by rules section 8 as “Non-Players” or, if preferred with 2 or 3 players, as below.
No Non-Player Option: With 2 or 3 players, the players
(rather than the Non-Player rules, 8.0) may control any leftover
Factions:

•	 With 2 players, 1 player controls NVA and VC, the other US
and ARVN.
•	 With 3 players, a single player controls NVA and VC or, if
preferred, US and ARVN.

POLITBURO: A combined NVA/VC player uses the higher
victory margin of the 2 Factions during Coup Rounds (winning
if either meets its condition, 6.1, 7.2), but uses the lower of the
2 after Final Coup (7.3).
SOVEREIGNTY: A US/ARVN player uses the lower victory
margin of the 2 Factions (7.3) and only causes play to end on
a victory check (6.1, 7.2) if both are meeting their conditions.
DESIGN NOTE: NVA, VC, and ARVN pieces draw their colors as
much as possible from their respective flags, US from the olive GI
uniform.
1.5.1 Friends and Enemies. US and ARVN are Counterinsurgent
(COIN) Factions and friendly to each other; NVA and VC are Insurgents and friendly to each other. Counterinsurgents are enemy
to Insurgents.
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. All negotiations are open. The rules do not bind
players to agreements.
•	 The NVA and VC may voluntarily transfer up to half Resources
(1.8) to each other at any time that one of them is executing an
Operation, Special Activity, or Event.

1.6 Support and Opposition

Support and Opposition affect victory and some operations and
activities.

1.6.1 Cities and Provinces with at least 1 Population (1.3.2-3) always
show 1 of 5 levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime that can shift during play:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Active Support.
Passive Support.
Neutral.
Passive Opposition.
Active Opposition.

1.6.2 Active Support or Opposition counts double Population for
Total Support or Opposition—affecting US or VC victory (7.2-.3).
Show Support or Opposition with markers placed in each City or
Province. Show Neutral spaces by the absence of such markers.
Neutral

Total Support =

2 x Pop in Active Support + 1 x Pop in Passive Support

Total Opposition =

2 x Pop in Active Opposition + 1 x Pop in Passive Oppostion
NOTE: LoCs (1.3.4) and Pop 0 Provinces are always Neutral, never
at Support or Opposition.

1.7 Control

The 2 Counterinsurgent Factions together
(US and ARVN) Control a Province or City
if their pieces there combined exceed those
of the other 2 Factions (NVA and VC) combined. The NVA alone Control a Province or City if NVA pieces
exceed all other pieces (including VC). Control affects certain activities and victory. Adjust COIN Control and NVA Control markers
as Control changes due to placement, removal, or movement of
pieces.

1.8 Resources, Aid, and Patronage

At any moment, each Faction except the US has between 0 and 75
Resources that it uses to pay for Operations (3.0). During Coup
Rounds (6.2.3), a level of Aid (between 0 and 75) is added to ARVN
Resources. A level of Patronage (0 to 75) contributes to ARVN
victory (7.0). Mark Resources, Aid, and Patronage on the edge
track—for Resources, with a cylinder of that Faction’s color (1.5).
DESIGN NOTE: Patronage represents the wherewithal of the Saigon
regime to reward its friends at the expense of the population, such
as by diverting foreign aid—a means of governance that the US
could view as corrupt.

1.8.1 Joint Operations. The US does not track its own
Resources. Some US Operations (3.1) and US Pacification (3.2.1, 6.3.1) spend ARVN Resources. The US
may only spend those ARVN Resources that exceed
the marked Total Econ level (1.3.4, 6.2.3). Only the ARVN Faction
may spend ARVN Resources at or below Econ.

Faction. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing
Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the same
options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction
Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.

1.9 Victory Markers

Similarly track with markers on the edge track the following totals
that affect victory (7.0).

•	 Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of US Troops and Bases
Available (1.4.1).
•	 Total Population Controlled by the NVA plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map (1.7).
•	 Total Population Controlled by the COIN Factions (1.7) plus
Patronage (1.8).
•	 Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus the number of VC Bases on the map.
NOTE: A marker on “The Trail” track records the efficiency level of
the NVA’s North-to-South supply network (6.7). Twelve “Deception”
markers are for victory-related optional rules (7.3).

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions on the last 2 pages of this rule book to choose
a scenario and various play options, assign Factions to players,
prepare the draw deck, and set up markers and forces.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of the
draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played first; the card
on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE: Players will see
1 card ahead into the deck (2.3.7). All played cards and the number
of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the Sequence
of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Coup Rounds [6.0], advance
the Coup Card marker).

2.3 Event Card

When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event.

•	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction symbols shown at top
of the card.
•	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event
on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card
in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.6). Factions that did are Ineligible. (All
Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free Operations, 3.1.2.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost symbol
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible to
execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost is the
2nd Eligible. NOTE: Light halos and gray rifles at some Faction
symbols relate only to Non-player instructions (8.4.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction (only!) opts to Pass,
it remains Eligible for the next card and receives +1 Resource if
an Insurgent Faction or adds +3 ARVN Resources if either COIN

2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.
FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass (2.3.3),
it may execute either:

•	 An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—or
•	 The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction does
not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation or possibly the
Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
•	 Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
•	 Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction may
execute a Limited Operation or instead execute the Event.
•	 Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special Activity
if desired.
NOTE: The game board and Sequence of Play aid sheet also show
these options. To qualify as executed, an Operation must occur in
at least one space (even if no effect) or (for NVA Rally) Improve the
Trail; Patrol inherently does so.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is an Operation in
just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited Operation is a
Patrol (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2), it can involve pieces
from multiple spaces but only 1 destination space. A Limited Operation counts as an Operation. (See also Non-player Operations, 8.1).
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events
(or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders
on the Sequence of Play track as follows:
•	 Any Faction that did not execute an Operation or Event (and was
not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
•	 Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise
specified by the Event; see also Free Operations, 3.1.2).

PLAY NOTE: Some Events (5.0) will enable the executing Faction
to remain Eligible or render other Factions Ineligible through the
next card. As a reminder, mark a Faction thus remaining Eligible by
placing its cylinder at the left edge of its Sequence of Play “Event”
box. Mark a Faction thus rendered Ineligible by placing its cylinder
with (under) the executing Faction’s, to show that it will be Ineligible
for the next card.
2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw deck’s
next card (even if the played card is Coup!, 2.4). Play the played
card, proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
2.3.8 Pivotal Events. Each Faction begins the Medium and Full
scenarios (only, 2.1) with a Pivotal Event card unique to it. Pivotal
Events are a type of Event (5.0). A Faction may play its Pivotal
Event to cancel a currently played Event card (including Eligibility
order, 2.3) if:

•	
•	
•	
•	

That Faction is Eligible, AND
The red pre-condition on the card is met, AND
The 1st Eligible Faction has not yet done anything, AND
No Coup is showing as the next card (2.3.9).

PROCEDURE: The Faction interrupts the usual Sequence of Play
by placing its Pivotal Event card on the played Event card and executing the Pivotal Event. The new Eligibility sequence follows, and
the Pivotal Event stays in the played card pile, as normal.
TRUMPING PIVOTAL EVENTS: The VC may play its Pivotal
Event on top of another Faction’s Pivotal Event, canceling it;
ARVN may do so to US or NVA; NVA may do so to US; US may
not do so. A canceled Pivotal Event card is returned to its owner
for possible later use.
PLAY NOTES: The 1st Eligible Faction need not declare what it
would execute before a Faction must decide whether to play its
Pivotal Event. Place “Playable Pivotal Event” reminder markers
on unplayed Pivotal Event cards for which preconditions are met.
2.3.9 Monsoon Season. On the last Event card before each Coup
Card (2.4), Operations may not include Sweep (3.2.3, even via
Advise, 4.2.1) nor March (3.3.2), US Air Strikes and Air Lifts are
limited to 2 spaces (4.2.2-.3), and no Pivotal Events allowed (2.3.8).
(But see 5.1.1 regarding Event text.)
NOTE: Keep the “Monsoon” marker near the deck and place it on
the played Event card as a reminder while a Coup is showing as
the next card.

2.4 Coup Card

If playing a Coup Card, first carry out any immediate instructions on
the card. Then place the card in the box marked “RVN Leader” (see
below). Finally, conduct a Coup Round (6.0), marking each phase
on the Sequence of Play with the “Coup Card” marker.
2.4.1 RVN Leader. The top (most recently played) Coup card (or
the “RVN Leader” box, if empty) shows the current Republic of
Vietnam (RVN) Leader. Any lingering effects noted for that Leader
are in effect, as if it is the text of a lingering executed Event (5.1,
5.3, 5.4). If the most recently played card is “Failed Attempt”, place
it underneath any previous Coup cards. NOTE: “Failed Attempts”
cancel only “Duong Van Minh”. Minh is an RVN Leader but not
a card. Minh thus does not count as a card in the RVN Leader box
(such as for Pivotal Event pre-conditions, 2.3.8). “Nguyen Cao Ky”
will affect Pacification beginning with that Coup Round (6.3.1).
2.4.2 Final Coup. If the last Coup card’s Round is completed without
a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine victory by 7.3.
NOTE: Each series of Event cards up to a Coup is a “Campaign”,
representing 1-2 years of war.

3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General

A Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction sheet and selects the map spaces (typically
several) to be involved. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation.
Operations usually cost Resources (not Aid or Patronage,1.8), often per
space selected; the paying Faction must have enough Resources to pay
for the Operation, including in each selected space. The US does not
spend Resources of its own; it sometimes spends ARVN Resources,
but may not do so below the marked Total Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3).
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which
the Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions (1.5) or pieces to be
affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed, replaced,
or moved. An Operation may target both enemies or just one and
ignore the other. NOTE: Allied forces nevertheless protect the Bases
of the other friendly Faction from Assault/Attack (3.2.4, 3.3.3). Once
targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent possible. Actions affecting another Faction’s pieces, friendly or enemy,
do not require that Faction’s permission.
3.1.1 Pawns. If desired, mark spaces selected for Operations (3.0),
Special Activities (4.0), or other actions with white and black pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Operations
or Special Activities: they cost no Resources and, if executed by a
Faction other than the one playing an Event, do not affect its Eligibility (2.3.6). EXCEPTIONS: Pacification, Agitation, and Trail
Improvement still cost Resources even if part of a free Operation
(3.2.1, 3.3.1). Other requirements and procedures still apply unless
modified by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).

3.2 COIN Operations

The US and ARVN choose from Train, Patrol, Sweep,
and Assault Operations. NOTE: These Factions never
place or move pieces into North Vietnam (1.4.2).
3.2.1 Train. Training adds ARVN forces and can build Support (1.6)
or drop Patronage (1.8). NOTE: The US gets its Troops and Bases
in and out of Vietnam via the Commitment Phase (6.5) and Events
(5.0), not Operations.
•	 ARVN may select any Provinces or Cities without NVA Control.
•	 The US may select any Provinces or Cities that have US pieces.
•	 Either Faction spends 3 ARVN Resources only if it places any
ARVN pieces (including replacing cubes with a Base).

PROCEDURE: First, in each of those selected spaces desired, if US,
place 1-2 Irregulars or, at US Bases, 1-2 Rangers or up to 6 ARVN
cubes (any combination of Troops and Police); if ARVN, place 1-2
Rangers or up to 6 ARVN cubes at Cities or at US or ARVN Bases.
If none of the desired ARVN pieces are Available (1.4.1), they may
be taken from the map. Then, in 1 selected space (even if a Limited
Operation, 2.3.5), if desired either:

•	 Pacify to remove any Terror marker and then to shift the space
up to 2 levels toward Active Support. The space must have COIN
Control and, if ARVN Training, both ARVN Troops and Police.
(Unlike Pacification during the Support Phase, 6.3.1, the US does
not need Troops and Police, only a US piece and COIN Control.)
The Pacification costs 3 ARVN Resources per Terror marker

removed and level shifted, even if the Training Operation was
free (3.1.2, 5.5). OR
•	 If ARVN, replace any 3 ARVN cubes with 1 ARVN Base (within
stacking,1.4.2). NOTE: Replacing cubes with a Base costs 3 ARVN
Resources even if no cubes were placed. OR
•	 If US and the space is Saigon, transfer up to 3 Patronage to ARVN
Resources.
3.2.2 Patrol. Patrolling protects LoCs by moving Troops or Police
onto them and finding and removing Insurgents there. If ARVN,
pay 3 Resources total (not per space); if US, the cost is 0. If a
Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end on a single
destination space.
PROCEDURE: Move any number of your Faction’s cubes from
any spaces. Each cube may move into any adjacent LoC or City
and may keep entering adjacent LoCs or Cities until the player
chooses to stop moving it or it enters a space with any NVA or VC
piece. Then, in each LoC (whether or not a cube just moved there),
Activate 1 enemy Guerrilla for each of your Faction’s cubes there.
Then, if desired, Assault (3.2.4) in 1 LoC at no added cost. US may
not add ARVN. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the Assault must be
in the destination LoC.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweeps may move Troops and can locate enemy Guerrillas. Select Provinces or Cities as destinations (not North Vietnam,
1.4.2). If ARVN, pay 3 Resources per space selected; if US, 0. Sweep
is not allowed in Monsoon (a Coup card showing as next, 2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: First, simultaneously move any of your Faction’s
adjacent Troops desired into selected spaces. In addition, each group
of Troops may first move onto an adjacent LoC (1.3.3) that is free
of NVA/VC and then into an adjacent space. (Any Troops that move
must reach spaces paid for as destinations.)

•	 Then, in each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) 1 enemy Guerrilla
for each of your cubes (moved or already there) or Special Forces
(Irregulars for US, Rangers for ARVN).
•	 In Jungle spaces, Activate only 1 enemy Guerrilla for every 2 of
your cubes or Special Forces (round odd totals down).
SWEEP EXAMPLE: ARVN selects Quang Duc for a Sweep. No LoCs
have Guerrillas. Two Troops move from Cam Ranh onto Route 11
and from there via Da Lat into Quang Duc Province. ARVN Troops
in Binh Tuy – Binh Thuan also could enter Quang Duc.

3.2.4 Assault. Assaults remove enemy pieces. Select any spaces with
the executing Faction’s cubes and Insurgents (NVA or VC). ARVN
pay 3 Resources per space. US Assault costs 3 ARVN Resources only
if the US player opts to add an ARVN Assault in 1 US Assault space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove enemy pieces per
the number of cubes there, as follows.

•	 If an ARVN Assault, count only ARVN cubes. Remove 1 enemy
piece for every 2 cubes there or every 3 in Highland (round down).
In Cities or on LoCs, count Police as well as Troops; in Provinces,
Troops only. For each Base removed (including via follow up to
US Assault, below, or Advise, 4.2.1), add +6 Aid.
•	 If a US Assault, count US Troops. Remove 2 enemies per US
Troops cube if the space has a US Base, or only 1 enemy for
every 2 US Troops (round down) if Highland with no US Base,
or otherwise 1 enemy piece for each US Troop. If desired, pay
3 ARVN Resources to follow up with an ARVN Assault per the
above bullet in 1 space where US Assault just occurred (no effect
on ARVN Eligibility, 2.3.1).

7

TROOPS FIRST, BASES LAST: Remove any NVA Troops in an
Assault space first, then any Active NVA or VC Guerrillas (Assaulting Faction chooses which first), then any Insurgent Bases only
once no NVA nor VC Guerrillas remain. Remove no Underground
Guerrillas (1.4.3).
NOTE: Underground Guerrillas in a space prevent further removal
via Assault of Bases until the Guerrillas are Activated. Also, nonBase pieces protect the Bases of the other friendly Faction from
Assault/Attack (3.3.3).
DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less hard hitting than Troops but
enjoy an information advantage in that counterinsurgents must
Activate (locate) them before Assaulting them.
TUNNELS: If the next piece to be removed would be a Base with a
Tunnel marker (1.4.4), stop removing pieces from that space. Instead,
roll a die: on a 1-3, do nothing further; on a 4-6, remove that Tunnel
marker only (leave the Base in place). EXAMPLE: Three US Troops
Assault 2 Tunneled Bases alone in Jungle. No pieces are removed.
On a roll of 4-6, a Tunnel marker is removed from one Base.

3.3 Insurgent Operations

The NVA and VC choose from Rally, March, Attack, or
Terror Operations.

3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment friendly forces, recover VC,
and build the Trail. Select any Provinces or Cities without Support
(1.6). Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction places
1 of its Available Guerrillas or replaces 2 of its Guerrillas with 1 of
its Bases (within stacking 1.4.2). If the space already has at least 1
of that Faction’s Bases, the Faction may instead:

•	 If NVA, place a number of its Guerrillas up to the sum of Trail
value (6.7) plus the number of NVA Bases there.
•	 If VC, place its Guerrillas up to the sum of the space’s Population
value (1.3.2-.3) plus the number of VC Bases there OR flip all its
Guerrillas there Underground (1.4.3). NOTE: VC may Agitate as
well if it has the shaded “Cadres” Capability (5.3); that Agitation
costs Resources even if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
Then, NVA with its Rally may spend another 2 Resources to Improve
the Trail by 1 box (6.7, even if the Rally was a Limited Operation,
2.3.5, or selected 0 spaces). Rally to Improve the Trail costs 2 even
if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
3.3.2 March. March Operations move Insurgent Guerrillas and
Troops. Moving pieces may begin in any spaces. Pay 1 Resource
per Province or City that Guerrillas or Troops move into (0 Resources to move onto LoCs). A Limited Operation (2.3.5) March
may select only a single destination space. March is not allowed in
Monsoon (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas
or Troops desired into adjacent spaces (1.3.6). Pieces moving from 1
space to another move as a single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving
group to Active (1.4.3) if:

•	 The destination is a LoC or has any Support (1.6) AND
•	 The moving group’s number of pieces plus the number of US and
ARVN cubes, Irregulars, and Rangers at the destination exceeds 3.
EXAMPLE: Two Underground VC Guerrillas March from The
Parrot’s Beak into Kien Phong, where there are 2 Police cubes and
Support. The total of 4 relevant pieces at the destination exceeds 3,

Fire in the Lake

so the VC Guerrillas flip to Active.
THE TRAIL: Marching NVA Guerrillas and Troops (not VC) may
continue moving into additional spaces (paying once only for each
added destination) if the previous destination space was in Laos or
Cambodia (1.3.5), the Trail value is above 0 (6.7), and the March is
not a LimOp (2.3.5). Also, if the Trail value is 4, NVA March into
or out of individual Laos or Cambodia spaces costs 0 Resources.
NOTE: COIN Control does not stop such moves (1.7).
3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces.
Select any spaces where the executing Faction and an enemy have
pieces; pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the
executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less
than or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas
there (whether or not they began Active), remove up to 2 enemy
pieces (executing Faction’s choice). The NVA may instead remove
1 enemy piece per 2 NVA Troops there (round down, Activate no
Guerrillas). Removed pieces may belong to different Factions and
may be Underground Special Forces.
•	 Do not remove US or ARVN Bases before any other pieces of
either Faction in the space.

CASUALTIES: Place any US pieces removed by Attack into the
Casualties box.
ATTRITION: For each US Troop cube or US Base removed, the
Attacking Faction must remove 1 of its Attacking pieces (Troops
or Guerrillas, whichever used) from the space.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Cities or Provinces affect Support and Opposition (1.6) and
place Terror markers that hinder future efforts to
influence it. On LoCs, they place Sabotage markers that block ARVN
Resource earnings (6.2.1). Select any spaces where the executing
Faction has at least 1 Underground Guerrilla or, for NVA Terror, NVA
Troop cube; pay 1 Resource per Province or City (0 for LoCs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 of the executing Faction’s Underground
Guerrillas in each selected space (if any there).

•	 If the space is a Province or City without a Terror marker, place
a Terror marker. If VC, shift 1 level toward Active Opposition
(1.6). If NVA, shift any Support 1 level toward Neutral.
•	 If the space is a LoC without a Sabotage marker, place a Sabotage
marker.
•	 Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on the
map. (There are 15.)
NOTE: Terror Ops will not add Terror or Sabotage markers to
spaces that already have them. (Certain events can do so, 5.1.1).

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General

When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes
an Operation (3.0), it may also execute 1 type of its Special Activities (EXCEPTION: Limited Operations, 2.3.5). There is no added
Resource cost for the Special Activity. As with Operations, the
executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or pieces affected and
the order of actions. Select a given space only once as a location
for a given Special Activity. (But see removal of adjacent pieces
via Ambush from Road/River locations, 4.4.3). Events may grant
free Special Activities (not further affecting Eligibility, 3.1.2, 5.5).

•	 Important: A Faction may execute its Special Activity at any one
time immediately before, during, or immediately after its Operation.
EXAMPLE: The VC Rally until at 0 Resources, then pause to Tax
and gain Resources, then continue to Rally in added spaces.
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity, the
2nd Eligible receives the option of executing the card’s Event, and
vice versa (2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities either must occur or may not occur where
their Accompanying Operations occurred. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operations and take place
in any otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 US Special Activities

The US may choose from Advise, Air Lift, or Air Strike
Special Activities.

4.2.1 Advise. Advise strikes with indigenous allied forces and can
add to Aid (1.8). It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1.2) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces NOT selected for Training (never
North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:

•	 Sweep within the space with ARVN forces as if an ARVN Sweep
there without movement (3.2.3, not in Monsoon, 2.3.9), OR
•	 Assault there as if ARVN Assault (3.2.4), OR
•	 Activate 1 Underground Irregular or Ranger there to remove 2
enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed
(Underground Guerrillas may).
Then, if desired, add +6 Aid total (to max of 75).
4.2.2 Air Lift. Air Lift moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move any US Troops and up to 4 ARVN Troops,
Rangers, or Irregulars among any 4 spaces (2 spaces during Monsoon, 2.3.9; not North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
4.2.3 Air Strike. Air Strike destroys exposed Insurgent units and
can degrade the Trail. It may take place in up to 6 spaces (2 spaces
during Monsoon, 2.3.9), each with any US or ARVN piece in it.
PROCEDURE: Roll a die. The die roll equals the number of Air
Strike hits achieved. Each Air Strike hit can be applied in either
of two ways. It takes 2 hits to Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7). It
takes 1 hit to remove 1 Active enemy piece (up to 6 pieces can be
removed even during Monsoon). Hits can be applied to both the
Trail and Active pieces, but the total hits may not exceed the die roll.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Fire in the Lake
•	 The Trail cannot be reduced by more than 1 box per Air Strike.
•	 Remove NVA Troops before any Guerrillas. Remove Bases only
from spaces where no other Insurgent pieces remain. Remove no
Underground Guerrillas nor Tunneled Bases.
•	 Shift each space where any piece removed 1 level toward Active
Opposition (if a Province or City with at least 1 Population, 1.6.1).
NOTE: Air Strike in this Second Edition alters the original.

4.3 ARVN Special Activities

The ARVN chooses from Govern, Transport, or Raid Special
Activities.

4.3.1 Govern. Governing adds Aid or extracts Patronage from Aid
and Support. It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1-.2)
and take place in 1 or 2 COIN-Controlled Provinces or Cities (1.7)
with any level of Support (1.6) NOT Saigon NOR selected for
Training. NOTE: ARVN may Train and Govern but not in the same
space during the same Op.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either:

•	 Add 3 times the space’s Population to Aid (to a maximum of 75),
OR
•	 Transfer its Population value (times 1) from Aid to Patronage
(max 75) and shift the space 1 level toward Neutral. There must
be more ARVN cubes (Troops and Police total) than US cubes
(Troops) in the space.
DESIGN NOTE: South Vietnamese officials may Govern benignly
to attract more foreign aid, or less benignly to divert more aid to
associates.
4.3.2 Transport. Transport moves Troops and Rangers, to take
control of countryside, for example, and prepares Rangers for Raids.
PROCEDURE: Select 1 space and move up to 6 ARVN Troops and/
or Rangers from there onto 1 or more adjacent LoCs, if desired.
They may continue to move along adjacent LoCs or through Cities
and then, if desired, into any adjacent destinations (not North Vietnam, 1.4.2). They must stop at any NVA or VC pieces. Then flip all
Rangers anywhere on the map to Underground.
4.3.3 Raid. Raiding repositions and strikes with the ARVN’s special
forces—Rangers. It may only accompany Patrol, Sweep, or Assault
(3.2.2-.4) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces.
PROCEDURE: Each selected space, move in any adjacent Rangers desired (keeping them either Underground or Active). Then, if
desired, Activate an Underground Ranger in each space to remove
2 enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed (Underground Guerrillas may).

9

the number of NVA Bases there, then replace any NVA Guerrillas
desired 1 for 1 with added NVA Troops, OR
•	 If NVA outnumber VC, shift any Opposition there by 1 level toward Neutral. Then replace any 1 VC piece desired with its NVA
counterpart. If replacing a VC Tunneled Base, flip the Tunnel
marker from VC to NVA. In order to remove VC, NVA must have
or make Available the NVA counterpart (1.4.1) and place it in the
VC’s place.
DESIGN NOTE: Infiltration of Northerners could dampen local
revolutionary zeal, as Hanoi’s interference replaced Saigon’s.
4.4.2 Bombard. Bombardment imposes losses on concentrated
enemy troops. It may occur in 1 or 2 spaces with any combination
of at least 3 ARVN and/or US Troops (Police and Special Forces
do not count) or with any US or ARVN Base. Each space also must
have in it or be adjacent to a space with at least 3 NVA Troops.
PROCEDURE: Remove 1 US or ARVN Troop cube from each
selected location, if US, to the Casualties box.
4.4.3 Ambush. Ambush enables the NVA to Attack on the move,
ensure the success of Attacks, and avoid attrition and exposure of
their Guerrillas. It may take place in 1 or 2 spaces selected and paid
for as March destinations (0 cost for LoCs, 3.3.2) or for Attack by
NVA Guerrillas (3.3.3, not yet resolved) on that accompanying Operation. At least 1 NVA Guerrilla that Marched into or will Attack
in each space must be Underground (1.4.3). A free Ambush per an
Event (5.5) occurs as if an Attack in the space.
NOTE: Ambush accompanying Attack modifies that Attack in that
space rather than adding a second Attack there.
PROCEDURE: The NVA Attack in each selected location (at no added cost in Resources). Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3),
the Attacks in those spaces each remove only 1 enemy piece (Bases
last) but Activate 1 Underground Guerrilla only and automatically
succeed (do not roll; remove the enemy piece normally). Also, do
not remove any NVA pieces even if US Troops removed.
ROAD/RIVER: If a selected Ambush space is a LoC (1.3.4), NVA
may remove the enemy piece from any adjacent space instead (Bases
last), even where another target was just removed. The LoC need not
have an enemy to be selected for Attack with Ambush.
EXAMPLE: An NVA Guerrilla Ambushing on the 2-Econ Mekong
could remove 1 enemy from either the Mekong, Kien Phong, Kien
Hoa, Can Tho, or Saigon. Selecting Kien Phong would not prevent
a 2nd NVA Guerrilla Ambushing there from also removing an enemy piece.

4.4 NVA Special Activities

The NVA choose from Infiltrate, Bombard, or Ambush Special Activities.

4.4.1 Infiltrate. Infiltration enables the NVA to build up its conventional forces or to take over VC forces. It also erodes Opposition.
It may only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2). Infiltrate 1 or 2
spaces that have either an NVA Base or more NVA pieces than VC
pieces.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either—

•	 If NVA Base(s), place NVA Troops up to the Trail value (6.7) plus

4.5 VC Special Activities

The VC may choose from Tax, Subvert, or Ambush Special
Activities.

5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence.
EXAMPLE: NVA executing “Plei Mei” could March as directed
even during Monsoon (2.3.9). However:

PROCEDURE: For each space, Activate 1 Underground VC Guerrilla there (1.4.3). Add the space’s Econ value or twice its Population
(1.3.2-.4) to VC Resources (1.8). If a Province or City, shift it 1 level
toward Active Support.

•	 Events may not violate stacking (and so never place Bases where
already 2, nor US or ARVN forces into North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
•	 Events place only Available pieces (1.4.1) and markers unless
specifying from out of play or Casualties; they remove rather than
replace if the replacement is not Available or if stacking (1.4.2)
would be violated.
•	 Events do not force removal of Tunneled Bases unless removal
of Tunneled Bases is explicitly stated (1.4.4). A Faction may opt
to remove its own Tunneled Base to fulfill Event text.
•	 Events may not raise Resources, Aid, or Patronage beyond 75 (1.8).

4.5.2 Subvert. Subversion replaces ARVN pieces with VC Guerrillas
and saps Patronage. It may only accompany Rally, March, or Terror
(3.3.1, -.2, -.4). It may occur in any 1 or 2 spaces with at least 1
Underground VC Guerrilla and any ARVN cubes.

5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence. EXAMPLE: US could Air Lift with “MACV” even
with “Typhoon Kate” in effect because MACV directs that “US ...
executes any 1 free Special Activity”.

PROCEDURE: In each space, remove any 2 ARVN cubes or replace
1 there with a VC Guerrilla. Then drop Patronage, -1 for every 2
ARVN pieces removed (or replaced) total (rounded down).

5.1.3 An executed Event’s text that can be implemented must be.
If not all of its text can be carried out, implement that which can.

4.5.1 Tax. Taxation enables the VC to gain Resources from areas
they inhabit. They may Tax up to 4 spaces that have Underground
VC Guerrillas and no COIN Control (1.7).
NOTE: There is no COIN Control of LoCs, so VC can Tax there
even if outnumbered. VC can Tax Sabotaged LoCs.

4.5.3 Ambush. VC Ambushes the same as NVA (4.4.3) but using
VC Guerrillas instead.

5.1.4 Pivotal Events are Events that have preconditions for play and
preempt other Event cards, including Faction order. The executing
Faction must select the Event to play the Pivotal Event card. (See
2.3.8.)

5.0 EVENTS

5.2 Dual Use

5.1 Executing Events

DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of the
same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject to
alternative historical interpretation.

Each Event bears a title, Period Event year (2.1), italicized flavor
text, and Event text. Flavor text provides historical interest and has
no effect on play.
When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally and in order (sometimes involving actions or decisions by
other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction
makes all selections involved in implementing the text, such as which
pieces are affected or which Faction will execute a free Operation
(5.5). If another Faction is specified or selected to take an action, that
Faction decides the details of the action. Some Events with lasting
effects have markers as aids to play. NOTE: RVN Leaders (2.4.1)
have text that follows the same general rules below as Event text.
Period Event (Set Up Option)
Card Number
Faction Order

Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text to carry
out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the Counterinsurgents, a player may select either text option regardless of Faction.

5.3 Capabilities

Dual-use Events marked “US CAPABILITIES”, “VC CAPABILITIES”, and so on
have lasting effects mainly relating to that
Faction. When executing such an Event,
place the corresponding marker on the appropriate side (unshaded
or shaded) in the Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the
rest of the game.
PLAY NOTE: Set out executed Capabilities Event cards near the
affected player(s) as added reminders.

5.4 Momentum

Title
Italicized Flavor Text
Event Text
Lasting Effects Indicator (5.3)
Shaded Text (see Dual Use 5.2)

NOTE: Light halos and gray rifles at some Faction symbols regard
Non-player instructions (8.4.1).

Event text (unshaded, shaded, or both) marked “MOMENTUM”
also includes lasting effects. When executing such text, place the
card in view near the draw pile. It has effects specified to last until
the next Coup round’s Reset phase (6.5), when the card is discarded.
NOTE: Any number of Momentum Events can be in play.
MARKERS: Place the “Medevac” marker on its
appropriate side onto the Event card while in
effect to record which use applies. Place the
“Peace Talks” marker on the “Linebacker II” Pivotal Event card if
unshaded Peace Talks executed and Linebacker II not.

Fire in the Lake

5.5 Free Operations

Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate
Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual sequence of
play and typically is free: it bears no Resource cost and does not affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other procedures and restrictions
remain unless modified by Event text (5.1.1). NOTE: Pacification,
Trail Improvement, and Agitation cost Resources even if part of free
Operations (3.2.1, 3.3.1). A free Ambush Special Activity occurs as
if an Attack is occuring in the space (4.4.3).
EXAMPLE: NVA free March (3.3.2) would cost 0 Resources and not
affect NVA Eligibility. Free Raid (4.3.3) would have to Activate an
Underground Ranger to remove enemies.

6.0 COUP ROUNDS

Conduct a Coup Round in the sequence of phases below
as each Coup Card is played, first following any immediate Coup effect (2.4) and adjusting Control (1.7). The
Sequence of Play sheet and board also list this sequence.

EXCEPTION: Never conduct more than 1 Coup Round in a row
(without at least 1 Event card in between)—instead, additional
Coup cards are played (including any new RVN Leader and any
immediate effect) without a Coup Round. If final (2.4.2), end the
game, determine victory (7.3).

6.1 Victory Phase

If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends (exceptions: Non-player option [1.5]; 1-player [8.9]). See Victory (7.0)
to determine winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue with the
Coup Round. After conducting the final Coup card’s Round (2.4.2),
determine victory per 7.3.

6.2 Resources Phase

Follow these steps to add to Factions’ Resources to a maximum of
75 (1.8).
6.2.1 Sabotage. Sabotage (3.3.4) each unSabotaged LoC where
Insurgent Guerrillas outnumber COIN pieces or adjacent to a City
without COIN Control (until no Sabotage markers remain, VC
chooses which spaces first).

6.3 Support Phase

US, ARVN, and VC may spend Resources to affect popular Support
and Opposition (1.6).
6.3.1 Pacification. The US and then ARVN may spend ARVN Resources to build Support in a combined total of up to 4 Provinces
and/or Cities. EXAMPLE: If the US Pacifies in 3 spaces, ARVN may
do so in only 1; if US in 4, ARVN in none; etc. Each space must have
COIN Control, Police, and the Pacifying Faction’s Troops. Every 3
ARVN Resources spent removes a Terror marker or—once no Terror
is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Support, to a
maximum of 2 levels per space total during each Support Phase (not
per Faction). The US may not spend Resources below marked Total
Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3). (See also Training, 3.2.1)
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police or local militias together provide
the security needed to gain popular support.
6.3.2 Agitation. VC may spend Resources to encourage Opposition
in up to 4 spaces with VC pieces and no COIN Control (1.7). Every
1 VC Resource they spend removes a Terror marker or—once no
Terror is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Opposition, to a maximum of 2 levels per space.

6.4 Redeploy Phase

Redeploy forces as follows without adjusting COIN or NVA Control
until afterwards.
6.4.1 Laos and Cambodia. Remove all US and ARVN pieces from
Laos and Cambodia—US Troops to the out of play box, all other
pieces to Available boxes.
DESIGN NOTE: The removal from Laos and Cambodia represents
the political cost of too lengthy an operation inside a neutral country.
6.4.2 ARVN Redeploy. The ARVN must move its Troops from
LoCs and Provinces without COIN Bases—and may move any
other ARVN Troops—to any Cities without NVA Control, any US
or ARVN Bases, or Saigon. ARVN then may move any Police to
any LoCs or to any COIN Controlled spaces within South Vietnam.
NOTE: US forces do not Redeploy.
6.4.3 NVA Redeploy. The NVA then may move NVA Troops (only)
from any map spaces to any NVA Bases (even COIN Controlled).

6.2.2 Degrade Trail. If any Laos or Cambodia space is COIN-Controlled, Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7).
6.2.3 ARVN Earnings. Add the Aid value to ARVN
Resources. Then add as well the Economic value (1.3.4)
of all LoCs that have no Sabotage (Total Econ, 15
minus the Econ value of any Sabotaged LoCs) and
adjust the “Econ” marker to show that unSabotaged Econ (affecting
US spending of ARVN Resources during the coming Campaign,
1.8.1).
6.2.4 Insurgent Earnings. Add to Resources:

•	 VC—The number of VC Bases on the map.
•	 NVA—The number of NVA Bases in Laos and Cambodia, plus
2 times the Trail value (6.7).
6.2.5 Casualties and Aid. Finally, subtract from Aid 3 times the
number of pieces in the Casualties box (3.3.3).

11

6.4.4 Control. Now adjust COIN and NVA
Control (1.7) to reflect the above moves.
6.4.5 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.2), end
and determine victory (7.3).

6.5 Commitment Phase

NOTE: This section alters that in the original edition.
ROTATION: If not the final Round, take 1 in 3 (round down) US
Troop and all Base Casualty pieces out of play. Return all US-led
Irregulars Casualty pieces to Available. Then the US places all other
US Troop Casualties into any COIN-Control spaces, LoCs, or Saigon. The US then may move US Troops totaling up to 10 minus the
number of Casualties just placed on the map, plus up to 2 US Bases,
among the US Available box, any COIN-Control spaces, LoCs, and
Saigon. Adjust any changes in Control and Victory markers (1.9) at
the end of the Phase.

WITHDRAWAL: For every 2 US pieces (rounded down) just
moved from map to Available, the VC may shift 1 Population by 1
level toward Opposition. No space may be shifted by more than 1
level. (Population shifted may otherwise be spread among spaces
as desired.)
NOTE: Commitment is the main time that the US “commits” forces
from Available to South Vietnam or “withdraws” them the other way.

6.6 Reset Phase

Then prepare for the next card as follows:
•	
•	
•	
•	

If the Trail (6.7) is at 0, Improve it to 1; if it is at 4, Degrade it to 3.
Remove all Terror and Sabotage markers (3.3.4).
Flip all Guerrillas and SF Underground (1.4.3).
Place any Momentum cards that were in effect onto the played
cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
•	 Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
•	 Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s
new top card (2.3.9).

6.7 The Trail

The (“Ho Chi Minh”) Trail track shows the efficiency
of land and water resupply from North to South Vietnam
as a value from 0 to 4—affecting NVA Rally (3.3.1),
March (3.3.2), Infiltration (4.4.1), and Earnings (6.2.4).
Improving the Trail raises the value; Degrading it decreases the value
(slide the Trail marker along the boxes). Rally (3.3.1), Air Strike
(4.2.3), US/ARVN incursions into Laos or Cambodia (6.2.2), Coup
Round Reset (6.6), and Events (5.0) all can affect the Trail value.

7.2 During Coup Rounds

Check victory at the start of each Coup Round (6.1), comparing
the positions of the various victory markers (1.9) to the thresholds
marked on the edge track. Victory conditions are:

•	 US: Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of Troops and Bases
in the US Available Forces box exceeds 50.
•	 NVA: Total NVA-Controlled Population plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map exceeds 18.
•	 ARVN: Total COIN-Controlled Population plus Patronage
exceeds 50.
•	 VC: Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus number of VC Bases on the
map exceeds 35.

7.3 After Final Coup

If the final Coup Round (2.4.2) is completed without a victory
check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory margin wins.
The victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or short of its
condition set forth in 7.2.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
•	
•	
•	
•	

US: Total Support + Available US – 50.
NVA: NVA-Controlled Population + NVA Bases – 18.
ARVN: COIN-Controlled Population + Patronage – 50.
VC: Total Opposition + VC Bases – 35.

DESIGN NOTE: Trail Degradation represents not only strikes on the
Ho Chi Minh Trail itself but also on sea transport and North Vietnam.

Victory Deception Option: For less knowledge of how close
Factions in 3- or 4-player games are to winning, each player
at start blindly draws 2 Deception markers. Set aside the rest;
they may not be inspected. Players may reveal their Deception
markers only as they use them:

7.0 VICTORY

Hidden Agenda: Permanently add +1 to the holding player’s
victory margin (7.3).

Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Faction aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2), all
players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player does so or
if none does by game end, the Faction that reached the highest
victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd highest comes in 2nd
place, and so on. Ties go to Non-players (8.0), then the VC, then
the ARVN, then the NVA.

Empty Threat: No effect (reveal at game end).

Hidden Asset: Convert any 1 LimOp option (2.3.5) into a full
Op & Special Activity option.
Handicap Option: If players possess a mix of experience levels, use the above option, but allow the inexperienced players
to secretly select any 2 markers each, least experienced first;
the experienced players then blindly draw 2 markers each from
those remaining.

STOP!

You have read all rules needed for 4 players or
the No Non-Player option with 2 or 3 players
(1.5, recommended for first-time play).

8.0 NON-PLAYER FACTIONS

This section governs actions by any Factions beyond those represented by a player, for solitaire or as an alternative to the No Non-Player
option for 2 or 3 players (1.5). See also the Playbook’s Non-Player
Examples of Play.
NOTE: Non-player Factions may not act only in their own direct
interest. Like players, they sometimes help, sometimes harm, one
another.
Important: If playing solitaire, be sure to read the special 1-player
victory conditions (8.9) before you start!

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

The Sequence of Play aid sheet summarizes the following rules in
gray text.

•	 Pivotal Events. If any player Faction is 1st Eligible, all Eligible
Non-players immediately execute their playable Pivotal Events
(8.4.6) instead of following their normal Non-player instructions.
•	 When a Non-player has a choice between Event, Operation or
Pass, its flowchart and the corresponding instructions in sections
8.5-8.8 will show which it selects.
•	 Operations Not Limited. Non-Players must follow all rules as if
players, except for the following: Whenever a Non-player Faction
by the Sequence of Play (2.3.4) is to execute a Limited Operation
(2.3.5), it instead executes a full Operation and Special Activity.
(Non-players execute free LimOps by Event normally, [5.5] as
LimOps.)
•	 Ineffective Events. Non-player Factions opt only for Events that
would have an effect (something happens, including Capabilities, 5.3) and for Momentum Events (5.4) when the next card is
“Coup!” only if they would have an immediate or Coup Round
effect (EXAMPLES: “Bombing Pause”, “Blowtorch Komer”,
“Medevac”, “Oriskany”, “Rolling Thunder” all have such effects; “Claymores”, “Wild Weasels” do not).
INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: Non-player US is 1st Eligible
for “Operation Attleboro”. At the moment, no Tunnel is on the map.
The Event would have no effect, so the US executes Operations and
a Special Activity instead.
8.1.1 Events, Operations, and Special Activities. To execute an
Event with a Non-player, follow the section below about Non-player
Events and any individual Event instructions on the reverse of the
Random Spaces foldout (8.4.1). To execute a Non-player Faction’s
Operations and Special Activities, see the Non-Player flowcharts and
the rules section below governing that Faction’s actions.
GUIDELINES: Unless otherwise specified, carry out whatever
actions apply to the maximum extent (such as in the most spaces
or with the most pieces allowed and only as long as needed pieces
and Resources are available). Normal Resource costs, requirements,
and procedures apply.
EXAMPLE: Non-Player VC Terror Activates an Underground Guerrilla and costs 1 Resource per City or Province, per 3.3.4.
PLAY NOTE: To more easily implement Ops that move pieces
(March, Patrol, Sweep, Transport, Raid, Air Lift, 8.5-8.8), first
identify which pieces can move, then their destinations.
8.1.2 Pieces and Resources. The Random Spaces sheet summarizes
the following. Unless otherwise specified, once spaces involved are
selected, Non-player Factions:

13

•	 As possible, place friendly and target or remove enemy Bases,
then Guerrillas or Special Forces, then alternating Troops and
Police evenly but keeping the last Police until last, beginning
with whichever is fewest in the space (Troops if even). Within
that, target enemy Underground before Active Guerrillas or SF,
then enemy US before ARVN and enemy VC before NVA.
•	 Remove friendly pieces in the reverse order from the above, to the
degree possible, alternating Troops and Police evenly, beginning
with whichever is most in the space (Troops if even), Active before
Underground Guerrillas or SF.
•	 Never place 2 COIN (US or ARVN) Bases in the same space, nor
ARVN Bases into Cities.
•	 Move friendly (US and ARVN) from out-of-play first, then from
Casualties, then from Available. Move out-of-play or Casualty
pieces to Available or the map in this order: Bases, then Rangers,
Troops, Irregulars. Move friendly pieces to out-of-play or
Casualties in the reverse order from the above.
•	 Remove pieces to be replaced even if no pieces are available to
replace them (1.4.1, EXCEPTION: Infiltrate, 4.4.1).
•	 Never voluntarily transfer Resources (1.5.2).
8.1.3 Selecting Spaces. When executing Operations and Special
Activities by the priorities on the Non-Player flowcharts (and per 8.4
to 8.8), select spaces for each listed priority in order until there are
no more legal candidate spaces or actions for that priority, or until
any space limit within that priority is reached. Then move on to the
next priority and do the same, until any overall space limit for the
Operation or Special Activity is reached, or until the Faction runs
out of Resources (if applicable). Sometimes, priorities will provide
a precedence of what spaces or situations should be selected first; if
not, select equal candidates randomly as described below (8.2-8.3).
8.1.4 Reading the Flowcharts. The Second Edition Non-Player
flowcharts show priorities with circled numbers (e.g., ❶,❷,①,②)
and colored letters (e.g., a , b ) to indicate their order and nature:

•	 Numbered priorities (e.g., ❶,①) are sequential priorities. Execute
the instructions in each sequential priority to the maximum extent
before moving to the next sequential priority. Some top-level
sequential priorities (black circles; e.g., ❶,❷) contain further
sequential priorities (white circles; e.g., ①,②) that are parts of
and sequential steps to that top-level priority.
•	 Lettered priorities (e.g., a , b ) are nested priorities. Nested
priorities act as tie breakers within the sequential priorities to
which they are ordained. Each nested priority further narrows the
thus-far selected set of spaces or targets. For readability, nested
priorities have a shaded background.

8.2 Random Spaces

If several candidate Provinces or Cities have equal priority for a
Non-player Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select one using
the Random Spaces Map:

•	 Roll two dice in succession: the first die thrown indicates the
“tens”, the second die the “ones” (Example: “2” followed by “6”
is 26, Quang Tri).
•	 If the resulting space is not a candidate, follow the arrows on the
Random Spaces Map until one is reached.
•	 Carry out as much of the action as possible in the candidate space
reached, then roll again to select another space only if needed.
PLAY NOTE: If players agree, choose among a few spaces by equalchance die roll instead.

Fire in the Lake

14

8.3 Random LoCs

If both LoCs and other spaces are equal candidates, choose LoCs
last. If several LoCs are candidates, choose:
•	 First that with the highest Econ.
•	 Then that adjacent to a Random City (8.2).
•	 Then with an equal chance die roll.
Sabotage only unSabotaged LoCs.

8.4 Non-Player Events

NOTE: Events will not always benefit the executing Non-player
Faction directly.

8.4.1 Event Instructions. Whenever any Non-player Faction is to
execute an Event and that Faction’s symbol on the card has a gray
rifle below it, the Non-player declines the Event and instead executes
Operations and Special Ability. If the symbol has a light-colored
halo, instead first check any special instructions for that Event on
the reverse of the Random Spaces sheet. When a Faction plays an
Event that gives free Operations or Special Activities (5.5) to another,
Non-player Faction, the 2nd Faction’s Event instructions (if any)
apply to how it executes those free actions.
Halo: Special Instructions

Rifle: Do not play Event

8.4.2 Dual-Use Events. Non-player NVA and VC executing a Dual-Use Event (5.2) use the shaded text, while Non-player US and
ARVN use unshaded text, unless Event Instructions say otherwise
(8.4.1).
8.4.3 Event Placement. Place, remove, or relocate as many pieces
(per 8.1.2) as Events, availability (1.4.1), and stacking (1.4.2) allow.
When allowed and unless otherwise specified, Non-player US and
ARVN place or move friendly pieces from out of play first, then
from Casualties, then from Available.
8.4.4 Events—Who, What, and Where. Unless otherwise specified:

•	 When there is a choice of who gets Event benefits (such as
Resources, free Operations, or placing pieces or Tunnel markers),
select the executing Faction, then the other friendly Faction, then
a random enemy, Non-player first. US and ARVN always increase
rather than decrease Aid and ARVN Resources, NVA and VC the
reverse. ARVN increases rather than decreases Patronage, all other
Factions the reverse.
•	 For any choices as part of free Operations (including Limited
Operations) or Special Activities, use that Faction’s priorities (8.58.8). but ignore any instructions about playing Events or Passing.
For multiple free Operations (such as “Sweep then Assault”), use
the priorities for the first. Where not applicable, choose pieces per
8.1.2 and spaces randomly (8.2-8.3). NOTE: If there is a choice
among Operations, use the Faction’s flowchart to select one. If
there is a choice among Special Activities without an Operation,
follow the flowcharts to see which Operation and Special Activity
is selected but ignore the Operation as well.
•	 Select spaces for shifts in Support or Opposition per 8.4.5 below.
•	 Within the above (if applicable), select Event spaces to ensure that
as many Bases then other pieces as possible are placed, removed,

or replaced. When removing enemy pieces, use the priorities in
8.1.2 above. If friendly pieces are to be removed and there is a
choice, remove the other Faction’s pieces.
•	 Otherwise, select spaces randomly (8.2.3).
PLACEMENT EXAMPLE: Non-player VC executing “Cu Chi”
place as many Tunnel markers as possible, VC Tunnels first. So they
select first a Province with 2 un-Tunneled VC Bases, if any such
space, then a space with 1 VC and 1 NVA un-Tunneled Base each,
then a space with just 1 un-Tunneled VC Base.
OP EXAMPLE: Non-player US is executing “SEALORDS”. Decide
by each Faction’s priorities whether it will either Sweep or Assault.
The US Assaults if doing so could remove NVA Control, a Base, or a
Tunnel, or could remove at least 6 enemies (8.8.2), otherwise Sweeps.
8.4.5 Events that Shift Support/Opposition. Unless otherwise
specified, Non-player Factions select spaces for Event effects that
shift Support or Opposition as follows:
•	 VC for the highest gain in Total Opposition, then the highest loss
in Total Support.
•	 NVA for the highest loss in Total Support, then the least gain in
Total Opposition.
•	 ARVN for the highest loss in Total Opposition, then the least gain
in Total Support.
•	 US for the highest gain in Total Support, then the highest loss in
Total Opposition.

8.4.6 Pivotal Events. A Non-player Faction holding a Pivotal Event
plays it the instant that it is playable (that Faction is Eligible, the
Event’s preconditions are met, and no Coup is next, 2.3.8 & 5.1.4)
and that any player Faction is 1st Eligible (including because the
player just played a Pivotal Event that the Non-Player’s Event can
trump). If 2 or 3 Non-Players play Pivotal Events at once, they trump
one another normally.
EXAMPLE: A US player is 1st Eligible on the played Event. No
Coup is showing. Non-player VC are also Eligible, have not yet
played “Tet Offensive”, and have more than 20 Guerrillas in South
Vietnam. The VC immediately execute “Tet Offensive”.
NOTE: When a Non-player plays a Pivotal Event, further instructions (8.4.1) guide its execution.
8.4.7 Other Event Choices. When a Non-player Faction while executing an Event has a choice that is not otherwise covered above,
choose randomly among the possibilities. EXAMPLE: Non-player
execution of “RAND” chooses a candidate US Capability to flip
with an equal chance die roll.

8.5 Non-Player VC Actions

This subsection governs actions by the VC Faction as a
Non-player, as shown on the “Non-player VC” flowchart
sheet. When the VC are Eligible by the Sequence of Play (2.3) to
take an action (and not executing their Pivotal Event, 8.4.6), consult
their flowchart—beginning at the upper left—and, as needed, the
rules below. When executing free Operations and/or Special Activities granted by Events (5.5), consult individual flowchart boxes and
rules sections below as appropriate (8.4).
NOTE: It is not necessary to read through the lengthy stipulations below before playing because they are summarized on the
Non-player flowcharts. Refer to these rules as needed to clarify the
flowcharts’ shorthand.

Fire in the Lake
8.5.1 Terror. When the VC are to take an action, they will execute
a Terror Operation (3.3.4) if either of these conditions are met:
•	 They have enough Resources (without Taxing) and Underground
Guerrillas to execute Terror in any space with Active or Passive,
OR
•	 They have enough Resources (without Taxing) and Underground
Guerrillas to shift Population equal to or exceeding a roll of two
six-sided dice towards Active Opposition.
If the VC execute a Terror Operation, they do so as follows:

•	 If the VC hit 0 Resources while executing Terror and it is possible
for them to Tax per below, they do so before continuing Terror.
•	 Execute Terror everywhere that a shift is possible (not at 0
Population nor Active Opposition) without Activating the last
Underground VC Guerrilla in any Neutral or Passive Opposition
space with any VC Base, first in the spaces with the highest
Population, then randomly. NOTE: In Support spaces the VC
cannot Rally, so there they will use their last Underground
Guerrilla for Terror if necessary hoping to bring the space to
Neutral.
•	 Then, if and only if the VC have more than 12 Resources and Aid
is less than 30, on all unsabotaged LoCs (with Underground VC).
TAX: If the VC already Taxed once, their Op and Special Activity
is complete. If not, they do so now, unless they already have a lot of
Resources and—unless they are at 0 Resources—only where it does
not hurt Opposition or add Support. Tax up to 4 spaces (that have
Underground VC Guerrillas and no COIN Control, 4.5.1) if and only
if the VC have no more than 9 Resources, as follows:
•	 First Tax the 2-Econ and then any 1-Econ LoCs possible.
•	 Then Tax spaces at Active Support where possible (Underground
VC and no COIN Control), highest Population spaces first.
•	 Finally, if and only if the VC at this moment remain with 0 Resources, Tax up to 4 Active Opposition then other random spaces,
highest Population first in each case (not at 0 Pop).
If the VC already have more than 9 Resourses or no such VC Taxation is possible, the VC instead Subvert as follows:
SUBVERT: If the VC Terrorized, Rallied, or Marched but did not
Tax or Ambush, they Subvert in 1 or 2 spaces (with Underground
VC Guerrillas and ARVN cubes, 4.5.2) as follows:

•	 First, where possible to remove COIN Control, from the most
Population possible.
•	 Then, within the above priority, to remove the most cubes, Troops
and Police evenly (starting with the fewest in the space, Troops
if even, 8.1.2).
•	 In each space, replace ARVN with VC only where only 1 ARVN
cube is in the space.
If no such Subversion is possible, the VC execute no Special Activity
with their Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).
8.5.2 Event or Operations? If the Conditions for VC Terror are
not met, the VC check if they will play the current Event or Pass,
as follows:

•	 If the next card is a VC Capability but the current card is not (or
the current Event is a Capability that has already been played by
the 1st Eligible Faction), and a d6 roll now exceeds the number
of Coup cards in the RVN Leader box (2.4.1), the VC will Pass
(2.3.3), gaining 1 Resource. On the next card, if the VC do not

15

execute Terror (8.5.1) they will play the Event without having to
roll again.
•	 Otherwise, if the current card is any Faction’s Capability (and has
not already been played), play the Event if a d6 roll either now
or on the previous card (as above) exceeds the number of Coup
Cards in the RVN Leader box.
•	 If neither the next nor the current card is a Capability, play the
Event if possible unless it is Ineffective (8.1), following any VC
Event Instructions (8.4.1) for this Event.
8.5.3 Rally. If the conditions for VC Terror are not met and the VC
did not play the Event or Pass, the VC will Rally if either of these
conditions are met:
•	 Rally per the below instructions would place at least 2 VC Bases,
OR
•	 A roll now of three six-sided dice scores less than the number of
VC Guerrillas Available.
•	 The VC have tried to Attack (8.5.5) but were unable to do so.

If the VC Rally, they do so in up to 6 spaces (without Support,
3.3.1), as follows:

•	 If the VC hit 0 Resources while Rallying and it is possible for them
to Tax per 8.5.1 above, they do so before continuing to Rally.
•	 Place a VC Base (replacing 2 Guerrillas, 3.3.1, removing Active
Guerrillas first, 8.1.2) wherever there are at least 4 VC Guerrillas
(and room for the Base, 1.4.2).
•	 Then place single Guerrillas in up to 2 spaces that have no VC
Guerrillas yet. Within that, first select spaces where there are
ARVN cubes, then spaces with Population 1 or higher.
•	 Next, place VC Guerrillas wherever there already is a VC Base
and fewer than 4 Underground (not Active) VC Guerrillas.
•	 Then place single VC Guerrillas in other spaces that have 1, 2, or
3 VC Guerrillas.
•	 Finally Rally in other random spaces inside South Vietnam (until
a total of 6 Rally spaces is reached or the VC have no more
Resources).
•	 If any of the above bullets have more candidate spaces than can
be selected, within that bullet first select those candidate spaces
where the Rally would remove any COIN Control (1.7), then – if
and only if the NVA are a player (not if there is a Non- player
NVA) – in spaces with Population 1 or more where the Rally
would remove NVA Control.
If the shaded “Cadres” Capability is in effect (5.3), Agitate now as
possible per “Cadres” and per the priorities in 8.5.6 below.
IF NONE: If no Rally is possible, such as because no Taxation
occurred and the VC have 0 Resources, instead March per 8.5.4
below or, if that is not possible, Attack per 8.5.5 below, or if that is
not possible either, Pass.
TAX: If the VC Taxed per above, their Op and Special Activity are
complete. If they did not Tax, but can do so now, they Tax per 8.5.1.
SUBVERT: If the VC Rallied but did not and do not now Tax, they
Subvert per 8.5.1 above.
8.5.4 March. If the VC neither Terrorized, played the Event, Passed,
or Rallied, and it is not Monsoon (2.3.9), March as follows (and
per 8.1.2):
•	 For the moves below, always leave 2 VC Guerrillas per space

Fire in the Lake

with a VC Base and 1 VC Guerrilla per other City or Province in
South Vietnam— leaving behind Underground Guerrillas first if
other priorities can be met.
Also, do not move out of any South Vietnam space so as to add
either COIN Control or NVA Control to it (1.7).
First, March to get 1 Underground VC Guerrilla onto each of up to
three 1-Econ or 2-Econ LoC spaces possible (paying 0 Resources,
3.3.2).
Then, if VC have 1+ Resources, March into spaces that have at
least 1 Population. Within that priority March first to get the largest
possible number of Underground Guerrillas into spaces that are
not yet at Active Opposition; within that priority first wherever
there is room for at least one Base; and within that priority March
to remove COIN Control from the most Population possible. If
there are still multiple candidate spaces to choose between, select
randomly (8.2).
Finally—if and only if the NVA are a player—March into spaces
in South Vietnam with NVA Control where it is possible for the
arrival of Marching VC to remove that Control. Within that priority, March first to spaces with VC Bases.

•	 First, Ambush in up to 2 spaces as described above (8.5.4
AMBUSH).
•	 Then Attack in spaces with enemy pieces and at least 3 Active
but no Underground VC Guerrillas. Within that they select Attack
spaces and targets in the same way as for Ambushes (8.5.4), except
that non-Ambush Attacks can only remove pieces in the Attack
space itself: first where a successful Attack would remove at least
one COIN Base, then to remove Special Forces, then to remove
Troops and Police.
•	 Remove pieces within a selected space using the above (8.1.2)
priorities: Bases whenever possible, Special Forces, then Troops
and Police evenly (whichever least), and US before ARVN within
each of these categories. NOTE: Bases would only be removed
once no other COIN pieces are left (3.3.3).
IF NONE: If no such Attack is possible, instead March (8.5.4), or if
that is not possible, Rally (8.5.3), or if that is not possible either, Pass.
TAX: If no Ambush was executed as part of the Attack, the VC
instead Tax per 8.5.3. If that is not possible either, they execute no
Special Activity with their Attack (Op Only, 2.3.4).

IF NONE: If no such March is possible (such as during Monsoon,
2.3.9), the VC instead Attack (8.5.5), or if that is not possible, Rally
(8.5.3), or if that is not possible either, Pass (2.3.3). EXAMPLE:
The VC are to March but have 0 Resources and cannot get any
Underground Guerrillas onto LoCs; they try to Attack, but have 0
Resources so the Attack instruction refers them to Rally, where they
begin with Tax to get Resources.

8.5.6 Agitate. The Non-player VC Agitate (6.3.2) to the maximum
extent that they can, first for the greatest total shift, within that priority first where there is any Support, and within that priority first
where there is no Terror marker. If there are still multiple candidate
spaces, select randomly (8.2). Remove Terror markers only if a
shift would be achieved (because the VC will have Resources after
removing the Terror and the space is not yet at Active Opposition).

AMBUSH: After Marching or during an Attack Operation, Ambush
in up to 2 spaces with Underground VC Guerrillas (if after a March
Operation, Guerrillas that just Marched (4.5.3)), or in 1 such space
if unshaded “Booby Traps” is in effect (5.3).

8.6 Non-Player NVA Actions

•	 If shaded “Main Force Bns” is in effect, use it in the first space
where it could remove an extra enemy piece.
•	 Within each of the bullets below, Ambush from LoCs into an
adjacent space whenever possible (4.4.3 ROAD/RIVER), and
within that priority select Ambush spaces to remove US pieces
before ARVN ones.
•	 First select up to Ambush space where the Ambush can remove
enough COIN units from a space with a COIN Base to allow
another Ambush space or Attack this Operation to remove that
Base.
•	 Then Ambush to remove COIN Bases wherever possible.
•	 Then Ambush to remove Special Forces (Irregulars or Rangers).
•	 Finally Ambush to remove Troops or Police. If removing 2+ pieces
from the same space, remove Troops and Police evenly, beginning
with the type that has fewest cubes in the space (Troops if even).
TAX OR SUBVERT: If no such Ambush is possible, Tax or, if the
Operation was a March and Tax is not possible, Subvert, all per 8.5.1.
If no such Special Activity is possible, the VC execute no Special
Activity with their Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).
8.5.5 Attack. If the VC neither Terrorized, played the Event, Passed,
Rallied or Marched, and they have at least 1 Resource, they Attack
(3.3.3). The VC will Attack to Ambush and wherever they have
large groups of Guerrillas, until they run out of targets or Resources.
Select spaces for Attacks and Ambushes, and remove enemy pieces
within those spaces, as follows:
•	 If the VC have 0 Resources, they Rally instead (8.5.3).

This subsection governs actions by the NVA Faction as a
Non-player, as shown on the “Non-player NVA” flowchart
sheet. When the NVA are Eligible by the Sequence of Play (2.3) to
take an action (and not executing their Pivotal Event, 8.4.6), consult
their flowchart—beginning at the upper left—and, as needed, the
rules below. When executing free Operations and/or Special Activities granted by Events (5.5), consult individual flowchart boxes and
rules sections below as appropriate (8.4).
8.6.1 Attack. When the NVA are to take an action, they Attack if
any combination of Ambushes and/or Troop Attacks (but not counting non-Ambush Guerrilla Attacks or Bombard Special Activities)
can remove a COIN Base or a number of enemy pieces equal or
exceeding the roll now of a six-sided die. NOTE: If the NVA have
0 Resources, they cannot Attack to remove any enemy pieces and
thus automatically continue to 8.6.2 “Pass, Event or Operations?”.
First the NVA execute a Special Activity as follows:

AMBUSH: If the NVA have 4 or more Resources and an Ambush
could only remove 1 enemy piece, they instead Bombard per below.
Otherwise they Ambush in up to 2 spaces with fewer than 4 NVA
Troops as follows:
•	 First Ambush to remove COIN Bases, or where the Ambush would
allow another Ambush space or Troop Attack this Operation to
remove COIN Bases. Within this priority, Ambush first from
LoCs if possible (4.4.3 ROAD/RIVER). NOTE: The “fewer than
4 NVA Troops” condition applies to the Ambush space, i.e., the
space where the Guerrilla is located, regardless of what space
the enemy piece is removed from!
•	 Then Ambush other COIN pieces, first in Laos and/or Cambodia,

if possible; within that Ambush first to remove the last COIN

piece in a space; within that Ambush Special Forces (Irregulars or
Rangers) before cubes, and within all of these Ambush to remove
US pieces before ARVN ones.
•	 If no such Ambush is possible, instead Bombard as follows:
BOMBARD: Bombard 2 spaces (in or adjacent to 1 or more spaces
with at least 3 NVA Troops, and with either at least 3 COIN Troops
or a COIN Base and at least 1 COIN Troop, 4.4.2)—or, if the
“Long Range Guns” Capability is in effect, Bombard 1 or 3 spaces
as allowed:
•	 First in spaces with NVA pieces
•	 Then in spaces adjacent to NVA Troops.
•	 Within both of the above priorities, first select spaces with a
COIN Base; within that priority, select spaces with and Bombard
to remove US Troops before ARVN ones.
If no such Bombardment is possible, the NVA execute no Special
Activity with their Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).
ATTACK: After resolving any Special Activity, the NVA then select
Attack spaces and whether to use NVA Troops or NVA Guerrillas
as follows:
•	 First Attack wherever NVA Troops can remove 2+ enemy pieces.
•	 Next Attack with groups of 4+ NVA Guerrillas (in any combination
of Active and/or Underground).
•	 Finally Attack where NVA Troops can remove 1 enemy piece
(accounting for any effect of the “PT-76” Capability, 5.3).
Within each of the above Attack bullets, apply the following tiebreaks:

•	 First target any enemy pieces in Laos or Cambodia, then those
within South Vietnam.
•	 Within that priority, Attack first where a Base can be removed,
then where Special Forces (Irregulars or Rangers) can be removed,
finally Troops and Police evenly (starting with the fewest in the
space, 8.1.2). For each Attack space, remove enemy pieces in that
order, to the degree allowed.
•	 Within those priorities, select target spaces with and Attack to
remove US pieces before ARVN whenever possible.
•	 If the shaded “PT-76” Capability is in effect, use it in the Attack
space where it will remove most extra enemy pieces.
8.6.2 Pass, Event or Operations? If the Conditions for NVA Terror
are not met, the NVA check if they will play the current Event or
Pass, as follows:

•	 If the next card is an NVA Capability but the current card is not
(or the current Event is a Capability that has already been played
by the 1st Eligible Faction), and a d6 roll now exceeds the number
of Coup cards in the RVN Leader box (2.4.1), the NVA will Pass
(2.3.3), gaining 1 Resource. On the next card, if the NVA do not
Attack (8.6.1) they will play the Event without having to roll
again.
•	 Otherwise, if the current card is any Faction’s Capability, play the
Event if a d6 roll either now or on the previous card (as above)
exceeds the number of Coup Cards in the RVN Leader box.
•	 If neither the next nor the current card is a Capability, play the
Event if possible unless it is Ineffective (8.1), following any NVA
Event Instructions (8.4.1) for this Event.
•	 If the NVA did not play the Event and have 0 Resources, they
Pass (2.3.3) gaining 1 Resource.

17

8.6.3 Terror. If the NVA did not Attack, play the Event or Pass, and if
they could execute Terror (3.3.4) with either NVA Troops or Underground NVA Guerrillas in spaces at Active or Passive Support with a
total Population equal to or exceeding the roll now of one six-sided
die, they do so in each such space. If NVA Resources are too few to
Terrorize all such spaces, select those with highest Population first.
BOMBARD: Then Bombard per 8.6.1.
8.6.4 Rally. If the NVA did not Attack, play the Event, Pass or
Terrorize, they Rally if any of the following conditions are met:
•	 The Trail is 0 or 1.
•	 At least one space with one or more NVA Bases has fewer than
2 NVA units.
•	 A roll of two six-sided dice now exceeds the number of NVA
Guerrillas Available.
•	 Rally per the instructions below would place at least one NVA
Base.
•	 The NVA attempted to March but were unable to do so.
If the NVA Rally, they do so in up to 3 spaces (without Support,
3.3.1) and improve the Trail. EXCEPTION: If the unshaded “AAA”
Capability is in effect and the Trail would be improved per below,
they instead Rally in only 1 space and improve the Trail.
Select spaces and Rally as follows:

•	 Place an NVA Base (replacing 2 NVA Guerrillas, 3.3.1, removing
Active Guerrillas first, 8.1.2) wherever there are at least 4 NVA or
VC Guerrillas or Troops (including 2 NVA Guerrillas and room
for the Base, 1.4.2).
•	 Then place NVA Guerrillas at any COIN Control in Laos or
Cambodia.
•	 Next place Guerrillas at NVA Bases where there are no or only
1 NVA units, then at any other NVA Bases (with 2 or more NVA
units already).
•	 Finally, place Guerrillas in other random spaces, until the specified
number of Rally spaces is reached (or Resources run out).
After placing any pieces, pay to Improve the Trail, if possible, unless
the NVA already have fewer than 3 Resources, or unless the Trail
is already at 3 and NVA have fewer than 9 Resources. EXAMPLE:
NVA with 3+ Resources, Trail at 2, and shaded “SA-2s” improve
the Trail to 4.
IF NONE: If no such Rally is possible, instead March per 8.6.5
below or, if that is not possible either, Pass.
INFILTRATE: After Rallying (or Marching), Infiltrate in up to 2
spaces (or in 1 space if the unshaded “559th Transport Grp” Momentum Event is in effect) if and only if an NVA Base or at least 4
Troops would be placed, as follows:
•	 First replace VC Bases in spaces with more NVA than VC pieces
but no NVA Base already (shifting Opposition, 4.4.1)—first
Tunnelled Bases, within that priority first in spaces with the
highest Population, finally in random spaces. If there are no NVA
Bases Available, they may first remove one Base from the space
in North Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia with the most NVA pieces
to Availale in order to replace one VC Base. NOTE: This is the
only time a Non-player voluntarily removes one of its own pieces
to Available (1.4.1) without being required to do so by an Event
effect.

Fire in the Lake

•	 Then place Troops (at NVA Bases), first in those Base spaces with
the most NVA Guerrillas, within that priority first in spaces with
2 NVA Bases, and within those priorities first in or adjacent to
Cities or Provinces with no NVA Control.
•	 If placing Troops, then also replace NVA Guerrillas in those spaces
with Troops, but only where there are more than 2 NVA Guerrillas
in a space and until 2 are left.
BOMBARD: If Infiltrate would place neither an NVA Base nor at
least 4 Troops, or if Infiltration is possible (EXAMPLE: “McNamara
Line”), instead Bombard per 8.6.1.
8.6.5 March. If no conditions for any other Operation applied, the
NVA did not play the Event or Pass, and it is not Monsoon (2.3.9),
the NVA will March—first to set up for placing a Base in Laos/
Cambodia, then to get a few Guerrillas on LoCs, then with larger
groups to expand NVA Control. NVA March as follows:
•	 While executing the bullets below, the NVA will leave behind a
minimum of 2 NVA units in each space with one or more NVA
Bases, and enough NVA units to keep NVA Control in all spaces
that had NVA Control at the beginning of the Operation. They will
leave Guerrillas behind to the greatest extent possible while still
meeting the requirements of the bullet currently being executed.
•	 Use the Trail to move pieces more than one space only if the Trail
is at 4 (3.3.2, 6.7) or if the March is free (5.5). Do not leave NVA
pieces in transit spaces that lacked NVA Control at the beginning
of the Operation.
•	 First, if any NVA Base is in the Available Forces box, March so
that at least one space in Laos or Cambodia with room for a Base
(1.4.2) has at least 4 NVA units including at least 2 NVA Guerrillas.
•	 Then March 1 Underground NVA Guerrilla from a City or
Province onto 1 LoC that does not already have an Underground
NVA or VC Guerrilla, the Highway from Hue to Da Nang if
possible, otherwise 1 random LoC.
•	 Then March to add NVA Control. While executing this priority, all
units Marching from the same space stay together and do not split
up. March to add NVA Control to the up to 3 highest Population
spaces possible, within that priority first to where only 1 Marching
group is needed, within that priority first to where there is no US
Base, and within those priorities first where there is a VC Base
but no NVA Base.
•	 Finally, March to get the greatest possible number of NVA Troops
that are not already adjacent to a space with COIN Control into
1 space that is adjacent to a space with COIN Control in South
Vietnam.
IF NONE: If no such March is possible (EXAMPLE: Monsoon,
2.3.9), instead Rally (8.6.4) or, if that is not possible either, Pass.
AMBUSH: After Marching, if and only if Ambushing would remove
a US or ARVN Base, including by combining 2 Ambush spaces if
necessary, do so (in up to 2 spaces with Underground NVA Guerrillas that Marched, 4.4.3). If after removing a COIN Base there is
still one Ambush space left to use, Ambush US Troops if possible,
otherwise COIN cubes on any LoC. Within those priorities, Ambush
from LoCs if possible (4.4.3 ROAD/RIVER).
INFILTRATE OR BOMBARD: If Ambush after March cannot
remove a Base, instead Infiltrate per 8.6.4 above or, if that is not
possible, Bombard per 8.6.1.
8.6.6 Redeploy. In the Redeploy Phase (6.4.3), relocate NVA Troops
as follows:

•	 Never move Troops out of a space so as to lose NVA Control or
add COIN Control. Unless this is the final Coup Round of the
game, keep the last 2 NVA units (Guerrillas if possible) in each
space with NVA Bases.
•	 Unless this is the final Coup Round, first relocate so each space
with NVA Bases has at least 2 NVA units.
•	 Next relocate to add as much total NVA Control on the map as
possible, moving in only the Troops needed to add Control.
•	 Then relocate to at least remove COIN Control where it is not
possible to also add NVA Control.
•	 Finally, relocate into 1 space, first in South Vietnam, to get the
most additional NVA Troops adjacent to COIN Control that were
not already so adjacent.

8.7 Non-Player ARVN Actions

This subsection governs actions by the ARVN Faction as a Non-player, as shown on the “Non-player ARVN” flowchart sheet. When the
ARVN are Eligible by the Sequence of Play (2.3) to take an action
(and not executing their Pivotal Event, 8.4.6), consult their flowchart—beginning at the upper left—and, as needed, the rules below.
When executing free Operations and/or Special Activities granted by
Events (5.5), consult individual flowchart boxes and rules sections
below as appropriate (8.4).
8.7.1 Pass, Event or Operation? If ARVN are to take an action,
they first check if they will play the current Event or Pass, as follows:

•	 If the next card is an ARVN Capability but the current card is not
(or the current Event is a Capability that has already been played
by the 1st Eligible Faction), and a d6 roll now exceeds the number
of Coup cards in the RVN Leader box (2.4.1), the ARVN will Pass
(2.3.3), gaining 3 Resources. On the next card, the ARVN will
play the Event without having to roll again.
•	 Otherwise, if the current card is any Faction’s Capability and has
not already been played, play the Event if a d6 roll either now
or on the previous card (as above) exceeds the number of Coup
Cards in the RVN Leader box.
•	 If neither the next nor the current card is a Capability, play the
Event if possible unless it is Ineffective (8.1), following any ARVN
Event Instructions (8.4.1) for this Event.
•	 If the ARVN did not play the Event and have less than 3 Resources,
they Pass (2.3.3) gaining 3 Resources.
8.7.2 Train. If the ARVN did not play the Event or Pass, they will
Train (3.2.1) if at least one of the following conditions is met:
•	 There are at least 12 ARVN pieces in the Available box.
•	 Train alone (i.e., without any Transport) would place an ARVN
Base.
•	 The ARVN attempted to Patrol but were unable to do so.

If the ARVN Train, they do so to place pieces in up to 3 spaces
(where no NVA Control, 3.2.1) plus if necessary in one additional
space to Pacify, as follows:

•	 First, in up to 3 spaces, place exactly 6 cubes—or up to 2
Rangers once fewer than 6 ARVN cubes are Available—each into
Provinces with either US or ARVN Bases or into Cities. If placing
cubes, place Troops and Police as evenly as possible, beginning
with the type of which there are fewest in the space already, or
if tied with Troops (8.1.2). Select spaces to add COIN Control if
possible, within that priority first to add either Police or ARVN
Troops where there are none of that type yet.

Fire in the Lake
•	 Then pause Training to Govern or, if not possible, Transport per
below, before resuming Training.
•	 After Governing or Transporting (if any was possible), and if no
more than 2 Train spaces were selected above, Train to replace 3
ARVN cubes with an ARVN Base in 1 Province in South Vietnam
where no Govern occurred and where there are at least 5 total US
and ARVN units including at least 3 ARVN cubes, and no US nor
ARVN Base already. Remove Troops and Police as evenly as
possible, beginning with the type of which there are most in the
space (Troops first if tied, 8.1.2).
•	 If no ARVN Base was placed, Pacify in 1 Training space per 8.7.6
below. If it is not possible to Pacify in any of the up to 3 spaces
selected so far, Train for 0 Resources (placing no pieces) in one
additional space where where no Govern occurred and where it
would be possible to Pacify per 8.7.6. Within these priorities,
Pacify in a space with any NVA or VC Base, if possible.
IF NONE: If no such Training is possible but ARVN Governed or
Transported, ARVN Train for 0 Resources (placing no pieces). If
neither such Training nor Govern nor Transport was possible, ARVN
Pass (receiving 3 Resources, 2.3.3).
GOVERN: If ARVN are Training or just Patrolled, they Govern also
(in up to 2 spaces other than Saigon with COIN-Control and Support
and where no Training is occurring, 1 space if shaded “Mandate of
Heaven” is in effect). Govern as follows:

•	 If the US is a player and Support+Available exceeds 50, (7.2),
Govern in the highest Population spaces where it is possible to
transfer Aid to Patronage. Shift their Support toward Neutral (even
if unshaded “Mandate” is in effect).
•	 If the US is a Non-player or is not at victory per above, instead take
the most Patronage possible (from 1 or 2 spaces) without shifting
any space to Neutral (so at Active Support or with unshaded
“Mandate” and no shift).
•	 Then, if Govern occurred in exactly 1 space (and shaded “Mandate” is not in effect), or if Aid is at 0, add Aid from the highest
Population space(s) possible.
TRANSPORT: If no such Govern is possible, ARVN instead Transport up to 6 pieces, selecting ARVN Troops then Rangers:

•	 Transport first from a Laos or Cambodia space with such pieces,
then from the South Vietnam space with the most ARVN Troops
above those needed to keep COIN Control.
•	 Do not move so many pieces as to remove COIN Control of the
origin space.
•	 If the Transport accompanies either Train or Patrol, move into 1
Province, first one that has Police but no US or ARVN Troops, or
if there is no such reachable space, move so as to change Control
of the destination space. Within each of these priorities, select the
destination with the highest Population possible.
•	 If the Transport precedes an Assault, move to enable the highest
priority Assault possible per the Assault priorities (8.7.4).
•	 If the Transport occurs during a Sweep, move into spaces already
selected for the Sweep Operation (8.7.5) so as to Activate as many
additional Underground Guerrillas as possible.
•	 If the unshaded “Armored Cavalry” Capability is in effect, then
free Assault in 1 destination space per ARVN Assault priorities,
as applicable (8.7.4).
•	 Finally, flip all Rangers Underground.
•	 If no such Transport is possible, the ARVN execute no Special

19

Activity with the Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).
8.7.3 Patrol. If ARVN did not Train, they Patrol if at least one of
the following conditions are met:

•	 There are NVA or VC units on any LoC adjacent to Saigon.
•	 NVA or VC units on any LoCs would block a Patrol from Saigon
to any City. (Ignore units on LoCs beyond Cities that are also
blocked by NVA or VC. Similarly, NVA or VC in Cities alone do
not trigger a Patrol—the blockage must be due at least in part to
a unit on a LoC.)
•	 ARVN tried to Assault (8.7.4) but were unable to do so.
ARVN Patrol first to defend contested LoCs, then to control Cities,
including filling in behind into Cities vacated during the Patrol
itself, as follows:

•	 Move Police when possible then ARVN Troops, as needed to reach
LoC or City destinations (3.2.2) below, first from spaces with the
most ARVN cubes able to reach the destination except those that
have already been selected as Patrol destinations. Do not leave
any Province so as to lose any COIN Control, drop below 3 total
US and ARVN cubes and Special Forces, nor remove the last US
or ARVN Troop or the last Police there.
•	 First, move cubes onto any LoCs with NVA/VC Guerrillas to get
ARVN cubes equal to the greater of 3 cubes or twice the number
of enemy units there, beginning with those LoCs nearest to Saigon
and working outwards (counting the number of spaces between
Saigon and the LoC). If it is not possible to get the required number
of ARVN cubes to a LoC, do not move any cubes there. If two or
more LoCs with enemy units are the same distance from Saigon,
move first to those of them that have Underground Guerrillas.
When executing this bullet cubes may leave Cities as needed,
even if doing so would remove COIN Control, the last 3 COIN
cubes or Special Forces, or the last Troop or Police there.
•	 Then move cubes to Cities as needed to have all Cities possible
under COIN Control, where possible with at least 3 total US or
ARVN cubes or Special Forces and at least 1 US or ARVN Troop
and 1 Police. Within those priorities, move first to Cities with the
highest Population. (These destinations may include Cities just
departed by other Patrolling cubes).
•	 Then free Assault to remove the most enemy pieces possible,
selecting randomly among the LoCs with most enemies if tied.
IF NONE: If no such Patrol is possible, the ARVN instead try to
Train per 8.7.2 above unless ARVN has already executed a Raid, in
which case they pay for Patrol without moving any pieces.
GOVERN OR TRANSPORT: After Patrolling, Govern or, if not
possible, TRANSPORT, in either case per 8.7.2.
8.7.4 Assault. If ARVN did not play the Event, Train, or Patrol,
the ARVN will Assault if any of the following conditions are met:
•	 ARVN Assault alone (i.e., without help from Transport or Raid)
would change Control of any space, by adding COIN Control,
removing NVA Control, or both.
•	 ARVN Assault alone could remove at least one NVA Troop.
•	 ARVN can now Assault to remove enemy pieces in a space with
an NVA or VC Base and no Underground Guerrillas.
•	 ARVN tried to Sweep but were unable to do so (including during
Monsoon, 2.3.9).

20

Fire in the Lake

If the ARVN Assault, they first execute a Raid per below or, if not
possible, Transport per 8.7.2 above. They then Assault in up to 3
spaces as follows:

•	 First Assault wherever it is possible to remove a Base or roll to
remove a Tunnel marker.
•	 Then Assault so as to reduce the most NVA-Controlled and add
the most COIN-Controlled Population—adding together NVA
Control and COIN Control affected if both would change in the
same space. EXAMPLE: Choose a 1-Pop space where both NVA
Control would be removed and COIN Control added, before
choosing an uncontrolled 1-Pop space where COIN Control would
be added.
•	 Then Assault to remove any spaces’ last enemy pieces.
•	 Finally, Assault to remove 2 or more enemy pieces per space, first
where possible to remove the most enemy pieces.
IF NONE: If no such Assault is possible, the ARVN instead Patrol
per 8.7.3 above, or, if that not possible, Train per 8.7.2.
RAID: Before Assaulting or Sweeping, ARVN Raid (up to 2 spaces
with or adjacent to Rangers)—but only if at least 1 enemy piece will
be removed—as follows:

•	 Move Rangers only if they can do so without removing any COIN
Control from origin spaces.
•	 If moving into a space, move in no more than 1 Ranger, except if
and as more are required to add COIN Control by the end of the
Raid.
•	 Select target spaces first to remove any (unTunneled) Bases, then
to remove the most NVA Control plus add the most COIN Control
possible (including in spaces with Population 0), then to remove
the most Underground Guerrillas possible, finally randomly.
•	 If Raid cannot remove any NVA or VC, instead Transport per
8.7.2, either immediately if the Operation is an Assault or later if
the Operation is a Sweep (8.7.5).
8.7.5 Sweep. If ARVN do not meet conditions for any other Operation (and it is not Monsoon, 2.3.9), they Sweep.
Before Sweeping, Raid per 8.7.4 if possible. Then Sweep up to 3
spaces as follows:
•	 First, select spaces with ARVN cubes and Rangers in place
where there are Underground VC or NVA Guerrillas—first where
either Active or Passive Support, within that priority first where
the Underground Guerrillas include any VC, and within those
priorities first in the spaces with highest Population.
•	 Then move ARVN Troops as follows, without dropping below 3
US plus ARVN cubes and Special Forces in any origin space nor
losing COIN Control of any:
•	 First move Troops into the above selected Sweep spaces so as to
Activate the most Underground Guerrillas possible.
•	 Then move additional cubes so as to add the most COINControlled Population possible, first in the spaces already
selected for the Sweep, then to other spaces (selecting those too
for the Sweep) until a total of 3 spaces have been selected or the
ARVN cannot afford to Sweep more spaces. Within each of these
priorities, first move into spaces with Bases (of any Faction).
•	 If no Raid was executed above, Transport now per 8.7.2 to the
selected Sweep spaces so as to Activate as many additional
Underground Guerrillas as possible.
•	 Finally Activate as many Underground Guerrillas as possible in

the selected Sweep spaces. If a Sweep space has both VC and
NVA Underground Guerrillas and it is not possible to Activate
all of them, Activate VC Guerrillas before NVA ones.
IF NONE: If no such Sweep is possible (such as in Monsoon, 2.3.9),
ARVN instead Assault per 8.7.4 above.
8.7.6 Pacify. Whenever Non-player ARVN Pacify—whether during
Training (3.2.1, 8.7.2) or the Support Phase (6.3.2)—they do so
where able. However, they do so to shift Passive Support to Active
Support only so long as Support + Available (the US victory score,
7.2) remains at 45 or less. Within that restriction, select ARVN Pacify
spaces first where there is no Terror marker, within that priority first
where there is any Opposition, and within that priority first for the
greatest total shift. Remove Terror only if a shift would be achieved
(because enough ARVN Resources will remain after removing the
Terror, the space is not yet at Active Support, and a 1-level shift
would not increase Support + Available above 45).
8.7.7 Redeploy. In the Redeploy Phase (6.4.2), relocate ARVN
Troops and Police as follows:

•	 First, move Troops only to remove all Troops from LoCs and
Provinces without US/ARVN Bases, and from other Provinces or
Cities spaces with the most ARVN Troops beyond those needed
to meet the below Redeploy priorities there.
•	 Move the Troops to help add as much total COIN Control and
(at US/ARVN Bases or Saigon) remove as much NVA Control
as possible.
•	 Then move remaining Troops then Police that must or may move
to ensure at least 3 COIN cubes are in each City (that has no NVA
Control).
•	 Move any Troops that still must move to 1 random can- didate
Redeployment space.
•	 Then move Police, first from LoCs with VC and/or NVA units,
then from the Provinces or Cities with most Police without
removing the last Police from any Province or City nor dropping
any such space below 3 COIN cubes or losing any COIN Control.
•	 If there are no NVA or VC units on the Route 13/Route 14 LoC between
Saigon, An Loc and Ban Me Thuot, move exactly 3 Police there.
•	 Then move Police as needed to keep as much COIN Control as
possible where Troops Redeployed out, then to have at least 1
Police in each COIN Control Province possible, and finally to
have at least 1 Police in each City (with no NVA Control).

8.8 Non-Player US Actions

This subsection governs actions by the US Faction as a
Non-player, as shown on the “Non-player US” flowchart sheet.
When the US are Eligible by the Sequence of Play (2.3) to take an
action (and not executing their Pivotal Event, 8.1.3), consult their
flowchart—beginning at the upper left—and, as needed, the rules
below. When executing free Operations and/or Special Activities
granted by Events (5.5), consult individual flowchart boxes and rules
sections below as appropriate (8.4).
8.8.1 US Policy. If the US is a Non-player, it will follow a varying
strategy—represented by “JFK”, “LBJ”, or “Nixon” US Policy—in
its execution of certain Operations, Special Activities, Events, and
Commitment.
DESIGN NOTE: The labels given US Policy in the game represent
not individual Presidents but rather different US strategies for
Vietnam debated during the period and historically associated with

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Fire in the Lake
Kennedy, Johnson, or Nixon.
SET UP: At start of a game with a Non-player US, mark
the Scenario’s indicated US Policy (either LBJ or JFK,
2.1) on the US Policy track.
COMMITMENT: Each Commitment Phase (6.4), after placing returning US Troop Casualties on the map, check if the Non-player US
Policy changes. If and only if US victory (Support + Available, 7.2)
is 45 or less, roll a die and adjust the US Policy marker accordingly:
•	 If the roll is equal to the number of Coup cards in the RVN Leader
box (2.4.1), US Policy shifts to or remains “JFK”.
•	 If the roll exceeds cards in the RVN Leader box, US Policy is
“LBJ”.
•	 If the roll is less than cards in the RVN Leader box, US Policy is
“Nixon”.

21

•	 Then Assault wherever it is possible to remove more than half of
the Active VC and/or NVA pieces (possibly all, if reinforcements
have been added by Air Lift), if necessary using the same priorities
to select the order between them as in the first bullet above.
•	 Finally Assault in all other spaces where any VC and/or NVA
pieces can be removed, again using the same priorities as above
to determine the exact order if necessary.
IF NONE: If no US Assault is able to remove enemy pieces (even
after Air Lift per below), US instead Sweeps per 8.8.5.
AIR LIFT: First identify 3 potential Air Lift origin spaces (1 in Monsoon) and note the order in which they were chosen. It is possible
that not all of them will be used, depending on how many units they
have that can or must be moved and the number of units needed
in the destination(s). Determine potential origin spaces as follows:

8.8.2 Event or Operations? If the US are to take an action, they
first check for Capability Events as follows:

•	 The first choices are spaces that have do not have any of COIN
Control, Support, or a US Base; among those spaces, first any in
Laos and/or Cambodia. Within those priorities, first choose the
spaces with the most US Troops. The US will move all US units
out of each of these spaces that is selected as an actual Air Lift
origin (not just a potential one).
•	 If the above bullet identifies fewer than 3 potential Air Lift destinations, the US will also Air Lift from spaces with US and ARVN
Troops that are not needed there for either the current Operation
(including spaces where the US have already executed Assaults),
to maintain COIN Control, or if the space has Support to keep at
least 3 COIN units there. Within those priorities, first select those
spaces that have the most units able to be Air Lifted.

8.8.3 Assault. If the US did not play a Capability Event, it Assaults
if either of the following conditions are met:

Then identify one Air Lift destination at a time per the instructions
below, and Air Lift units there from the potential Air Lift origins in
the order they were chosen above. During the Monsoon, only one
destination may be selected. Otherwise, if all three potential origin
spaces were needed for the first destination, no further destination
may be selected; if two origins were needed for the first destination
only one additional destination may be selected, and if the first
potential origin chosen is able to supply units to three destinations
then three destinations may be selected.

The resulting US Policy affects Non-player US placement of pieces
during that Commitment Phase (see 8.8.7 below) and US actions
during the coming campaign (as noted below, in the Non-player US
flowchart, and in the Non-player US Event instructions).

•	 If the next card is a US Capability but the current card is not,
and a d6 roll now exceeds the number of Coup cards in the RVN
Leader box (2.4.1), the US will Pass (2.3.3), gaining 3 Resources.
On the next card, the US will play the Event without having to
roll again.
•	 Otherwise, if the current card is any Faction’s Capability, play the
Event if a d6 roll either now or on the previous card (as above)
exceeds the number of Coup Cards in the RVN Leader box.

•	 Assault alone (including paying Resources for an added ARVN
Assault space per 3.2.4, any Capabilities in effect, and successful
die rolls against Tunnels, but without Air Lift or Air Strike) can
remove at least one VC or NVA Base
•	 There is at least one NVA Troop in any space with US Troops
and/or US Bases.
If any of the shaded “Cobras” or “Abrams” Capabilities are in effect,
stop after 2 spaces. If shaded “Search and Destroy” is in effect,
Assault in Provinces at Support only if either a Base (not a Tunnel)
or NVA Troops will be removed. NOTE: These limits help cap US
Casualties and preserve Support. If ARVN Resources exceed Econ
by at least 3 (1.8.1), pay to add an ARVN Assault in the first space
where doing so would remove additional enemies. Within that,
Assault as follows:

•	 First, Assault wherever it is possible to remove all Active VC and/
or NVA pieces. If necessary to determine the exact order (because
it might be possible to add an ARVN Assault or the number of
Assault spaces is restricted), do so first to remove NVA Control
in spaces with Population 1 or higher; within that priority first
where it is possible to remove a Base or roll to remove a Tunnel.
Within each of those priorities, Assault first in spaces with US
Bases, within that at the highest Population possible, and within
all of those to remove the most enemy pieces possible.
•	 Next conduct a Special Activity per below, either Air Lift, or if
that is not possible, Air Strike.

In all cases move US units before ARVN, and within that move
Troops before Special Forces (Irregulars or Rangers). Move Troops
into Laos or Cambodia only if the US Policy is “Nixon”, and even
then only if it is not Monsoon (2.3.9).
Select the destination(s) as follows:

•	 If the current Operation is a Sweep (8.8.5), select Air Lift
destinations as per the instructions on how to move units during
a Sweep.
•	 If the current Operation is an Assault, select Air Lift destinations
per the third Assault bullet above (“Assault wherever it is possible
to remove more than half of the Active VC and/or NVA pieces”),
including its secondary nested priorities, and move just enough
Troops there to remove as many enemy pieces as possible.
•	 If it is possible to select further Air Lift destinations, Air Lift to
get both US Troops and COIN Control to spaces with Police but
no Active Support (choose randomly if there are more such spaces
than may be selected for the Air Lift).
NOTE: It is possible for the three bullets above to select spaces that
have already been identified as potential Air Lift origins. If this happens, remove those spaces from the list of origins, and if necessary
identify additional potential Air Lift origins per the bullets above.

Fire in the Lake

•	 If at this point any selected Air Lift origin spaces that were chosen
by the first Air Lift bullet above (no COIN Control, Support or US
Base) still have US units left, move as many of them as possible
to the last Air Lift destination selected, even if they are not needed
for either the Operation or Control.
•	 If it is still possible to select further Air Lift destinations, move 1
Special Forces unit (Irregular or Ranger) to an unoccupied space
in Laos or Cambodia.
EXAMPLE: During a US Assault under “JFK” Policy, the NVA
Controls no spaces in South Vietnam but in each of two spaces there
is a VC Base protected only by 2 Active Guerrillas. If the US can
Air Lift enough Troops there to remove the Bases, they will do so.
AIR STRIKE: If no Air Lift could be executed, or if the US Policy is
“LBJ” after Patrol, Sweep or Train Operations (see 8.8.4-.7 below),
the US instead Air Strikes after its Operation if at least one of the
following conditions is met:

•	 An Air Strike could remove at least one VC or NVA piece.
•	 The Trail could be degraded by an Air Strike that rolls enough
hits (i.e., the Trail is above 0 if the shaded “AAA” Capability is
not in play, above 2 if it is, and no Momentum Event prevents it).
If the US Air Strikes, roll one six-sided die to determine Air Strike
hits and apply them as follows:

•	 If possible, spend 2 hits to degrade the Trail.
•	 If the unshaded “Arc Light” Capability is in effect, use it to Air
Strike in the highest priority Province below that has no US or
ARVN pieces.
•	 Air Strike so as to remove NVA Control from the most Population
possible (not a 0 Population), ceasing removal in each space once
NVA Control is removed even if additional Air Strike targets
remain there.
•	 Then Air Strike on LoCs that have US or ARVN pieces, beginning
with those closest to Saigon and working outwards.
•	 Then Air Strike to remove Bases, then the most pieces possible;
within each of those priorities first in spaces with Active Opposition (and US or ARVN pieces), and within that priority first in
spaces with the lowest Population.
If no such Air Strike is possible, execute no Special Activity if the
Operation was Assault or Sweep, or instead Advise if the Operation
was Patrol or Train (see 8.8.4, “ADVISE”, below).
8.8.4 Patrol. If the US did not play a Capability Event, Pass or
execute an Assault, and it is now Monsoon (i.e., the next card is a
Coup, 2.3.9), the US will Patrol (3.2.2) to move all US Troops in
Laos and Cambodia to the fewest possible spaces in South Vietnam,
if possible a City (or, only if necessary to get all US Troops into
South Vietnam, Cities) with no Active Support.

Then, if any US Troops end up on a LoC with NVA or VC units (e.g.,
because that was the only space in South Vietnam they could reach),
Assault to remove the largest possible number of enemy pieces.
If no such Patrol is possible because there are no US Troops in either
Laos or Cambodia, the US instead Trains per 8.8.7 below.
After the Patrol, if the US Policy is “LBJ” the US will Air Strike per
8.8.3 above, or if that is not possible Advise per below, or if that is
not possible either, Air Lift per 8.8.3 above. If no Special Activity
is possible, the US will execute execute no Special Activity with
their Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).

ADVISE: Advise in up to 2 spaces (that were not selected for Training, 4.2.1) as follows.

•	 First, use ARVN cubes to Assault or Activate Irregulars or Rangers
(in that order, if more than one is possible) where able to remove
enemies so as to add any COIN Control or remove any NVA
Control (even if 0 Population). Then do so to remove enemy
Bases, and finally to remove the most pieces possible.
•	 If Advise has not yet occurred in 2 spaces, use ARVN to Sweep
to Activate the most Underground enemy Guerrillas possible.
•	 If the shaded “Search and Destroy” Capability is in effect, do not
Advise to Assault with ARVN in any Provinces with Support.
•	 If Aid is 30 or less, add +6 Aid.
•	 If no such Advise is possible, the US instead Air Lifts per 8.8.3
above, or if that is not possible Air Strikes per 8.8.3. If that is
not possible either, the US executes no Special Activity with its
Operation (Op Only, 2.3.4).
8.8.5 Sweep. If the US did not play a Capability Event, Pass or execute an Assault and it is not now Monsoon (i.e., the next card is not
a Coup, 2.3.9), the US will Sweep (3.2.3) if either of the following
conditions are met:
•	 There is at least one Underground Guerrilla in any space with
Support.
•	 The US tried to Train or Assault but were unable to do so.

If the US Sweep, they begin by selecting Sweep spaces. If either or
both of the shaded “Booby Traps” and “Combined Action Platoons”
Capabilities are in effect, they stop after selecting a maximum of
2 spaces; otherwise they select as many spaces as the instructions
below allow.
For the Sweep the US selects spaces with Underground Guerrillas,
first where there is at least one US piece, then up to 2 additional
spaces with no US pieces. Within each of these priorities, first select
spaces with Support (Active or Passive); within that priority select
spaces with any Bases (of any Faction), and within those priorities
select the spaces with the highest Population.
NOTE: The spaces selected above are the only ones the US will
Sweep in or into during this Operation. It is possible for the US
to select spaces it cannot reach with Sweep movement or where
no US Troops may move due to a heavy NVA presence, or where
Air Lift later removes all US units from selected spaces before the
Operation is finished.
Then move US Troops into selected Sweep spaces that have no
more than 2 NVA Troops in them, changing no Control in any
origin spaces (neither removing COIN Control nor adding NVA
Control, 1.7) nor removing the last 3 COIN units from any space
with Support, as follows:
•	 Move Troops into Laos or Cambodia only if the US Policy is
“Nixon”.
•	 Within the above restrictions, move as many US Troops as
possible from Laos and/or Cambodia to any Sweep space that
needs reinforcements.
•	 First move to selected Sweep spaces where the added Troops
would make it possible to Activate all Underground Guerrillas
there.
•	 Then move to selected Sweep spaces where the added Troops
would make it possible to Activate more than half the Underground
Guerrillas there.

© 2018 GMT Games, LLC

Fire in the Lake
•	 Finally move additional Troops beyond those needed to Activate
Underground Guerrillas to add COIN Control to selected Sweep
spaces.
•	 Within each of the three bullets above, move only as many Troops
to each space as needed for that bullet, and move first to spaces
with Support; within that priority move first to spaces with any
Base or Bases; and within those priorities move first to spaces
with the highest Population.
After Sweep movement, if US Policy is “JFK” or “Nixon” (8.8.1),
Air Lift per 8.8.3. NOTE: For Air Lift during a Sweep, the Air Lift
instruction refers back to the above Sweep priorities for moving
Troops.
Once all Sweep and Air Lift movements are resolved, Activate as
many Guerrillas as possible in all selected Sweep spaces. If there any
such space has more Underground Guerrillas than can be Activated,
the US will Activate VC Guerrillas before NVA ones.
IF NONE: If no such Sweep is possible, the US will instead Train
per 8.8.7, or if that is not possible either, Pass (adding +3 ARVN
Resources, 2.3.3).
AIR STRIKE: If US Policy is “LBJ”, or if no Air Lift could be
executed above, the US now Air Strikes per 8.8.3 above.
8.8.6 Play Event? If the US did not play a Capability Event, Pass,
Assault, Sweep or Patrol, and it it is possible to play the Event, the
US does so unless the Event is Ineffective (8.1), following any US
Event Instructions (8.4.1) for this Event.
8.8.7 Train. If the US did not play the Event or Pass, and no conditions for any of the other Operations were met, the US Train (3.2.1)
as follows:

•	 First, place 1 Irregular each—or 2 Irregulars each if US Policy
is “JFK”— first in spaces with no US Base; within that priority
in Provinces before Cities, and within those priorities first where
there are no Irregulars already.
•	 Then, if US Policy is “JFK” or “LBJ”, at 1 US Base place up to 6
ARVN cubes (Troops and Police as evenly as possible, beginning
with the type with fewest in the space alredy, Troops if tied, 8.1.2);
if no ARVN cubes are Available instead place up to 2 Rangers.
If US Policy is “Nixon”, place in the reverse order—Rangers if
possible, otherwise cubes. Place these units first where doing so
would remove NVA Control and/or add COIN Control.
•	 Then—if ARVN are a player with Patronage above 22, Train
in Saigon—placing no pieces (if not already done above)—and
transfer up to 3 Patronage to Resources, if possible.
•	 If in effect, use the unshaded “Combined Action Platoons” to add
1 Police to a space with US Troops and the fewest Police.
•	 If there was no transfer of Patronage above, Train wherever beyond the above spaces helps to be able to Pacify to the maximum
extent— if anywhere and placing no pieces—and then Pacify per
8.8.8 below.
NOTE: If unshaded “CORDS” is in effect, the US will try to Pacify
in a 2nd space as part of each Training Operation.
IF NONE: If such Training is not possible (EXAMPLE: ARVN are
a Non-player, all Irregulars are already on the map and there are
not enough ARVN Resources above Econ to place ARVN pieces or
Pacify), the US instead Sweeps per 8.8.5 above unless it is Monsoon
(2.3.9), otherwise Passes (adding +3 ARVN Resources, 2.3.3).

23

AIR STRIKE OR ADVISE: After Training, if US Policy is “LBJ”,
Air Strike per 8.8.3 above. If no such Air Strike is possible, or if
US Policy is “JFK” or “Nixon”, instead Advise per 8.8.4 above.
8.8.8 Pacify. Whenever the Non-player US Pacifies—whether during
Training (3.2.1, 8.8.7) or the Support Phase (6.3.1)—it does so to the
maximum extent. If during Training, it does so first where no Police.
Within that or if not during Training, it does so first for the greatest
total shift, then where there is no Terror marker, then randomly.
Remove Terror only if a shift would be achieved (because enough
ARVN Resources above Econ, 1.8.1, will remain after removing the
Terror and the space is not yet at Active Support).
8.8.9 Commitment. In the Commitment Phase (6.5), the US first
places any returning US Troop Casualties on the map per the instructions below, then determines the US Policy for the next Campaign
(8.8.1). Then it moves US Bases then Troops between map and
Available Forces per the new or continued US Policy as follows:
•	 JFK Policy—Add 2 US Bases to the map; then add or withdraw
Troops to or from the map to get as close as possible to 15 US
Troops in the Available Forces box.
•	 LBJ Policy—Add 2 US Bases to the map; then add or withdraw
Troops to get as close as possible to 5 US Troops in Available.
•	 Nixon Policy—Withdraw 2 US Bases from the map until none
are left outside Saigon, leaving 1 US Base in Saigon if there;
then add or withdraw Troops to get as close as possible to 25 US
Troops in Available.

When adding US Bases to the map, place them in Cities or Provinces
with COIN Control but no US or ARVN Base already.
When placing US Troops, either returning Casualties or Committing
new ones, place them so as to get as close as possible to the same
number of US Troops at each on-map US Base, or if no other spaces
are possible, in Saigon. When withdrawing US Troops, do so first
from spaces without US Bases outside Saigon, then to leave as close
as possible to the same number of US Troops at each remaining onmap US Base. NOTE: Non-player US Commitment does not move
pieces between spaces.

8.9 1-Player Victory

A lone player plays either US and ARVN together or NVA and VC
together (1.5). The player uses the lower victory margin (7.3) of the
player’s two Factions and never wins during a Victory Phase (6.1,
7.2). Alternatively, if preferred, the player plays just any 1 Faction
against 3 Non-players.

•	 To succeed, the player must avoid a win by any Non-player
through each Coup Round and have the highest victory margin(s)
after the final Round.
	 1-Player Easy Option: For the least challenge, allow Non-players when granted a Limited Operation by Sequence of Play (2.3.4)
to carry out an Operation in just the first space selected by the
priorities, and with no Special Activity (ignoring the Non-player
exception allowing a full multi-space Operation and Special
Activity, 8.1).
1-Player Difficulty Option A: For greater challenge, regardless
of scenario or Period Events Option (2.1), set up either the shaded
or unshaded Capabilities listed for the Medium Scenario—if
the player is a Counterinsurgent, only the shaded; if Insurgent,
only unshaded.

24

Fire in the Lake

1-Player Difficulty Option B: For even greater challenge,
beginning with the 2nd Coup Round, the player also must avoid
having a lower victory margin (with any player Faction) than
any Non-player Faction during each Victory Phase. NOTE:
Ignore this requirement during the 1st Coup Round.
NON-PLAYER VICTORY: If the player fails to avoid such an outcome, the Non-player with the highest victory margin (ties to VC
then ARVN then NVA) wins the Vietnam conflict:

•	 If VC—Maoist Revolution! The countryside has surrounded the
cities, which one by one begin to fly the NLF’s red-blue-gold
as all hold by the foreigners and their puppets on public order
crumbles.
•	 If NVA—Mechanized Reunification! North Vietnamese military
momentum and logistical wherewithal in the South portend the
arrival of armored NVA columns in soon-to-be Ho Chi Minh City.
•	 If ARVN—Mandarin Redux! Propped by foreign aid and
firepower, the Saigon clique cements its hold on the land and
people of South Vietnam, prying away the last toeholds of the
unification movement.
•	 If US—McNamara Redemption! US and allied forces depart in
good order as the Southern populace turns its back on the NLF
and hands Saigon the legitimacy to resist the North for years to
come.
PLAYER DRAW OR VICTORY: If the player does survive to the
final Round, subtract the highest Non-player victory margin from the
lowest player victory margin to gauge the outcome. A difference of 5
or less is a stalemate, 6 or more a victory for the player’s Faction(s):

•	 1 to 5—Soldiering On! US commitment has faded, but neither
popular revolt nor ARVN collapse in the face of Northern pressure
are in prospect. The Republic of Vietnam stands fragile but may
yet have a future. The stalemated Cold War struggle for Vietnam
will exceed 10,000 days.
•	 6 or more, Player as US and/or ARVN—Communism
Contained! More than peace with honor, the United States and its
allies have demonstrated that the Free World will fight communist
aggression wherever it may probe. The Republic of Vietnam is
balancing its own style of governance with an extension of its
writ into hamlet and paddy. As Moscow and Peking question their
investments in Hanoi, the NLF withers on the vine.
•	 6 or more, Player as NVA and/or VC—National Liberation! The
twin strategy of People’s War and force modernization has brought
the country to the brink of unity in independence. Colonialism is
beating its final retreat from Vietnam. The US Imperialists and
their Saigon lackeys will soon be running for their helicopters
and headed to California.
EXAMPLE: A solo US/ARVN player using Difficulty Option B avoids
Non-player victory by keeping both US and ARVN margins equal to
or above both NVA and VC margins upon each Victory Phase beyond
the 1st Coup card. At game end, Total Support is 30 and there are
20 US Troops and 2 US Bases in Available, for a final US victory
margin of +2. With Patronage stacked up and widespread COIN
Control, the ARVN margin is even higher. The NVA victory margin
is -8 and the VC’s -4. The 6-point advantage over the Non-players
(US +2 compared to VC -4) earns the player a razor-thin victory—“Communism Contained!”

SET UP (2.1)
General

Choose a scenario from the next two
pages and any No Non-Player (1.5),
Deception/Handicap (7.3), 1-Player
difficulty (8.9), or Period Events (right)
options desired. Prepare the deck per the
instructions below. Give each player a
Faction foldout and assign Factions
to players (1.5). If Non-players (8.0)
are being used, keep the Non-player
Operations flowcharts and the Random
Spaces foldout nearby.

Deck Preparation

Separate out the 6 Coup cards and 4
Pivotal Events and shuffle the other 120
Event cards. Place or remove Coup or
Pivotal Event cards as instructed.
•	 Shuffle and randomly deal a number
of Event cards (by Period, if desired)
into equal piles as specified in the
scenario. Shuffle 1 Coup card into
each pile and stack 1 pile onto the
other to form a face-down draw deck
in easy view of all players.
•	 Set aside the remaining Event cards.
They will not be used and may not be
inspected.

Period Events Option

If desired for events more akin
to the historical periods covered,
select Event cards by scenario as
follows.

Short: 1965-1967

Westy’s War. Set out the “AAA”
card and marker—the shaded
Capability (5.3) is in effect. Then
deal event cards into 8-card piles
only from those marked “1965”.

Medium: 1968-1972

A Better War. Set out the Capability
cards and markers as directed. Deal
event cards into 12-card piles from
those marked “1968”.

Full: 1964-1972

Nam. Form the top pile from 12
random “1964” cards, the 2nd and
3rd topmost piles from 12 “1965”
cards each, and the bottom 3 piles
from 12 “1968” cards each.
NOTE: There are 24 “1964”, 48
“1965”, and 48 “1968” cards.

						               													<description>(from GMT website:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Volume IV in GMT&amp;rsquo;s COIN Series dives headlong into the momentous and complex battle for South Vietnam. A unique multi-faction treatment of the Vietnam War, Fire in the Lake will take 1 to 4 players on US heliborne sweeps of the jungle and Communist infiltration of the South, and into inter-allied conferences, Saigon politics, interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, air defense of Northern infrastructure, graduated escalation, and media war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Renowned designer and modern warfare expert Mark Herman joins COIN Series creator Volko Ruhnke for a collaborative production not to be missed.  Fire in the Lake features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, and A Distant Plain, with a pack of twists that take the Series to another level, including:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pivotal events that trump initiative (Tet Offensive, Vietnamization, Easter Offensive, and Linebacker II)&amp;#10;     Inter-coup campaign effects that vary by RVN leader&amp;#10;     Counterinsurgent guerrillas (US-led Irregulars and ARVN Rangers)&amp;#10;     Insurgent troops (NVA) for direct force-on-force engagements&amp;#10;     Tunneled VC and NVA bases&amp;#10;     Trail construction and degradation&amp;#10;     A larger-than-ever event deck for even greater play variety&amp;#10;     Short and medium-length scenarios with either random or period-event options&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman &amp;amp; Volko Ruhnke&amp;#10;SERIES DEVELOPER: Mike Bertucelli&amp;#10;MAP ART: Chechu Nieto&amp;#10;COUNTER &amp;amp; CARDS ART &amp;amp; RULES LAYOUT: Mark Simonitch&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
