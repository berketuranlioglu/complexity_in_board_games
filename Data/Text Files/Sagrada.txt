and watch a video explanation.

Each round, players will take turns drafting from
a pool of dice, placing these dice on their window.
Players must place them within the color and
shade restrictions on their Window card, and never
have adjacent dice of the same color or value.
After 10 rounds, players score points based on
public and private objectives — the highest scoring
artisan is the winner!

Player Setup

Game Setup

1•	 Shuffle the Private Objective Cards (Gray die

on the back) and give 1 to each player face down.
Players may secretly look at this card.
2•	 Give each player 2 random Window Pattern
Cards and 1 Window Frame Player Board.
Each player selects 1 of the 4 Window Patterns to
play (front or back), the other card isn’t used.
Note: Windows have varying difficulty from level 3
(easiest) to 6 (hardest) as indicated near the name.
Difficult windows give more Favor Tokens
3•	 Give each player the number of Favor Tokens
indicated by the difficulty number on their card.
4•	 Slide the selected Window Pattern Card into the
bottom of the Player Board.
5•	 Place a Score Marker that matches the color of
each player’s board next to the Round Track,
these are used during End Game Scoring.

A•	 Place the Round Track near the center of the

play area.
B•	 Shuffle all of the Tool Cards and place 3 face up
in the center of the play area.
C•	 Shuffle all of the Public Objective cards (Blue
die on the back) and place 3 face up.
D•	 Place all 90 dice in the Dice Bag.
E•	 Randomly select a player to be the Start Player
and give them the Dice Bag. One suggested method
is whoever most recently visited a cathedral.
Set aside all remaining Objective, Tool and Window
Cards, they are not used during the game

Note: Setup is the same for 2, 3 or 4 players

Gameplay

Placing Dice

Each game of Sagrada is played over 10 rounds.

When placing a die on a Window:

Each round, the Start Player (the player with the
Dice Bag) pulls dice out of the Dice Bag at random
and rolls them. The number of dice pulled depends
on the number of players:
2 Players - 5 Dice
3 Players - 7 Dice
4 Players - 9 Dice
2 per player, plus 1 additional die
Once rolled, these dice form the Draft Pool.

• First die: Each player’s first die of the game must be
placed on an edge or corner space
• Every other die must be adjacent to a previously
placed die, touching diagonally (different row and
column) or orthogonally (same row or column)
• The die must match the color or value restriction
of the space. White spaces have no restrictions
Example - A red space on the window may only be
filled by a red die (any value). A space showing a 3
may only be filled by a die showing a 3 (any color)
• Dice may never be placed orthogonally adjacent to
a die of the same color or the same value. Example
- Two red dice or two dice showing a 3 may not be
placed side by side
Players may choose not to draft a die during their turn.

Beginning with the Start Player, each player takes a
turn in clockwise order. On a player’s turn, they may
perform each of the following actions in any order:
• Select 1 die from the Draft Pool and place it in
an open space on their Window
• Use 1 Tool Card by spending Favor Tokens
Each action is optional — A player may choose to
perform both actions, only one action or pass their
turn taking no actions.
Turns proceed clockwise with each player taking
a turn or passing. Example - Emily takes a turn (1),
then Ben (2), then Mari (3)
Ben

5

Note: Any die may be placed on a white space as
long as all the above restrictions are obeyed

Example: This Red 2 die has
three spaces that meet all
placement restrictions

(Start Player)

Once the last player has completed their first turn,
the round continues in reverse order (counterclockwise). Beginning with the last player,
each player takes a second turn (selecting a second
die from the Draft Pool, etc.) Example - Mari takes
her second turn (4), then Ben (5), then Emily (6)
Once the Start Player has taken their second turn,
proceed to the End of the Round.

Tip: Being the first to use each Tool Card costs
the fewest Favor Tokens. However, Tool Card
abilities become more useful later in the game
as player’s Windows fill with dice.

Tip: Try to avoid placing dice next to a matching space
(such as a 2 die next to a 2 space or red die next to a red
space) so a future die can still be placed in that space

Tool Cards & Favor Tokens
Players may spend Favor Tokens to gain a special
ability from 1 Tool Card during their turn:
1. Place Favor Tokens on the Tool Card — 1 if
there aren’t any tokens on the card, otherwise
place 2.
2. Use the ability listed on the Tool Card
Players may choose not to use a Tool Card on
their turn.

the game — proceed to End Game Scoring.

This example uses the Public
Objectives shown in G ame S etup and

this final Window.
Public Objectives
B
Column Color Variety: 5 VP from
each of column 4 and 5, 10 VP total. C
0 points for column 1 and 3 since
they’re incomplete, 0 VP from column
2 since there’s a repeated green die. D
Fractal Drops
Light Shades: 2 VP for each set of
1-value & 2-value dice (1’s at B2, B4. 2’s at A3, D4, B5). 4 VP total
for two pairs, the third 2-value die is not part of a pair and is not
counted.
Color Variety: Three sets of 1 of each color give 4 VP each, 12 VP
total.
T ip : The number of Sets of a type will always be the count of dice
with the fewest quantity of that type
Private Objective: Shades of Purple would sum the values for
purple dice (C1, C4, and A5), giving 5 + 6 + 6 = 17 VP total.
Favor Token: 1 VP for each remaining. None remain so 0 VP.
Open Spaces: -1 VP for each open space (A1, B3, and C3), -3 VP total.
Total: 10 VP + 4 VP + 12 VP + 17 VP + 0 VP - 3 VP = 40 VP Total!

End Game Scoring

Dice Placement Mistakes

All remaining dice are placed on the Round
Track, covering the number space for the just
completed round. If multiple dice remain (due
to players skipping a draft action) these do not
cover additional number spaces.

The Dice Bag is passed clockwise to the next
player. This player is now the Start Player —
players then begin another round. Example - Ben is
now the start player for the second round

The game ends at the end of the 10th round.
1. Clear the dice off the Round Track and flip it
over to the Score Track side.
2. Use each player’s Score Marker to track their
position on the Score Track, flipping the marker if
they exceed 50 points.

If a Player’s Window is ever found to break any of the placement
restrictions, that player must immediately remove dice (of their
choice) from their Window until all restrictions are obeyed. These
dice are out of play and any resulting open spaces will count
against their score as normal.

Solo Play Rules
When playing Sagrada by yourself, you’re trying to beat a Target
Score. The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice
on the Round Track at the end of the game.

Setup

Each player tallies their Victory Point total, gaining
points from:
• Each Public Objective Card - Players may
gain points from each card multiple times.
Row/Column-based objectives only score for
completed Rows/Columns (no open spaces).
• Their Private Objective Card - Summing the
values of their dice of the specified color.
• Favor Tokens - 1 Victory Point for each
unspent token.
• Players Lose 1 Victory Point for each open
space on their window.
The player with the highest Victory Point
total is the winner. Ties are broken by most
points from Private Objectives, most remaining
Favor Tokens, then finally by reverse player
order in the final round.

Each game is set up as normal with a few small changes:
• Favor Tokens are not used.
• 2 Public Objectives and 2 Private Objective are placed face up.
• Place Tool Cards based on the level of difficulty you wish to play,
between 1 Tool (Extreme Challenge) and 5 Tools (Easy).

Gameplay

Each game is played as normal in 10 rounds, with a few small changes:
• Each round, pull 4 dice from the Dice Bag and roll them.
• Take 2 turns, choosing to draft and place a die (as normal) and/or use
a Tool Card, or pass.

Tool Cards

Eglomise Brush

Tool Cards may be used only once by spending
dice from the Draft Pool. To use a Tool Card place a
die from the Draft Pool that matches the color shown on the top-left
of the Tool Card.
Note: Each Tool Card may only be used once. Both the die spent
and the Tool Card are now removed from play.

care to not change the value of any dice. If no dice remain, use a
Score Marker as a placeholder.

End Game Scoring

The game ends after the end of 10th round. Before flipping the Round
Track, add up the Target Score.
• The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the
Round Track. Dice used to pay for Tool Cards are not counted.
• Tally your Victory Point total as normal (selecting only one of the
two Private Objectives), however, you lose 3 Victory Points for
each open space.
• If your Victory Point total is greater than the Target Score, you win!
