RULEBOOK
Following the success of robotic rover missions, the United
Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars
Exploration (DOME). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year
2037. In the decades after the Mars Base Camp was established,
private exploration companies started working towards the
creation of a self-sustaining colony.
As a chief astronaut from one of these enterprises, you want
to be a pioneer in developing the biggest, most advanced colony
on Mars by achieving both DOME mission goals as well as your
company’s private agenda.

In the beginning, you are very dependent on supplies from
Earth, and have to travel a lot between the Mars Space Station
and the surface of the planet. As the colony expands over time,
you will construct mines, power generators, water extractors,
greenhouses, oxygen condensers, and shelters. The aim is to
become a self-sufficient colony, independent of any terrestrial
organization. This will require carefully balancing the importance
of water, air, power, and food — the things we need to survive.
Do you dare take part in humankind’s biggest challenge?

GAME OVERVIEW
The game is played over several rounds, each
consisting of two phases: The COLONIZATION
PHASE and the SHUTTLE PHASE.
During the COLONIZATION PHASE, each player
takes a turn, during which they take actions.
The actions a player is able to take depends
on the side of the board they are on. If players
are on the Space Station in orbit, they can take
blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and
take supplies from the warehouse. If players are
at the colony on the surface of the planet, they
can construct buildings with their bots, upgrade
these buildings using blueprints, hire scientists
and take new contracts, welcome new ships, and
explore the planet’s surface with their rover.

2

In the SHUTTLE PHASE, players may travel
between the colony and the space station in orbit.
All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each
other and some are required for the colony to
grow. Building shelters for colonists to live in
requires oxygen, generating oxygen requires
plants, growing plants requires water, extracting
water from ice requires power, generating power
requires mining minerals, and mining minerals
requires colonists.
Upgrading the colony’s ability to provide each
of these resources is vital. As the colony grows,
more shelters are needed so that the colonists
can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.

During the game, players are trying to complete
missions. Once a total of three missions have
been completed, the game ends.
To win the game, players must contribute the
most to the development of the first colony on
Mars. This is represented during the game by
players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The
player with the most OP at the end of the game
is declared the winner.

B. LABORATORY
Here is where you will place
and develop technologies you
research.

B

F

A. STORAGE

Your Resources will be stored here.
There are five different Resources in the game:
Minerals, Batteries, Water, Plants, and Oxygen. The
number of Resources of each type you can store on
your Player board is equal to the number of Shelter
tiles you have on the map plus one. (e.g. if you have
one Shelter, you can store two of each Resource).
The order in which each Resource appears on
your board is very important. A Resource to the
left of an arrow is needed to build the Building of
the type to the right of the arrow. For example,
you need power (the Battery Resource) to build a
Water Extractor, then you need Water to build a
Greenhouse, and so on.

Each player chooses a color and takes the following:

3.	 1 OP marker, placed on the 0 space of the OP
track.

F. HANGAR
Your Private Ships are moved from
your Depot to here during the game.

4.	 1 Resource of each of the 5 types, placed on
the matching spaces of your Storage ( A ).

11

13.	 5 Progress cubes, 1 placed below each of the
Resources.
14.	 3 Private Goal cards: Shuffle the Private Goal
cards and deal each player 3 of them face
down. Players should look at their own cards
but keep them secret from the other players.
Place the rest back in the box.

5.	 1 Crystal, placed in the Depot ( E ).
6.	 1 Shelter Tech tile (set-aside earlier), placed
on the middle space of the 2nd column in
your Laboratory ( B ).
7.	 5 Ships, placed on the top 5 Depot spaces.
8.	 5 Shelter Buildings, 4 placed in their
positions on the right side of your Player
board, and 1 placed building-side up in one of
the Shelter starting positions according to
the number of players (as per the images to
the right and in the indicated hexes on the
main board). Shelters should be placed in a
position nearest to their respective players
for convenience.

2 players 	

9.	 4 Bots. 3 are placed beside your Player board,
and 1 on your Shelter on the main board.
10.	 8 Advanced Building markers, placed beside
your Player board.
11.	 12 Colonists. 3 are placed in the Living
Quarters and the remaining 9 are placed
beside the Player board.

PLAYER SETUP

Your Colonists will go here.
At the beginning of the
game, you have space for 4
Colonists, and 3 of the slots
are occupied. 2 more slots
become available for each
additional Shelter you build.

There are 8 spaces in your Depot
for storing Crystals. At the
beginning of the game, however,
you only have 3 slots available as
your Ships are taking 5 of the slots.

The player who has seen the film “The Martian”
the most times is the first player.
In clockwise order, starting
with the first player, each
player places their Player
marker in any empty Turn
Order space (1-8) and may
immediately receive the
benefit of that space (see
page 2 of the Reference book).

The player whose Player marker is on the
highest numbered Turn Order space places the
Shuttle on one of the Red Travel spaces (with
a number 1 in it), either on the Colony or Orbit
side (their choice).

Example of placing the Shuttle:

GAINING CRYSTALS

IMPORTANT TERMS
•	 Whenever you gain something during the
game, it is taken from the general supply.
Only take it from the Warehouse on the
Main board if specifically told to do so
and the Warehouse icon is depicted.
•	 Resources are placed in your Storage (up to
your limit).
•	 Colonists are placed in your Living Quarters
(if there is an available slot). The capacity
of your Living Quarters is 4, plus 2 for each
additional Shelter you have constructed. Any
Colonists that would be placed in the Living
Quarters when there is not enough space, are
placed next to your Player board instead.

•	 A group of connected Buildings of the same
type is known as a Building Complex. The
number of Buildings within the Complex
indicates its size. A single Building not
connected to another one of the same type is
not a Complex.
•	 Anything that is done in Turn Order means
that you follow the order of the Player markers
on the Turn Order spaces, starting with 1 and
ending with 8.
•	 An empty hex is a hex on the board with
nothing in it at all.

Gained Crystals are initially placed below your Depot and
are only moved into your Depot at the start of your turn.

A GREENHOUSE BUILDING COMPLEX

•	 Any Crystals gained are placed in the space
below your Depot; you cannot spend them
on the turn you gain them. At the beginning
of your next turn, move these Crystals to
your Depot. If there is not enough space,
place any excess back in the supply.
•	 Whenever you must pay a cost of something
(Resource or Crystal), remove it from your
Player board and place it back in the general
supply.

An empty hex.

•	 No hex may contain more than one piece
at the end of any player’s turn. (Pieces are
Bots, Rovers, Colonists, or Advanced Building
markers.)

Note: The Generator is not a Complex as it is a standalone
Building.

GAMEPLAY
Each round is divided into two phases:

O rder o f P lay :

COLONIZATION PHASE:

I n the pic ture below, the o rder of play wo ul d be : P urple, Gre e n , Ye llow, and Blue.

In turn order, each player takes a turn during
which they perform 1 Main action and optionally 1
Executive action.

SHUTTLE PHASE:
The Shuttle either travels between Orbit and the
Colony, or it moves closer to traveling.

COLONIZATION PHASE
On your turn, you must perform one Main action.
You may also perform one Executive action
either before or after your Main action. Executive
actions are described on page 18.

If you contribute to any of the Mission cards, you
gain 1 or 2 Crystals as depicted on the card. See
page 19 for more details of the Mission cards.

There are a number of different Main actions
you can take on the Main board. If your Player
marker is on the Orbit side of the board, only
the Orbital Station actions are available to you.

Similarly, if your Player marker is on the Colony
side of the board, only the Colony actions are
available to you.

Some of the actions depict a Red Colonist icon
and/or a Teal Colonist icon, and/or a Crystal.

TEAL COLONIST:

Example of Teal Colonist action:

In this phase, all players take one turn. The order
in which players take turns is determined by the
order of the Player markers on the Turn Order
spaces, starting with the leftmost space on the
Orbit side (1) and proceeding right, ending at the
rightmost space on the Colony side (8).

When your turn is complete, lay your Player
marker down as a reminder that you’ve finished
your turn. The next player then takes their turn.

MAIN BOARD ACTIONS

This icon can be found at the bottom
of some of the action icons and
indicates that one or more Colonists
may be moved to your Working Area
to boost the power of the action. Any Colonists
in your Working Area are returned to your Living
Quarters at the end of the round if you travel.
See the individual actions for full details on this.

CRYSTAL:
If this icon is printed at the bottom
of the action, it means the action
can be boosted by spending
Crystals. See the individual actions for full
details on how the action is boosted.

8

Blue c ho oses the Res upply ac tio n and
c ho oses to take 1 Water. He then bo osts
the ac tio n by sending two Co lo nists to his
Wo r king A rea to allow him to take 1 mo re
Water and 1 C r ystal to o.

E xamples o f plac ement :

RED COLONIST:
This icon can be found at the top
of some action icons and indicates
that in order to perform the
action, you must place one of your
Colonists from your Living Quarters
onto one of the Action slots.
If there are currently no Colonists of other
players on the Action slots for this action,
there is no additional cost to take the action.
Otherwise, for each other player color of
Colonists already present, you must either pay
1 Crystal or move a Colonist from your Living
Quarters to your Working Area. The number of
Colonists of each color does not matter, only
the number of different colors present. If two or
more other colors of Colonists are present, you
can combine paying Crystals and/or Colonists.
2-player game: The additional cost to take the
action is 1 Crystal / Colonist for each Colonist
(both yours and your opponent’s) already on
Action slots.
Actions without this icon mean that you may
take the action without placing a Colonist.
Simply declare that you are taking the action
and then resolve it.

I t is Pur ple’s tur n, and he wants to take
the Obtain Bluepr int ac tio n. Two of the
Ac tio n s lots are cur rently o ccupied
(1 Blue and 1 Yellow), so Pur ple must
pay a total of 2 of any co mbinatio n of
C r ystals o r Co lo nists moved fro m their
Liv ing Quar ters to their Wo r king A rea.
He dec ides to pay 1 C r ystal and move 1
Co lo nist to his Wo r king A rea. He co uld
pay 2 C r ystals o r move 2 Co lo nists to his
Wo r king A rea instead.

If all Action slots are filled, before you
take the action, remove all Colonists of the
player or players with the most Colonists
on those Action slots (which could be your
own). Place the Colonists in their respective
player’s Working Area. Then pay any cost
based on the Colonists still there.

It is Blue’s turn, and he wants to take the
Construct a Building action. All the Action
slots are currently full (1 Blue, 1 Purple,
and 1 Yellow). Since it is a tie for the most,
all of the Colonists there are moved back
to their respective players’ Working Areas.
There are now no Colonists on the action,
so Blue does not have to pay anything to
take the action.

It is Green’s turn, and she wants to take the
Upgrade a Building action. All the Action
slots are currently full (2 Purple and 1
Green), so Purple’s Colonists (the player
with the most) are moved back to their
Working Area. The only Colonist left is
Green, so there is no additional cost to take
the action.

ORBITAL STATION MAIN ACTIONS
LANDING POD:
Landings using the pod are slow, painful, expensive, and lonely, but sometimes your best option. Proceed at your own risk!

This action allows you to travel to the Colony.
Follow the rules as described on page 20 for the
Shuttle Phase but skip step 1 (placing a Discovery
tile). After you have chosen a Turn Order space

on the Colony side, lay your Player marker down
to indicate that you have already taken your turn
this round. If the Shuttle travels from Mars to
Orbit this round, you may travel with it as normal.

Note: This action may seem unusual at first. The
use of this action will become clear once you
have played a few rounds.

Yellow wants a Blueprint. Because Purple
already has a Colonist there, this costs

This action allows you to take 1 Blueprint card
from the ones available in the display. These
Blueprints are required for upgrading Buildings
(see page 16) which will provide new Executive
actions. Place the card face up next to your
Player board and gain the Resource or Crystal
depicted in the bottom right of the card.
Finally, place one of your unused Advanced
Building markers on the card. If you do not
have any Advanced Building markers remaining,
you cannot take the Blueprint. Do not draw a
replacement card.

Example of Obtaining a Blueprint:

Note: As long as the Advanced Building marker
is on the card, the depicted action cannot be
used. The marker is removed when you upgrade a
Building using the Blueprint.
Boosted action: For each Colonist you move to
your Working Area when taking this action, you
can take an additional Blueprint, following the
same rules as above.

Example: Learning new Technology

Gained when taking this card
19

Also indicates the type of Building
that can be upgraded.

LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGY:
Technology tiles allow you to perform or enhance certain actions. The more developed
they are, the more powerful they become. Tech tiles are also worth points at the end of
the game.
Take 1 Tech tile from the Tech Grid and place it
on an empty space of the leftmost column in your
Laboratory. If both of these spaces already have
a tile on them, you may not take this action.

Purple chooses to learn a new technology.
He chooses the Water technology, paying 1
Battery as it is in the middle row of the Tech
Grid. He chooses to place it on the bottom
space of column 1 in his Laboratory and gains
the benefit of that space (gaining a Crystal).
10

The cost to take a tile depends on its position
in the Tech Grid. Taking a tile from one of the
bottom spaces is free, taking a tile from one of
the middle spaces costs 1 Battery, and taking
a tile from one of the top three spaces costs 1
Battery and 1 Resource of your choice. Tech tiles
are not refilled until the Colony level increases
(see page 16).

After placing the tile in your Laboratory, you
may immediately gain the benefit shown by
the graphic printed on that space. Some of
these benefits also show a Teal Colonist icon,
meaning that the action can be boosted by using
additional Colonists as normal. See the Reference
book for an explanation of these graphics.
Boosted action: You may move a Colonist to your
Working area when performing this action to take
a second Tech Tile following the same rules as
above.
Note: Each player may only have 1 Tech tile of
each type.

Example: Developing a Technology
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D):

x2 All technological developments are carried out on the Space Station orbiting Mars.
These technologies will be put into good use on the surface of the planet.

This action allows you to develop Tech tiles on
your Player board by moving them to the right.
You may develop 1 Tech tile twice or 2 Tech tiles
once each. If you develop only 1 tile twice, treat
each of the movements separately.
To develop a Tech tile, move it to an adjacent
empty space to the right of the tile’s current
position and pay the cost depicted above the
column to which the tile is moving.
If you move a Tech tile to a space with a graphic
on it, you may immediately gain the benefit of
that space (see Reference book).

USING TECH TILES:
At various times in the game,
such as when performing an
action or gaining a benefit,
if there is a related Tech tile
(with a matching icon) owned by any player, the
effect of that action / benefit can be made more
powerful. The greater the level of the Tech tile,
the more powerful the effect.
Each time you use Tech, you may use any one
Tech tile, belonging to you or another player.

Note: If a development provides you with
Resources, you can use those Resources to pay
for another development.
Note: The number above each column is the
technology level of each tile in that column. At
the end of the game, each of your Tech tiles is
worth OP depicted below the column.
Boosted action: For each Colonist you move
to your Working Area when taking this action,
develop any 1 Tech tile in your Laboratory once.
You may develop the same tile multiple times in
this way, and you may develop a tile even if you
didn’t develop it with the Main action.

If you use another player’s Tech tile, that player
takes 1 Oxygen from the general supply and
places it at the top of their Player board.
At the end of your turn, that player has the
option to immediately develop the Tech tile
that was used, at no cost (including getting the
benefit of a space they move the tile to). If they
do, the Oxygen taken earlier is placed back to
the general supply. If they cannot or
do not wish to develop the Tech tile,
they gain the Oxygen.

Resources from Earth are in short supply and there is limited space in the warehouse.
More resources will arrive as the colony grows.

Boosted action: For each Colonist you move
to your Working Area when taking this action,
take 1 additional Crystal or Resource from the
Warehouse.

She would like to deve lop it more, but t he
two adjace nt spaces are curre nt ly occupie d,
so instead she deve lops he r Ge ne rator Te ch
t ile to leve l 5 by paying t he Mine ral t hat
she just gaine d ( in place of t he Oxyge n)
and a P lant. She moves t he t ile to t he space
de pict ing a Blue print and uses t he be nefit
of t hat space to obtain 1 or more Blue prints.
F inally, she may choose to se nd addit ional
Colonists to he r Working Area to deve lop

do so.

Example of Re supply:

allows he r to take 1 Resource or 1 Crystal.
H oweve r, she boosts
t he act ion by se nding
two Colonists to

t he Ware house.

RESUPPLY:

This action allows you to take any 1 Resource or 1
Crystal from the Warehouse and place it in your
Storage/Depot.

Gre e n chooses t his act ion and places a
Colonist on an Act ion slot. Since t he re
we re no ot he r Colonists on Act ion slots

to take t his act ion. For he r init ial two

moving it to t he space de pict ing a Mine ral
and gaining 1 Mine ral.

She de cides to take 2 Crystals and 1 Wate r.
N ote t hat be cause she only has 1 She lte r
on t he board, he r curre nt storage limit on
Resources is 2.

Reminder: You have limited capacity for storing
Crystals (the number of empty spaces in your
Depot) and Resources (equal to the number of
Shelters you have, plus one).
Note: You cannot take something from the
Warehouse if you do not have the capacity to
store it.

COLONY MAIN ACTIONS
CONTROL CENTER:
x2

The first robotic rover that successfully landed on Mars was Sojourner in July of

x2 1997. Later, the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars in January 2004.

Curiosity landed in 2012 and is still operating. Rovers are responsible for most of
the information and data we have gathered from the surface of the planet.
This action allows you to move your Bots and
your Rover. You have 2 Movement points to use
for moving your Bots and 2 Movement points to
use for moving your Rover. You can do this in any
order. You could move one Bot 1 hex, then your
Rover, then another Bot (or even the same one).
Each Movement point allows you to move the 	
Bot / Rover to an adjacent hex.
Each Crystal you have in your Depot prior
to taking this action may be spent to gain 1
additional Movement point for either your Bots
or your Rover.
Note: Bots and Rovers can pass through, but not
end the turn on, a hex containing an Advanced
Building, Colonist, another Bot, or another Rover.

BOTS:

Bots are cleaners and
builders. If a Bot ends its turn in a
hex with a Discovery or Research tile,
the tile is destroyed and removed
from the game. If a Bot ends the turn
in a hex with a Crystal, return the
Crystal back to the general supply.

The hex the Bot is in
and all adjacent hexes
are classed as that
Bot’s Building Zone.
This is relevant for
constructing and
upgrading Buildings
(pages 13 and 16).

At the start of the game, although the piece
representing your Rover is next to your Player
board, your Rover is actually at the starting Mine
in the center of the board. When you move your
Rover for the first time in the game, first place
your Rover on the starting Mine and then count
hexes from there.

Rovers travel around
the map collecting Crystals by
simply passing over them, or
Discovery tiles and Research tiles
if they end the turn on them.

12

When moving your Rover, you can
increase its range by using the
related Tech tile (see page 11 for
the full rules on using Tech tiles).

Example :

You can also use a Rover Tech tile to gain
additional Movement points equal to the level of
the Tech tile.
You may collect any Crystals on hexes you pass
through or land on. Take them from the board
and place them in the space below your Depot as
if you had gained them (you cannot spend them
this turn).
After you have performed all your movement, if
there is a Discovery or Research tile on the hex
where your Rover is, you may remove that tile
from the board to gain the benefit as long as you
meet the following conditions:

If you use a level-3 Rover Tech tile, you add
3 more Movement points for a total of 5.

•	 You must not have already taken a Research
tile of that color and letter.
•	 You must pay any cost associated with the
benefit.
•	 You must be able to take at least some of the
benefit. If you cannot, your Rover cannot end
its movement on that hex.
If you gain a tile, resolve it immediately by
paying any associated cost, then place it in
your play area (put Discovery tiles face down).
Discovery and Research tiles may be needed to
complete a Mission or a Private Goal.
See the Reference book for a detailed list of the
Discovery and Research tiles.

ROVER:

USING ROVER TECHNOLOGY

A Rove r moves 5 hexes, colle ct ing a
Crystal on t he way and t he n claiming t he
Discove ry t ile.

CONSTRUCT A BUILDING:
Construction of critical Buildings is essential to the development of the Colony and
the arrival of new ships, welcoming more colonists to the planet. Production levels of
power, water, food, and oxygen must be increased to sustain the necessary conditions
for the self-sufficiency of the inhabitants on Mars. Companies that contribute to these
improvements will be rewarded with resources and recognition.
This action allows you to add a new Building on
Mars. You can either place a Building:
a.	 Adjacent to an existing Building of the same
type (creating a Complex - this requires the
use of a Tech tile), or
b.	 Exactly 2 hexes away from an existing Building
of the same type (and not adjacent to another
existing Building of the same type).
Note: Your Shelters and your opponents’
Shelters are considered to be Buildings of
different types.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose which Building you want to construct.
This can be one of the tiles next to the board
(Mine, Generator, Water Extractor, Greenhouse,
Oxygen Condenser) or the Shelter in the
lowest position on your Player board.
2.	Pay the cost as shown on the Building display
board. For Mines, see the bullet points below.
For Shelters, the cost is 1 Oxygen (printed on
the Shelter tiles).
3.	Place the new tile face down (in the same
orientation as other already-placed tiles) on a
hex that currently does not contain a Building
and is within the Building zone of one of your
Bots (on the Bot’s hex, or adjacent to the Bot).

LSS BUILDINGS:
An LSS Building is one of the types which is
critical to the colony. These are depicted in
the LSS area of the game board.

The following rules also apply when Constructing:
•	 The first time in the game
that you create or increase
the size of a Complex, move
your Progress cube from
the bottom of your Player
board for the corresponding
Building and place it on the
slot of your color below the
corresponding building in the
Progress area.

Generator

Greenhouse Oxygen
Water
Extractor
Condenser

DISPLACEMENT RULE:

Note: You only get to move a Progress cube if
you create or increase the size of a Complex
(2 or more connected Buildings of the same
type). Constructing a standalone Building not
connected to another Building of the same type
does not allow you to move a Progress cube.

•	 If you construct or upgrade a Building on
top of a Crystal, return it to the general
supply.

Note: Constructing a Shelter Complex does not
allow you to move a Progress cube.

•	 If you construct or upgrade a Building on
top of a Bot or Rover, that piece must be
moved away from its current position by its
owner to the closest available hex (either
an empty hex or a Building with no other
piece on it).

PROGRESS AREA:
In the bottom right of the main board is the
Progress area. Progress cubes placed in this
area will score points during the first and
second Colony upgrade (see sidebar, page 16),
and at the end of the game.

•	 If you construct or upgrade a Building on
top of a Discovery or Research tile, return it
to the game box.

•	 If you placed a Building adjacent to one or
more Buildings of the same type (creating
or increasing the size of a Complex), you
must use a Tech tile of the related type and
level (see page 14).
•	 If you placed a tile exactly 2 hexes away
from a Building of the same type, no Tech
tile is needed. This does not count as
creating a Complex.
4.	If the Building tile you placed has
arrows on it, place 1 Crystal from
the general supply in each adjacent
empty hex that the arrows are
pointing to. Then, flip the tile face up,
ensuring the correct orientation is maintained.
5.	Gain a number of Resources matching the
type of Building equal to the new size of the
Complex (i.e. the number of contiguous hexes
consisting of tiles matching the tile you just
placed). If the Building you placed is not
adjacent to any other Buildings of the same
type, gain 1 Resource.
If you placed a Shelter, gain Crystals instead
of Resources.

MARS
CONSTRUCTION
CYCLE

•	 If you placed a Mine, you must
place 1 Colonist from your Living
Quarters onto the Mine. If you
do not have any Colonists in
your Living Quarters, you cannot
build a Mine. That Colonist is now
considered a Miner and will produce Minerals
when you travel to Orbit (see page 20).
•	 If you constructed an LSS Building, move the
corresponding marker on the LSS track up by
1 space, if able. This may trigger LSS Rewards
(see page 15).

Building Shelters for Colonists to live
in requires Oxygen, generating Oxygen
requires Plants, growing Plants requires
Water, extracting Water requires Power,
generating Power requires mining Minerals,
and mining Minerals requires Colonists.

Example of Constructing:
USING TECHNOLOGY TO CONSTRUCT:
If you construct a Building which creates or
increases the size of a Complex (i.e. you are
placing a Building adjacent to a Building of
the same type), you must use a related Tech
tile. e.g. To place a Greenhouse adjacent
to another Greenhouse, you need to use a
Greenhouse Tech tile.

The level of the Tech tile used must be
equal to or greater than the total number
of Buildings that you are connecting to. If
connecting to an existing complex of Buildings,
each Building in that Complex counts as 1
Building, even if the Building is not directly
connected to the new Building. See page 11 for
the full rules on using Tech tiles.

The Oxygen marker in the LSS is moved up to
show that there are now 2 Oxygen Condensers
on Mars. This triggers LSS rewards, which are
described on the next page.

Constructing a Water
Extractor next to another
single Water Extractor
requires the use of a Water
Tech tile which is at least
level 1 because you are
connecting to 1 other
Wate r E xt ractor.

MINES:
Resource mining will be one of
the most lucrative industries
on Mars. Private companies
will compete for the rights
to mine the most profitable
regions of the planet.
Mines work in a few different ways. They are not
part of the LSS and the Minerals they produce
cannot be acquired from the Warehouse. Mines
are built in the same way as other Buildings,
but instead of paying a Resource to place the
tile, you must place 1 Colonist from your Living
Quarters on the Mine after it has been placed.
If you do not have a Colonist in your Living
Quarters, you cannot build the Mine.

E xample: Co ns t ruc t i ng a Mi ne

Yellow wants to build a new M ine. The M ine
Tec h tile is not cur rently in play, so s he
cannot c reate a M ine Co mplex.
To do so, she places one of he r Colonists
f rom he r Living Quar te rs onto t he Mine.
The B ot is displace d to a nearby hex.

In addition to the Minerals received from placing
a Mine, each of your Colonists on a Mine also
produces 1 Mineral every time you travel to Orbit
(see page 20).
Creating or Increasing the size of a Mine Complex
allows you to place your Progress cube in the
Progress area as normal.
Even if a Colonist is working in a Mine, the
mine is not owned by any player. Therefore, any
player may upgrade a mine with another player’s
Colonist on it (see page 16).

She gains 1
Mine ral.

Instead, she constructs a new standalone Mine.

LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM (LSS)
The row occupied by the Colony level marker represents the current needs of
the colony. At the start of the game, there is one of each Building on the map
and the colony wants two of everything. Players who help meet that need (by
placing the appropriate Building tile) will gain a bonus. However, advancing
the marker further before the Colony level marker has advanced will not give
you a bonus because the colony does not need that type of Building right now.
The LSS represents the essential buildings
needed to maintain survival on Mars and allow
more Colonists to arrive. It also shows the
current Colony level, which is the row below
where the Colony level marker is. At the start of
the game, the marker is on the second row, so
the Colony level is 1.
Each column represents a subsystem of the LSS
and tracks the number of constructed Buildings
of the corresponding type on the map. Each
time a Building tile is placed on the board, move
the marker in its column 1 space up, unless it is
already at the top of the column.
The first time an LSS Building of each type is
built (i.e. moving the marker from the bottom
row to the next row up), the player who built that
Building scores 2 OP.
Also, if the marker was below the row where
the Colony level marker is before it was moved,

LSS Re war d e xample s

the player who advances the marker gains two
additional benefits:
1.	 OP according to the
LSS Reward tile at the
top of the column the
marker is in. Do not
remove the LSS tile.

A Power Generator is constructed. Since the
marker was below the Colony level marker
before construction, LSS rewards apply.

2.	One of the benefits shown 				
in the top-left of the LSS.
The LSS Reward tiles and other benefits are all
explained in the Reference book.

The current Colony level also determines the
frequency of travel of the Shuttle. See next
page for a full explanation of this.

Another Power Generator is constructed. 	
No LSS rewards apply because the marker
was not below the Colony level marker.
15

Example: Colony Level increase

COLONY STATUS UPDATE
Whenever all of the markers advance to the row
with the Colony level marker (or higher), the
Colony Status is updated at the end of your turn.
Follow these steps:

4.	Refill the Warehouse with Crystals and
Resources from the general supply until there
are 3 of each.
Note: In a 2-player game, refill only 2 of each.

1.	 Move the Colony level marker up one row.
2.	New Blueprint cards may be added to the
display.
A G re e n hou se i s co n stru cted a n d th ere are

Col o ny i nc rea ses to Level 2 !

Example of Progress area scoring:

•	 If the colony has just reached Lvl 2, remove
all remaining Blueprints from the display
(place them back in the box) add the top 12
cards from the Blueprint deck to the display
(this will be the remaining 6 Lvl 1 cards and
6 Lvl 3 cards.)
•	 If the colony has just reached Lvl 3, remove
all Lvl 1 Blueprints from the display (place
them back in the box) add the remaining 6
Lvl 3 cards from the deck to the display.
3.	Refill any empty spaces in the Tech Grid with
new Tech tiles from the stack (fill spaces from
bottom to top).
Note: Skip this step in a 2-player game.

5.	The first two times the
Colony Status is updated
each player gains
1/2/4/7/11 points for having
1/2/3/4/5 cubes in the
Progress area.

6.	If the Colony Level is
now at 3 or higher, move
the Remaining Missions
marker one space to the
right (see page 19). If the Remaining Missions
marker was already on space 1, the end of the
game is triggered.

The only way to have a self-sustaining colony on Mars is by upgrading the basic
buildings to advanced ones using the latest terrestrial and Martian technology.

This action allows you to use a Blueprint you
have previously taken to upgrade one of the
Buildings on the map into an Advanced Building.

1.	 Choose a Blueprint and matching Building.

•	 Each Blueprint can only be used once.

2.	Pay 1 Mineral to the general supply.

The icon in the top-center of the blueprint
indicates the minimum size of building that can
be upgraded. The icon in the bottom indicates
the type.
A level-1 Blueprint can be used to upgrade any of
the corresponding Buildings.
A level-3 Blueprint can be used to upgrade a
corresponding Building as long as it is part of a
Complex of size 3 or greater.

16

To upgrade, follow these steps:

•	 Each Building can only be upgraded once.
Advanced Buildings produce Resources when you
travel to Orbit and also have a special action
which can be used as an Executive action (see
page 18).

G re e n moves t h e Ad va n ced B u i l d i n g m a rker
f rom t he Bl u ep ri nt o nto th e Bu i l d i n g .

a Shelter, you can only upgrade one of your
Shelters, not one belonging to another player.

To upgrade a Building, it must be in the Building
zone of one of your Bots. Also, when upgrading

3.	Take your Advanced Building marker from the
Blueprint and place it on the Building tile that
you are upgrading.
•	 If there was a Bot or Rover on the tile,
follow the Displacement rule on page 13.
•	 If there was a Colonist on the tile, move
that Colonist back to the owner’s Living
Quarters. If there is not enough space for
them, return them to that player’s supply.
If you use an Upgrade Tech tile
(yours or another player’s) when
performing this action, you may
repeat this process up to a number
of times equal to the level of the
Tech tile used. I.e. if you use a level 2 tech, you
may perform up to 3 upgrades.

Example of We lcomin g a Sh ip:

WELCOME A SHIP:
Once sustainable conditions are created on the colony, new ships arrive with the next
generation of colonists and machines to help the colony expansion.

This action allows you to move any 1 of your
Private Ships from your Depot to your Hangar. The
cost of doing this is 1 Plant and 1 Water (there is a
reminder of this to the left of your Depot).
When you do this, gain either:
•	 1 Colonist and 1 Bot, or
•	 2 Colonists.
Place new Colonists in empty spaces in your
Living Quarters, if able.
Place a new Bot on one of your Shelters that
is currently empty. If none of your Shelters are
empty, place the Bot on the closest available
empty space to one of your Shelters.

Boosted action: For each Colonist you move
to your Working Area when taking this action,
move 1 additional Ship. You must pay 1 Water and
1 Plant for, and receive the benefits from, each
ship as normal.
Note: You cannot boost this action with Colonists
you just gained this turn.

The Colony leve l is curre nt ly 3. You have
previously we lcome d 2 Ships, one of which
you discarde d to t rave l, leaving you 1 Ship
in your H angar. If you choose t his act ion
again, you can only we lcome 1 new Ship
(you cannot boost t he Act ion) , since you
have already take n 2 Ships f rom your
De pot, and t he limit is curre nt ly 3.

The number of ships in total that can be
removed from your Depot is equal to the current
Colony level.
Ships in your Hangar are worth points at the end
of the game, but you can discard one during the
Shuttle phase to travel (see page 19).

EARTH CONTRACTS
Cost to take: 1 Crystal.

HIRE A SCIENTIST OR TAKE AN EARTH CONTRACT:
It’s a mistake to try to build a sustainable colony on a distant planet without any
scientists. The knowledge and study of the unknown is in their hands. In fact, these will
be the leaders of all expeditions on Earth or on any distant planet.

At the start of the game, only the 6 Scientists
are available in the display. As they get taken,
they will be replaced by Contract cards.
This action has only one available slot per player.
You can not take this action if you already have
a Colonist there. You still pay any additional cost
to take this action based on Colonists of other
colors on Action slots.

If you complete a Contract at the end of the
game, gain the OP depicted. If you fail to
complete it, you lose the OP depicted instead.
There are two types of Contract:

1.	 Choose a card on the display and pay the
indicated cost as depicted on the display
board. (The cost to take the Geologist is
moving 2 Colonists from your Living Quarters
to your Working Area.)
2.	Take the card and place it face up in front
of you. If you took a Scientist, also take the
Scientist marker on the card.
3.	At the end of your turn, refill the slot on the
display with a Contract card of your choice.
You may freely look through them and choose
the one you want. Place the Contract on the
lower half of the space (covering over the old
Scientist cost, and leaving the Crystal on the
space visible).

Note: Unlike other actions, these Action slots do
not clear when they are all full. You must retrieve
your Colonists by other means (such as when you
travel — see page 20).

Delivery Contracts: 	
Once you have one of
these contracts, you
may move Crystals and
Resources of the depicted
types from your Player
board onto the Contract at
any time during the game.

Anything you gain that is required by the
Contract can be placed directly on the card,
bypassing your Player board. To complete this
Contract, all of the depicted items must be
on the card at the end of the game. Minerals
cannot be used as another type of Resource for
completing a Contract.

Upgrade Contracts: 	
To complete this type of
Contract, at the end of
the game you must have
an Advanced building

the depicted type that is
part of a Complex of at
least size 4.

Scientists are explained on the next page.
17

MARS CRYSTALS (MARSINUM):
At the start of the game, you have space in
your Depot to store 3 Crystals. This can be
increased by Welcoming new Ships. Crystals
are needed to pay for Executive actions.
Reminder: Any Crystals gained are placed in
the space below your Depot; you cannot spend
them on the turn you gain them.

The main use of Marsinum is to power up Bots and Rovers, but it is also used to trade favors. These Crystals are slowly becoming
very valuable on Mars. I chose to create these crystals as a game currency because I believe no money will be used during the
first 100 years of Mars colonization. I like to imagine a power that has not been discovered until we reach another planet, and this
is the story that I would like to tell in this game.
If you prefer a more realistic approach, the crystals can represent Uranium, a very radioactive heavy metal, which has been used
as a source of concentrated energy and was already found on Mars. It’s rare, powerful, and can easily be traded.

EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
Once per turn, before or after your Main action,
you may perform one of the Executive actions
available to you.

Each action has a cost in Crystals associated with
it, and you must pay that amount of Crystals to
perform the action.

Your Executive actions are shown next to the slots
in your Depot. An action is available to you as
long as you do not have a ship on that space (i.e.
at the start of the game, you only have access to
the bottom 3 Executive actions in your Depot).

The different Executive actions are described in
the Reference book.

CONCENTRATOR

Ex a m p l e : E x e c u t i ve a c t i o n s

Marsinum is a new crystal being found on Mars for the first time. It is made up of radioactive isotopes forming a crystal structure,
never seen before. Its structure allows it to concentrate huge amounts of energy in its crystal lattice, making it not only
radioactive but highly unstable as well and thus very dangerous. However, if handled appropriately, it constitutes a great source
of energy never seen before.

BOOSTING TECH
WITH COLONISTS
Some Advanced Building
actions depict the Teal
Colonist icon at the
bottom. This means that
you may send Colonists
to your Working Area to
temporarily add to the
level of the tech when
taking the action.

For e xample :
You are activating the Executive action
of the Concentrator. This allows you to
construct a Oxygen Condenser. You want
to increase the size of an existing Oxygen
Condenser Complex from size 3 to size 4.
This requires a Tech tile of level 3 but you
only have a related Tech tile of level 2. You
move 1 Colonist from your Living Quar ters
to your Working Area to count as the level
you are missing.

One of the Executive actions is
to use one of your own Advanced
Buildings at a cost of 2 Crystals.
However, if you have a Scientist,
you can put them to work in an
Advanced Building that matches their specialty,
even a Building belonging to another player.
To do this, move the Scientist marker from
wherever it currently is to the Blueprint card
you wish to use, and then proceed with the
appropriate Executive action.

As long as a Scientist is working in a Building,
both the owner of the Scientist and the owner of
the Building may perform the Executive action of
that Building at no cost.
A Scientist must stay working in a building until
they are moved out to work in another Building.
Scientists also grant OP at the end of the game
based on the number of Advanced Buildings on
Mars of the indicated type.

MISSIONS

M iss io ns are sent fro m Ear th w hic h deter mine
the most impo r tant steps of co lo nizatio n.

During Setup, 3 Mission cards
are placed on the board.
Each Mission card depicts an
objective for the colony. If you
contribute to that objective,
gain the Crystals shown on the card for each
contribution and place them below your Depot.
Also, move the Mission tracker cube down 1 space.
Once the requirements of the Mission are fully met
(the cube reaches the space with the checkmark),
remove the card from the game and move the
Remaining Missions marker 1 space to the right.

Once a total of 3 Missions have been completed
collectively by all players, the end of the game is
triggered (see page 21).
Note: The number of Missions required to trigger
the end of the game can be reduced based on the
Colony Level (see sidebar).

See the reference book for details of the Missions.

PRIVATE GOALS

At Colony level 4, the number
of completed Missions
required to end the game is 1.

Eac h co mpany has its ow n pr io r ities.

You start the game with 3
Private Goal cards, each of
which depicts the requirements
necessary to complete it. Each
Private Goal is fully explained
in the Reference book.
During your turn in the Colonization phase, if at
any point you meet the requirements of the card,
you may complete the Goal by placing it face up
next to your player board and taking one of the
rewards depicted.

If the Colony reaches level 3, the
number of completed Missions
required to end the game is 2.

Each player can only complete one Private Goal
during the game.

At Colony level 5, the end of the
game is triggered, even if no
Missions have been completed.

Also, on your turn, you may discard a Private
Goal from your hand (return it unseen to the box)
and use it as if it were a Crystal. You may do this
before and after completing your Private Goal
(or, do not complete any Goal, and use all the
cards as Crystals).

In each case, advance the Remaining Missions
marker one space to track how many more are
still needed.

Note: You discard the card and use it as if it
were a Crystal. You do not discard the card and
take a Crystal.

SHUTTLE PHASE
At the start of this phase, move the Shuttle one
space towards the middle of the board following
the arrows. If the Shuttle is already on the red
Travel space closest to the middle of the board, it
travels instead.
If the Shuttle travels, move it to the Travel space
on the opposite side indicated by the current
Colony level.
As the colony starts to become more and more
self-sustained and less dependent on Earth’s
resources, the frequency of the shuttle is reduced.

If you decide not to travel, stand your player
marker back up. You do not get the bonus of the
Turn Order space again.

If you decide to travel, follow the steps described
on the next page:

S hut t le P has e E xample:
The Colony level is currently 2 and the Shuttle
is currently on Travel space 1 on the Orbit side.

Then in turn order, all players decide if they will
travel or not. All players may travel in this phase,
whether the Shuttle itself traveled or not.
If the Shuttle travels, and your Player marker is
on the side that the Shuttle moved from, you can
catch a lift with the Shuttle and travel for free.
Otherwise, you may still travel, but to do so, you
must remove a ship from your Hangar (place it
back in the game box).

In the Shuttle phase, the Shuttle travels and is
placed on Travel space 2 of the Colony side.

Example: Placing a Discovery tile

TRAVEL TO THE COLONY
1.	 Move your Player marker
to the Exploration space.
a.	 Place 1 of the face up Discovery tiles that
is on the Exploration space on an empty
hex exactly 3 spaces away from your Rover.
If your Rover is not yet on the map, it is
counted as being at the starting Mine in the
center of the board. If there is no available
hex for you to place the tile, it does not get
placed, skip step b.

These a re t h e p oss i b l e h exes fo r a
D i scove r y t i l e to b e p l a ced by Pu rp l e.

b.	Replace the tile with a new one from the
top of the stack, face up.

Note: When returning Colonists to your Living
Quarters, if there are not enough slots for
them, return any excess to your personal
supply next to your Player board.
3.	Move your Player marker to any empty Turn
Order space on the Colony side.
You may gain the bonus printed on the space
(see the Reference book). If the bonus triggers
another bonus, gain it also. However, if any
bonus has a cost associated with it, that cost
must be paid in order to receive the bonus.

2.	Move your Player marker to the
Retrieve Colonists space.
a.	 Move all of your Colonists
from Action slots on the Colony side of the
board back to your Living Quarters (If you
started the game on the Orbit side, the first
time you travel to the Colony, you will not
have any Colonists there).
b.	Move all Colonists in your Working Area
back to your Living Quarters.

TRAVEL TO ORBIT
1.	 Move your Player marker to the
Production space.

Example: Production

Each of your Advanced Buildings on Mars
produces 1 Resource corresponding to the
type of building. Each Advanced Building you
have on a Shelter produces a Crystal, and each
of your Colonists/Advanced Buildings on the
mines will produce 1 Mineral.
2.	Move your Player marker to the
Retrieve Colonists space.
a.	 Move all of your Colonists from the Orbit
side of the board back to your Living
Quarters.

Wh e n Ye l l ow travel s to O rb i t, h er Mi n e
a nd Powe r G e n era to r p ro d u ce. S h e g a i n s 1
M i ne ra l a n d 1 B a ttery.
20

b.	Move all Colonists in your Working Area
back to your Living Quarters.

Note: When returning Colonists to your Living
Quarters, if there are not enough slots for
them, return any excess to your personal
supply next to your Player board.
3.	Move your Player marker to any empty Turn
Order space on the Orbit side.
You may gain the bonus printed on the space
(see the Reference book). If the bonus triggers
another bonus, gain it also. However, if any
bonus has a cost associated with it, that cost
must be paid in order to receive the bonus.

END OF THE GAME
At the end of the Colonization phase, if the
Remaining Missions marker has reached the end
of its track (which may be caused by completing
3 missions, progressing the colony to a high
level, or a combination of both), the end of the
game is triggered.

1/2/4/7/11 OP for having 1/2/3/4/5 Progress
cubes in the Progress area, as you did
when advancing the colony level.

Each Scientist scores 3 OP for each
Advanced Building of the indicated types
on Mars, no matter who owns it.

3 OP for each ship you have in your
Hangar.

Gain or lose OP for each Earth Contract
card as depicted on the card based on
whether you completed it or not. (You may
transfer any Resources or Crystals to any
contracts at this time.)

Return all Colonists from the side of
the board where your Player marker is,
and from your Working Area, back to
your Living Quarters. Slots in the Living
Quarters must be filled from bottom to
top. If there is not enough space, place the
excess in your personal supply. You score
OP according to the indicated number next
to your highest located Colonist.
When the end of the game is triggered, play until
the end of the current round, and then play 1 more
round. Skip the Shuttle phase in the final round.
Each player moves any Crystals they gained in the
last round into their Depot as normal.
Then calculate each player’s score as follows:

Each Tech tile in your Laboratory is worth
a number of OP indicated below the column
it is in.
OP for Advanced Buildings, 3 points for Lvl
1 card and 5 points for Lvl 3 cards. Lose 3
points for every unbuilt Lvl 1 Blueprint and
5 points for every unbuilt Lvl 3 Blueprint.

After adding end-game scoring to points scored
during the game, the player with the most
Opportunity Points is declared the winner.
	
In the case of a tie, the player with the most
Crystals is the winner. If there is still a tie, the
player with the most advanced buildings is the
winner. If there is still a tie, the player with the
most Progress cubes in the Progress area is the
winner. If there is still a tie, tied players share
the victory.

SOLO GAME
In the solo game, you will be competing directly
with one opponent: Lacerda.
To win the game, you must fulfill all the
requirments of any one of the goals shown on
the following page.
Play with the general game rules for 2 players
with the following exceptions:

SETUP
Choose a color for yourself and another for
Lacerda’s company. Setup both Player boards
and the main board as for a 2-player game with
two exceptions:

•	 When Lacerda builds a LSS building, if he has a
Colonist on the Hire a Scientists action slot, he
chooses the reward of retrieving that Colonist.
If he does not have a Colonist there, he gains a
Crystal instead.

SHUTTLE PHASE
•	 Lacerda always chooses to travel
with the Shuttle unless the most
recent solo card depicts an X next
to the cube in the top of the card,
in which case he does not travel.

2

When Lacerda travels, choose an available Turn
Order space at random. Resolve the travel as
normal, but with the following changes:

•	 When traveling to Orbit, Lacerda skips both steps.

•	 When Lacerda scores this tile, treat his
Living Quarters as if it is full of Colonists.
•	 Lacerda always uses Tech if it is
available. You get an Oxygen as normal if he
uses your Tech.
•	 When he moves his Bot, move it to the next icon
in the LSS sequence (Mine > Generator > Water
Extractor > Greenhouse > Oxygen Condenser >
back to Mine, etc.).

•	 Lacerda does not get any Private Goal cards.
•	 Instead of placing Lacerda’s Bot on his
Shelter, place it on the icon of the Mine in the
Progress Area.
In addition, shuffle the solo deck and place it
face down nearby.
Shuffle the First Colonists tiles and
choose one at random. This is the
starting Turn Order space for Lacerda.
Then, choose a Turn Order space for
yourself (or use a random one), gaining
the benefit as usual. The Shuttle starts in
the red space on the same side as Lacerda.

•	 When traveling to the Colony, Lacerda
places a Discovery tile but skips the retrieve
Colonists step.
•	 When placing a Discovery tile, Lacerda always
places the leftmost Discovery tile from the
Exploration space. It is placed 3 spaces away
from his Rover as far away as possible from your
Rover as possible. When Lacerda travels to the
Colony, after choosing a Turn Order space, he
constructs a Building, following the same rules
as Action 1 - Construct a Building (see below).

Lacerda takes whatever there is the most
of. In case of a tie, he takes the leftmost
one (Crystals first). Any Resources taken
are placed into the general supply.
Lacerda takes a Tech tile as as described
under LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGY action
on the next page.
Since Lacerda always has all the
Colonists he needs, instead he moves his
Rover (see below).
x2 Move Lacerda’s Bot using the rules

COLONIZATION PHASE

described above.

On Lacerda’s turn, reveal the top card from the
solo deck. He performs an action (detailed below)
and then the card is discarded.
When the solo deck is empty, the next time Lacerda
takes a turn, reshuffle the discarded cards to make
a new deck and then reveal the top one as normal.
After you have shuffled the deck once (the 2nd
time through the deck), in addition to Lacerda
performing the action, also move the indicated
Mission tracker cube down one space. He gets
Crystals for contributing to the Mission as usual.

Lacerda takes a Blueprint as described
under OBTAIN BLUEPRINT action on the
next page.

Lacerda places a Discover y tile.

EXTRA RULES FOR LACERDA
•	 Lacerda always has as many Colonists as he
needs. At the end of the game, all spaces in
his Living Quarters are considered occupied
for scoring.
•	 Lacerda does not take any Executive actions.

Mission marker to move

Lacerda’s action

2

•	 When the Colony levels up, at the end of the
current player’s turn, Lacerda builds a Shelter
(a Complex if possible) and Welcomes a new
Ship. He never spends his own Ships, just
keeps them to score.
•	 Lacerda never collects or stores resources. He
never pays Resources to take any action.
•	 Lacerda gains Crystals as normal (Constructing
Shelters, taking a Shelter Blueprint, contributing
to a Mission, etc.). The number of Crystals he
can store is limited to spaces in his Depot.

22

TURN ORDER SPACE BENEFITS

COLONIST PLACEMENT COST AND ILLEGAL MOVES
Lacerda always has to place a Colonist on actions
that depict a Red Colonist. He pays the additional
cost with Crystals, he cannot pay with Colonists.
If he does not have enough Crystals to pay, or
if the move he is doing is not allowed for some
reason (no space in his Lab to learn more Techs,
no Blueprints available, Scientist slot is already
occupied, etc.), then instead of performing the
action, he moves his Rover instead.

MOVING LACERDA’S ROVER
Whenever Lacerda moves his Rover, it moves
toward the closest tile (either Research or
Discovery) that it can collect. Do not count any
Discovery tiles that give Resources as they are
useless to Lacerda. If tied, check the Resolving
Ambiguities rules. He uses any available Tech
and spends additional Crystals if required. If he
reaches a tile, it is resolved immediately.

ORBIT SIDE - LACERDA’S ACTIONS
The number in the Astronaut image
indicates the action that Lacerda will take.

1

ACTION 1. OBTAIN BLUEPRINT:
Take the Blueprint of a type that scores
Lacerda’s Scientists. If tied, take the
leftmost card from the row with the most
cards in it (bottom row if tied).

ACTION 2. LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGY:
Lacerda takes the cheapest one, leftmost if
there are more than one. Place it in Lacerda’s
laboratory, top space first, taking benefit as
normal (see above for Warehouse priority).
x2

ACTION 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D):
Lacerda develops the most-developed Tech
that can be developed once, then the leastdeveloped Tech that can be developed
once. If two Techs are tied, develop the
bottom one.

RESUPPLY:
Lacerda only takes this action in the Shuttle
Phase when his astronaut is placed on the
Resupply space of the turn order track, or by
placing a Tech tile on the appropriate space
of his Lab.

LANDING POD:
He never takes it.

COLONY SIDE - LACERDA’S ACTIONS
ACTION 1. CONSTRUCT A BUILDING:
Lacerda always builds the Building
corresponding to the icon his Bot is
on, but only if the LSS marker for that
Building is below the Colony level marker.
If his Bot is on the icon for a Building
whose marker is above the current Colony
level, he builds the next Building in the
sequence, unless that Building’s marker is
above the current Colony level, and so on.
He always constructs a Mine if that is next
in the sequence.

If there is more than one Blueprint to
upgrade, he gives preference to the one that
increases the OP provided by his Scientists.

ACTION 2. UPGRADE A BUILDING:
Lacerda uses one of his Blueprints and
upgrades a Building anywhere on the board.
If the Upgrade Tech is in play, he uses it if
able to upgrade as many Buildings as he can.

These are the goals of the game:

ACTION 3. HIRE A SCIENTIST OR TAKE AN
EARTH CONTRACT:
Lacerda hires the Scientist that will score
him the most potential OP based on the
number of Blueprints owned by each player
(whether used to upgrade yet or not). Once
he has two Scientists, he takes a Contract
instead (the one worth the most OP). His
Contracts are considered automatically
completed. After taking the Scientist
or Contract card, Lacerda shuffles the
Contract deck and refills the display with
the top card.

COLONY LEVELS UP
Every time this happens, Lacerda places a Shelter
according to the construction rules above, then
he takes 1 Bot which is placed on his Player
board. It is never placed on the main board, but it
counts towards LSS Rewards or Missions.

lvl 1 - First Colonists
•	 Reach at least Colony level 3
•	 Complete at least 1 Contract
•	 Complete 1 Private Goal card
•	 Have a level 6 Tech tile
•	 Have more OP than Lacerda

lvl 2 - Next Generation
•	 Reach at least Colony level 3
•	 Complete at least 2 Contracts, 1 of each type
•	 Complete 1 Private Goal card
•	 Have at least 2 Research tiles
•	 Have at least 4 Shelters built
•	 Beat Lacerda by 10 OP or more

RESOLVING AMBIGUITIES

lvl 3 - Hunky Dory

During the game, there will be times when
Lacerda has more than one choice. In these
cases, you must always choose the option
which gives the most advantage to Lacerda.
If there isn’t a clear choice, give a number to
each of the choices and draw cards from the
solo deck until one of those numbers shows
up and then choose that option. Then shuffle
the cards into the deck.

•	 Reach at least Colony level 4
•	 Complete at least 2 Contracts, 1 of each type
•	 Complete 1 Private Goal card
•	 Have Colonists and/or Advanced Building
markers on at least 3 Mines
•	 Have at least 5 Advanced Buildings
•	 Beat Lacerda by 20 OP or more

A Martian Potato survival scenario
Co ns t ruc t i ng example

•	 Reach at least Colony level 3
•	 Complete the size 4 Greenhouse Contract
•	 Complete the Delivery Contract with Plants
and Minerals (#11)
•	 Take the Biochemist

When constructing, Lacerda always tries
to build the largest Complex possible using
any available Tech. If there is more than
one legal Building placement, check the
Resolving Ambiguities rules.
After constructing, move his Bot to
the next icon in the sequence after the
Building that was just constructed.

SOLO GOALS

•	 Have at least 3 Greenhouse advanced
buildings
•	 Expand a Greenhouse Complex to at least
size 5
•	 Have at least 5 Plants in storage
His Bot is o n the Plant ico n. However,
the Co lo ny is at level 1 and there are
already 2 G reenho uses o n the board, so
he co ns iders co nstr uc ting an Oxygen
Co ndenser instead. However, there are
also already 2 of those on the map, so he
constructs a Mine.

•	 Take at least 2 Research tiles
•	 Have the Greenhouse Tech at level 6
•	 Finish the game in Orbit
•	 Beat Lacerda by 30 OP or more

2-PLAYER GAME

FIRST COLONISTS VARIANT

1.	 During setup, place only 2 Crystals and 2 of
each Resource in the Warehouse.

When playing for the first time, it is
recommended to use the 3 Mission cards shown
below, the First Colonist tiles, and the First
Colonist cards.

2.	During setup, return the 8 remaining tech
tiles to the box.
3.	Check page 6 for the starting layout of
Shelters.
4.	The additional cost to place a Colonist on an
Action slot is equal to the number of Colonists
already on Action slots for the chosen action
(of both you and your opponent).
5.	Skip the refill of the Tech Grid since there
aren’t any more tiles to do so.
6.	When refilling the Warehouse with Crystals
and Resources from the general supply, add
up to 2 of each.

1.	 Use the following Mission cards:

The Mission markers should be placed on the
following actions: Obtain a Blueprint, Hire a
Scientist, and Control Center.
2.	 First Colonist tiles: Instead of choosing a Turn
Order space, shuffle the tiles and give each
player one of them at random. Players then
place their Player marker on the indicated Turn
Order space and receive the benefit of that
space (as described in the Reference book).

3.	 First Colonist cards: During setup,
A
shuffle the ‘A’ cards and deal each
player one at random which they
keep secret from the other players.
Return any remaining ones to the
box. Shuffle the ‘B’ cards and place
them face down nearby. Each ‘A’
card depicts 4 types of Building. As soon as you
construct any one of the Buildings depicted on
your card you reveal the card, return it to the
game box, and then draw the top 2 cards from
the ‘B’ deck which you keep secret.

B

12

Each ‘B’ card depicts a task. If you
complete that task, reveal it, gain
the reward depicted, and then return
the card to the box. You can only
complete one task each turn.

Example: Obtain a Blueprint, gain a Crystal.

SPACE ODDITY VARIANT
In this variant, when the end of the game is
triggered, play only until the end of the current
Colonization phase. Be aware that if the last
player to take a turn in the Colonization phase
triggers the end of the game, the game will end
immediately after that player’s turn.

On Mars, most of the humans will be decision makers, scientists, politicians, poets, philosophers, or artists.
They mostly have intellectual jobs leaving the physical work to machines. Any physical activity they may have
will be purely for pleasure and good health, like sports or exercise.
Radiation, cold, and lack of oxygen will keep them inside shelters.
