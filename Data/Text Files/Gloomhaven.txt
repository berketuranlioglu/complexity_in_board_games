Gloomhaven is a cooperative game of battling monsters and advancing a player’s own individual goals. The
game is meant to be played as part of a campaign, where a group of players will use the accompanying Scenario
Book to string together a series of adventures, unlocking new content for the game as they progress. Any
revealed scenario, however, can also function as a highly variable stand-alone experience.
This rule book is split into two parts: The first part will teach you how to play through an individual scenario,
interacting with monsters and the environment using character ability cards. The second will teach you how to
use the Scenario Book to link a series of adventures together to create a story of your own choosing, advancing
your character’s abilities and unlocking new content to further enhance your experience.

Character Mats
When a player begins their journey with the game, he or she will select one of the available character classes
to play. Only one copy of each character class can be played in any given scenario. Each class has a unique set
of abilities, so this is an important decision to make. When the box is first opened, the Brute  , Tinkerer   ,
Spellweaver  , Scoundrel  , Cragheart  , and Mindthief   are available.
Once a character class has been chosen, the player takes the corresponding character mat, character tokens,
and that character’s starting hand of Level 1 ability cards from the larger tuck box containing the character’s
symbol, as well as the miniature contained in the smaller character tuck box.

umans are by far the most dominant of the races,
spreading across the continent like locusts, erecting
extravagant cities and disturbing slumbering forces they
can never hope to understand. The human society is one
of rules and regulations, but also one of great diversity.
Due to their intense curiosity and relentless nature,
humans can find themselves walking almost any path
imaginable – from the obscenely wealthy noble to the
unappreciated tavern cook; from the blacksmith forging
rugged weaponry to the corrupted pursuant of dark
magics.
It is natural, then, that while many humans work to build
up complex and constricting bureaucratic societies,
there are others who reject such societies or even work
to tear them down. Scoundrels are among this second
type, wholly unscrupulous and self-serving. Scoundrels
operate under the assumption that everything in the
world is theirs to take and they will do whatever is
necessary to do the taking. Such an attitude manifests
itself in combat through a vicious opportunism unseen
in any other culture.

Character Ability Cards
Playing ability cards is what allows a character to perform actions in a scenario. Each round players choose
two ability cards and use the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other card, resulting in two
actions for each player on his or her turn. All ability cards are specific to a character class and are acquired
when starting a new character or by leveling up.

Item Cards
Item cards are acquired by spending gold in between scenarios or looting specific treasure tiles. All item cards
a character equips will be placed below his or her character mat and can be used during a battle to augment
his or her abilities. Item cards are not class-specific, so any character can use any item. However, characters
are limited in the number of items they can equip (bring into a scenario). Each character can equip only
one  item, one  item, one   item, up to two  items OR one  item, and up to a number of  equal to
half their level, rounded up. Characters cannot own more than one copy of any item card.

Sometimes an item is used multiple times before it is
spent or consumed. This is depicted by use slots  on

the card and can be tracked using a character token.
o	 This symbol  (not pictured) means the item is
consumed after use, which is shown by flipping the
card facedown. Consumed cards can only be refreshed
during a scenario by specific abilities. All items
are refreshed between scenarios. No item can be
permanently consumed.
o	 If a card depicts neither of these symbols, there are
no restrictions on the number of times it can be used
during a scenario, other than what is written in the text
of the card.

Monster statistic cards give easy access to the base statistics of a given
monster type for both its normal and elite variants. A monster’s base
statistics will vary depending on the scenario level (see Scenario Level
on p. 15 for details). Each edge of the cards, on both sides, reflects the
statistics for a given scenario level. Rotate or flip the card to show the
required level.

Monster Ability Cards
Each round, after players have selected their own ability cards, one card is played for each monster type

increasing its numerical value.

Scenario Setup
When setting up a new scenario, the first step is to look in the scenario book to set up the map tiles and
prepare all the monster types you will be fighting. Then read the introduction text and apply any negative
scenario effects from the “Special Rules” section. Next, two battle goals should be dealt to each player, one of
which will be discarded. Players can then decide which items they would like to equip from the collection of
items they own (adding in -1 cards to their attack modifier decks when applicable). Next, players should decide
which ability cards they would like to put in their hand, choosing from the pool of those available to them. A
player must select a number of cards equal to his or her character’s hand size. When first starting the game, a
player’s hand should only consist of the set of Level 1  ability
cards for the character’s class. Once a player
1
has become familiar with the class, he or she can begin substituting out Level 1 cards for the more complex
X
cards with  as
the level. Once the character begins to level up, he or she will also get access to higher level
cards to add to his or her hand by pulling others out. After players select their hand, any effects of a preceding
road event or city event are applied (see Traveling and Road Events on p. 41 for details).

“Take care of these unfortunates,” he says,
backing out of the room. You can vaguely
make out his silhouette as he retreats down a
hallway and through a door to his left.
“Well, it’s not every day we get people stupid
enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,”
grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a
rusty blade. “We’ll be killing you now.”
Joke’s on them. If you had any valuables, you

Overlay Tiles
A scenario is constructed from a set of map tiles as instructed in the Scenario Book. Additionally, there will be
special overlay tiles to fill out the encounter.

TYPES OF OVERLAY TILES:
•	 Doors . A door acts as a separation between two rooms. When a character
moves onto a closed door tile, they immediately flip over the door tile to the open
side, revealing the adjacent room tile. Immediately place overlay tiles, monsters,
and money tokens as indicated in the scenario description for the revealed room.
While closed doors do not hinder character movement at all, they act as a wall
for any monsters or character-summoned figures, and figures cannot be forced
through a closed door. Open doors do not hinder any movement and cannot be
closed. Door art varies by environment type, but they all function exactly the same.
•	 Corridors . A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the
walls and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors act like normal
empty hexes.
•	 Traps . A trap is sprung when a figure enters its hex with normal or forced
movement. Flying  and Jump  movements are unaffected by traps. When a
trap is sprung, it inflicts some negative effect on the figure who sprung it and then
it is removed from the board. A trap can also be disarmed through specific actions
to remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects. Trap effects are
varied and are specified in the Scenario Book. If part of a trap’s effect is listed as
“damage,” the trap will inflict 2+L damage on the affected figure, where L is the
scenario level. Characters and monsters can also create traps on the board, with
the effects specified by the ability that creates the trap. Whenever a trap is placed
on the board, tokens for the damage and effects the trap applies should be placed
on top of the trap tile for easy reference.
•	 Hazardous terrain . If a figure enters a hex with hazardous terrain via normal
or forced movement, each hex will inflict half the damage of a trap (rounded
down). Flying  and Jump  movements are unaffected by hazardous terrain.
Unlike traps, hazardous terrain does not get removed after its effect is applied, but
instead remains on the board indefinitely. Starting a turn on or exiting these hexes
does not cause additional damage.
•	 Difficult terrain . It takes a figure two normal movement points to enter a hex
with difficult terrain. Flying  , Jump  , and forced movements are unaffected by
difficult terrain.

14

•	 Obstacles . Obstacles have varying artwork, but they all have the same function:
figures cannot move through obstacles with a normal movement, but can move
through them with a Flying  or Jump  movement. Obstacles do not hinder
ranged attacks. It is possible for certain character abilities to create or move
obstacles. When doing so, players can never completely cut off one area of the
scenario map from another, such that the area cannot be moved into without going
through the obstacles.

•	 Treasure . Treasure tiles can be looted by a player (see Loot on p. 27 for details)
for a variety of effects. There are two types of treasure tiles: “goal” tiles and
numbered tiles. Goal tiles are important for the completion of a scenario, and
the rules for looting them will be specified by the scenario. “Goal” tiles are reset
every time a scenario is played. Numbered tiles can provide a number of different
benefits. When one is looted, the looting player should immediately reference
the number of the tile with the treasure index in the back of the scenario book
to discover what was looted. If a specific item name is listed, find this item in
the deck of unique items and immediately add it to your pool of items. If an item
design is listed, find all copies of that item and add them to the city’s available
supply. Numbered treasure tiles can only be looted once. After they have been
looted, they should be crossed off in the Scenario Book as a reminder.

Scenario Level
Monster base statistics, trap damage, the amount of gold received from money tokens, and the amount of
bonus experience for completing a scenario are all dependent on the level of the scenario being played. The
scenario level is chosen by the players before the scenario begins and is based on the average level of the
party and how difficult the players want the scenario to be.
A scenario’s level can be set to any number from 0 to
7, but cannot be changed once the scenario begins.
The recommended scenario level is equal to the
average level of the characters in the party, divided by
2 and rounded up; this would be considered “Normal”
difficulty. If players desire an “Easy” experience, they
can reduce the recommended scenario level by 1. If a
more difficult experience is desired, the scenario level
can be raised by 1 for “Hard” or 2 for “Very Hard.”

Example: If a party contains a Level 6 character, two Level 4 characters, and a Level 3 character, the average
would be 4.25; divided by 2 and rounded up is 3, so a normal scenario difficulty level would be 3. The choice of
scenario level is completely up to the players. Higher scenario levels will result in more difficult monsters, but will
also yield more gold and experience.

Game Variant: Open Information and Solo Play
A single player can play the game as
a solo experience by controlling two
or more characters at once. Part of
the game’s difficulty, however, comes
from not knowing exactly what the
other characters will be doing on their
turn. Because a solo player has precise
information about what each character
is doing and can coordinate more
effectively, the game becomes easier.
To compensate for this, solo players
should increase the monster level and
trap damage by 1 for any given scenario
without increasing gold conversion and
bonus experience.

Additionally, if they wish, a group of players may also play with fully open information by increasing the
difficulty in the same way as for solo play. Playing with open information means that players can share the
exact contents of their hands and discuss specific details about what they plan on doing. This is not the
recommended way to play the game, but it may be desirable for certain groups.

Round Overview
A scenario consists of a series of rounds that are played until players either meet the victory conditions of the
scenario or fail the scenario. A round consists of the following steps:
1.	 Card selection: Each player will either select two cards from his or her hand to play or declare he or she
is performing a long rest action for the round.
2.	 Determining initiative: Players reveal their cards for the round, and an ability card for each monster
type currently in play is also revealed. An initiative order is then determined based on the initiative
values of these revealed cards.
3.	 Character and monster turns: Starting with the lowest initiative, players and monsters will act out their
turns, performing the actions on their cards, possibly modified by character item cards.
4.	 Cleanup: Some cleanup may be required at the end of the round (see End of Round on p. 32 for details).

Card Selection
At the beginning of a round, each player will secretly select two cards from his or her hand to play facedown in
front of them. Of the two cards, one should be selected as the leading card, which will determine the player’s
order in the initiative for the round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).

16

Players should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about any
numerical value or title on any of their cards. They are, however, allowed to make general statements about
their actions for the round and discuss strategy.
•	 Examples of appropriate communication: “I’m attacking this guard near the middle of the round.”;
“I’m planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round, hopefully before the monsters
attack.”
•	 Examples of inappropriate communication: “You’ll need lower than an initiative 17 to go before me.”;
“I should be doing 4 points of damage to the bandit, so you don’t have to worry about him.”; “I’m going
to use Impaling Eruption and wipe out everyone.”
During a player’s turn, the two played cards will be used to perform actions and then are
either discarded, lost, or activated, depending on the actions that were taken. Played
cards are normally placed in a player’s discard pile unless otherwise noted. Discarded
cards can be returned to a player’s hand through resting (see below). If the performed
action from a card contains a  symbol in the lower right of the action field, the card
is instead placed in a player’s lost pile. Lost cards can only be returned to a player’s hand
during a scenario by using a special recover action. Whether the corresponding card is
lost or discarded, some actions may contain an active effect (denoted by the symbols at
right). Instead of being placed in the discard or lost pile, the card is placed in the active
area in front of the player to keep track of the effect. Once the effect wears off, the card
is then transferred to the appropriate pile (see Active Bonuses on pp. 25–26 for details).
Players must either play two cards from their hand or declare a long rest action at the
beginning of every round. If a player only has one card or no cards in their hand, the
long rest action is their only option. If this option is also not available at the beginning
of a round because a player has only one card or no cards in their discard pile as well,
that player is considered exhausted and can no longer participate in the scenario (see
Exhaustion on p. 28 for details).

RESTING
Resting is the main way players can return discarded cards back into their hand of available cards. A player has
two options when resting: a short rest or a long rest. In both cases, the rest action can only be taken if a player
has two or more cards in his or her discard pile, and a rest action always results in losing one of the discarded
cards.
•	 Short rest: During the cleanup step of a round, a player can perform a short rest. This allows that player
to immediately shuffle his or her discard pile and randomly place one of the cards in the lost pile, then
return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. If the player would like to instead keep the
card that was randomly lost, he or she can choose to suffer 1 damage and randomly lose a different
discarded card, but this can only be done once per rest.
•	 Long rest: A long rest is declared during the card selection step of a round and constitutes the player’s
entire turn for the round. Resting players are considered to have an initiative value of 99. On the
player’s turn, at the end of the initiative order, he or she must choose to lose one of his or her discarded
cards, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. The resting character also
performs a “Heal  2, Self” action and refreshes all of his or her spent item cards.

17

Determining Initiative
After players have either selected their two action cards or declared a long rest, the players reveal a monster
ability card for each type of monster that has at least one figure currently on the map. In addition, each player
not taking a long rest reveals his or her selected cards for the round, placing their leading card on top so that
its initiative value is visible.
Initiative order is determined by comparing the initiative values on all played monster ability cards and all of
the players’ leading cards. Whoever has the lowest initiative value takes their turn first, then the next highest,
and so on until every figure on the board has acted. When a monster type takes an action, each monster
of that type will perform the actions listed on their played ability card, starting with elites and then normal
monsters in ascending standee order.
If there is ever a tie in initiative between players, consult the non-leading card of each player to break the tie.
(If there is still a tie, players should decide among themselves who goes first.) If there is a tie between a player
and a monster type, the player goes first. If there is a tie between two monster types, the players decide which
goes first.
Overwhelming Assault
Example: At the start of the round, the Brute
decides that he wishes to play the two cards
shown. He also decides he wants to go late in the
round, so he choses the “61” as his leading card. If
he had wanted to go early, he could have chosen
the “15” as the leading card. The Scoundrel reveals
a leading card with “86” initiative, and the played
Living Bones and Bandit Archer monster ability
cards have “45” and “32” initiative respectively.
The Bandit Archers activate first, then all of the
Living Bones, then the Brute, and finally the
Scoundrel.

On a character’s turn, he or she will perform the top action of one of the two ability cards played and the
bottom action of the other. The leading card designation used to determine initiative is no longer significant.
Either card can be played first for its top or bottom action. When playing a card’s action, the abilities of the
action must be done in the order written and can’t be interrupted by the action on the other card. As soon
as the action of a card is completed, it is immediately placed in the appropriate areaShield
(discardBash
pile, lost pile, or

MOVE
A “Move X” ability allows a character to move up to X number of hexes on the map. Figures
(characters and monsters) can move through allies, but cannot move through enemies or
obstacles. Traps and other terrain effects of hexes must be resolved when a figure enters them
with normal movement. A figure cannot end its movement in the same hex as another figure.
Figures can never move through walls.
Some Move abilities are specified as a “Jump.” Move X (Jump) allows the character to ignore
all figures and terrain effects during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still
considered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above.
Some figures may also have the “Flying” special trait. This allows figures to completely ignore
any figures and terrain tiles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except
that they still must end their movement in an unoccupied hex (no figures present). This includes
forced movement like PUSH or PULL. If a figure loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle
hex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the
nearest empty hex (no figures, tokens, or overlay tiles of any kind present except corridors,
pressure plates, and open doors).

REVEALING A ROOM
During any part of a character’s movement, if they enter a tile with a closed door, flip the door tile to the
opened side and immediately reveal the adjacent room on the other side of the door. The Scenario Book will
then specify what monsters, money tokens, and special overlay tiles should be placed in the revealed room,
based on the number of characters (including exhausted characters). Note that, as in scenario setup, the
standee numbers of the monsters in the new room should be randomized when placed. It is possible to run out
of specific types of monster standees when revealing a room. If this happens, place only the standees that are
available, starting with the monsters closest to the revealing character.
Once everything is placed in the new room, any present monster types without an action card should have one
drawn for them now. Once the revealing character’s turn ends, the initiative values of all monsters in the new
room are reviewed, and any monster type that has a lower initiative value than the revealing character (i.e.,
they should have acted earlier in the round) must immediately act out their turn (in normal initiative order in
case of multiple monster types in this situation). This ensures that all monsters revealed in the new room will
always take a turn in the round in which they are revealed.

ATTACK
An “Attack X” ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within
their range. Figures cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.
Ranged attacks are accompanied by a “Range Y” value, which means any enemy within Y
hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains
Disadvantage against that target (see Advantage and Disadvantage on pp. 20–21 for details).
Melee attacks have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default
range of 1 hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies.
Line-of-sight: All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within
line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any
corner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall (the line edge of a map tile
or the entire area of any partial hex along the edge of a map tile, unless covered by an overlay
tile). Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, any ability which specifies a range can only be
performed on a figure within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range,
then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not
considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls.

19

When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the
following order. Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:
•	 An attacker’s attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from
active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from POISON).
•	 Next, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied.
•	 Lastly, the defender’s defensive bonuses are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each
individual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.
•	 If there are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which
they are applied. Also note that because the bonuses are applied per target, it is possible for the same
attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets.
Example: The Scoundrel performs an “Attack 3” ability on an adjacent elite Bandit Guard. The Scoundrel adds a
+2 attack modifier because of specific conditions set by the card and also is allowed to double the attack because
of an active card in front of her. She chooses to add the +2, then doubles the result, resulting in an “Attack 10.”
She then plays an attack modifier card to reveal a “-1,” so the attack is reduced to 9. Finally, the Bandit Guard
has a shield value of 1, so the attack value is reduced to 8 and the bandit suffers 8 damage.
Any damage suffered by a monster should be tracked on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding to the
number on the specific monster’s standee. When a monster is brought to zero or fewer hit points by an attack
or any source of damage, that monster immediately dies and is removed from the board. Any additional effects
of an attack are not applied once a monster dies.
When a monster dies, a money token is also placed on the hex where it died if the monster was not
summoned or spawned.

If there is ambiguity about which card drawn is better or worse, use whichever card was drawn first. Ambiguity
can occur when comparing one or more added effects provided by attack modifier cards (e.g., elemental
infusions, negative conditions, etc.) All added effects should be considered to have a positive but undefined
numerical value.
Instances of Advantage and Disadvantage are mostly gained by specific character or monster abilities. However,
any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy also gains Disadvantage for that target. Instances of Advantage
or Disadvantage don’t stack, and if an attack has instances of both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel
out each other and the attack is performed normally.

AREA EFFECTS
Some attacks and other abilities allow figures to target multiple hexes or multiple targets at the same time. In
these cases, the area of effect for the ability is shown on the ability card. Note that any rotational orientation
of the depicted diagram is valid. Also note that each target constitutes a separate attack (drawing its own
attack modifier card), but all attacks together make up a single attack action.
a Grey indicates the hex on which the figure is currently located. An area

to target the same enemy with multiple attacks from the same ability. Note: Abilities can never target allies
(positive abilities meant for allies will use the term “affect” instead of “target”). An ally can be within the
affected area of an attack, but they will not be targeted by it.
Note also that as long as an attack does not specify range, it is considered melee, such that it is possible to
attack a non-adjacent target with a melee attack if hex configuration allows.

21

ATTACK EFFECTS
Attack abilities will often have effects that increase their power. If an attack effect is listed on an ability card
after an attack, the target (or targets) of the attack is subject to the additional effect as well, after damage
from the attack is resolved. Attack effects are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does
damage. These effects (except experience gains) are optional and can be skipped. Some character actions can
also apply these effects without an attack, and in such cases the target of the effect is written on the ability
card.
PUSH X – The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each
hex moved must place the target farther away from the attacker than it was previously. If there
are no viable hexes into which to push the target, the push ends. The target can be pushed
through its allies, but not its enemies.
PULL X – The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex
moved must place the target closer to the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable
hexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends. The target can be pulled through its allies, but
not its enemies. Both push and pull effects are considered movements, however, they are not
affected by difficult terrain.
PIERCE X – Up to X points of the target’s Shield are ignored for the attack. Unlike other effects,
PIERCE is applied while calculating the accompanying attack damage instead of afterwards.
Example: an Attack 3 PIERCE 2 ability used on a monster with Shield 3 would ignore two of
the monster’s Shield points and inflict 2 damage (modified by an attack modifier card).
ADD TARGET – If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an
additional target within range to their attack. All added effects and conditions of the attack action
are applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside
of the original added target (e.g., area attacks).

CONDITIONS
Certain abilities may apply conditions to their targets. When a condition is applied to a figure (except CURSE
and BLESS), the respective token is placed on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding the number on the
specific monster’s standee to signify the effect. The condition remains on the figure until the requirements for
removing the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single figure at a
time, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.
The following are negative conditions. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it,
then the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions
are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.
POISON – If a figure is poisoned, all enemies add +1 Attack to all of their attacks targeting the
figure. If a Heal ability is used on a poisoned figure, the POISON token is removed, and the Heal
has no other effect.
WOUND – If a figure is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If
a Heal ability is used on a wounded figure, the WOUND token is removed and the Heal continues
normally. If a figure is both poisoned and wounded, a Heal ability would remove both conditions
but have no other effect.
IMMOBILIZE – If a figure is immobilized, it cannot perform any move abilities on its turn. At the
end of its next turn, the IMMOBILIZE token is removed.

22

DISARM – If a figure is disarmed, it cannot perform any attack abilities on its turn. At the end of its
next turn, the DISARM token is removed.
STUN – If a figure is stunned, it cannot perform any abilities or use items on its turn except to
perform a long rest (in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the STUN token is
removed. Players must still play two cards or rest on their turn, and if a player plays two cards
while stunned, the actions played are not used, and the cards are simply discarded.
MUDDLE – If a figure is muddled, it gains Disadvantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next
turn, the MUDDLE token is removed.
CURSE – If a figure is cursed, it must shuffle a CURSE card into its remaining
attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s
attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack
M
modifier discard pile. Note that there are two separate curse decks: 10 cards
with a  in the lower left corner and 10 cards with an  .   cards can only
be placed in the monster attack deck (when a monster is cursed), and  cards can only be placed
in a character's attack deck (when a character or character summon is cursed). Thus, a maximum
of only 10 curse cards can be placed into any one deck.
423

422

The following are positive conditions. Figures can apply positive conditions to themselves or allies through
specific actions. Positive conditions cannot be prematurely removed.
INVISIBLE – If a figure is invisible, it cannot be focused on or targeted by an enemy. Invisibility does
not affect a figure’s interactions with his or her allies. At the end of its next turn, the INVISIBLE
token is removed. Monsters treat invisible characters exactly as if they were obstacles.
STRENGTHEN – If a figure is strengthened, it gains Advantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its
next turn, the STRENGTHEN token is removed.
BLESS – If a figure is blessed, it must shuffle a BLESS card into its remaining
attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s
attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack
modifier discard pile.

ELEMENTAL INFUSIONS
Some abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either Fire, Ice, Air, Earth, Light, or Dark). If
a it means that by performing any part
any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description  ,
of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element. This is represented by moving the
corresponding element’s token to the “Strong” column of the elemental infusion table at the end of the turn in
which the ability was used.

At the end of every round, however, all elemental infusions
will wane, moving one step to the left in the table, from
“Strong” to “Waning” or from “Waning” to “Inert.”

Elemental infusions can be used to augment the effects of
certain abilities. This augment is represented by an elemental
symbol covered with a red    ,
b followed by a colon and
how the ability is augmented if the element is consumed. If an
ability is used that consumes an element and the corresponding
element token is in the Strong or Waning column, that element
token may be used to augment the ability by moving the token to
the Inert column. A single icon cannot be used to consume more
than one infusion, and it is not possible to create an element
and consume it on the same turn, but it may be consumed by
anyone with a later turn in the initiative order of the same round.

If an ability contains multiple separate augments, the player may
choose which augments to use in any order. If a single augment
lists multiple element uses, all elements must be used to activate
the augment.

Just like characters, monsters also have the ability to create
and consume elements. Monsters always consume elements if
they can, and every activated monster of that type will gain the
benefit of the consumed element, not just the first monster to
consume it.

ACTIVE BONUSES
Some abilities can give a character, or his or her allies, bonuses on other abilities, either persistently until
certain conditions are fulfilled or for the rest of the round. These abilities are denoted with symbols, and the
cards with these effects are played into the active area in front of the player to keep track of these bonuses.
Persistent bonuses can be identified by the symbol   displayed on the card. These ability effects will be
active from the time the card is played until the conditions specified on the card are met. These conditions
usually track the number of times a particular game event has occurred, such as making or defending against an
attack. Place a token on the first marked position of the card’s action and advance it one space each time the
effect is triggered, left to right, top to bottom. When the ability has been used once for each space on the card,
remove the card from play by placing it in the lost pile. Players must use the benefits of a persistent bonus
when possible, even if no benefit is gained. If there are no conditions specified or positions marked, the card
may remain in the player’s active area for the rest of the scenario and can be removed from play at any time by
placing it in the lost pile.

bonus is no longer active.

Round bonuses will have this symbol   on the card. The effect of the ability will be active from the time
the card is played until the end of the round, at which point the card will be placed in the player’s discard or
lost pile (depending on whether the action also contains an  symbol).
Even though a bonus card is placed in the active area, it is still considered discarded or lost, depending on
whether the action also contains an   symbol. At any time, these cards can be moved to the appropriate pile,
however, doing so immediately removes any bonuses that were being applied by the card.

SHIELD
A “Shield X” bonus ability gives the recipient a defender’s bonus that reduces any incoming
attack value by X. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another and can be applied in any
order. A shield bonus only applies to damage caused by an attack.

25

RETALIATE
A “Retaliate X” bonus ability causes the recipient to inflict X points of damage on figures who
attack it from an adjacent hex for each attack made. A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied
by a “Range Y” value, which means that the retaliate damage is applied to any attacker within Y
hexes. A retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it. If the retaliating figure is killed or
exhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack
with one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect.

HEAL
A “Heal X” ability allows a figure to return X hit points to either themselves or one ally within the
ability’s range. Heals are always accompanied by one of two labels:
•	 “Range Y” means that any ally within Y hexes, or the figure performing the heal, can be
affected by the heal. Like all ranged abilities, the recipient must be in line-of-sight.
•	 “Self” mean the figure can only affect him or herself with the heal.

SUMMON
Some abilities summon other ally figures to the board. Summoned
figures (summons) are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the
figure performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the
summon ability cannot be used. Summons are represented by a
colored summon token. There are eight different colors of summon
tokens so that multiple summons can be tracked at the same time,
and players can assign any color they like to a specific summon,
placing tracker tokens on their summon ability cards for easy
reference.

A summon’s turn in the initiative order is always directly before the
character who summoned it, and is separate from that character’s
turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but
instead obey automated monster rules, permanently following the
ability card “Move+0, Attack+0” (see Monster Turn on pp. 29–32
for details) and using the player’s attack modifier deck to perform
its attacks.

26

Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move
value, and range value along with any special traits written on the
ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card
is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit
points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active
area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the
summon is removed from the board.

A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play
at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were
summoned. Summoned figures never take a turn in the round they
are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the
summon.

RECOVER AND REFRESH
Certain abilities allow a player to recover discarded or lost ability cards. This means that the player can look
through his or her discard or lost pile (or discarded or lost cards in his or her active area), select up to a number
of cards specified in the ability, and immediately return them to his or her hand. Some cards, however, cannot
be recovered or refreshed once lost. This is denoted by the   symbol. This symbol applies to the card no
matter how the card was lost or consumed.
Refresh abilities allow players to regain the use of spent or consumed item cards.
In the case of both recover and refresh, the type of card gained (discarded or lost for ability cards, spent or
consumed for item cards) is specified in the ability.

Recover Ability Card

Refresh Item

LOOT

Cannot be recovered or
refreshed once lost or

A “Loot X” ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within
range X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this
is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight. Money tokens are kept in a
player’s personal supply and are not shared with the other players. If a treasure tile is looted,
immediately refer to the reference number in the treasure index in the back of the scenario
book to determine what is found (see Treasure on p. 15 for details). If a character loots an
item he or she already owns a copy of, the new item is immediately sold to the city’s available
supply (see Buying and Selling Items on p. 43 for details).

END-OF-TURN LOOTING

In addition to specific loot abilities, a character must also loot any money tokens or treasure tiles present in
the hex he or she occupies at the end of the character’s turn. Character summons do not perform end-of-turn
looting.

GAINING EXPERIENCE
Some actions also have an experience value attached to them,
denoted by  . When that action is taken, the character gains
the number of experience specified. An ability card cannot be
played for the experience alone—a character must use one
or more of the accompanying abilities to earn the experience.
In addition, sometimes the action specifies that experience is
only earned under certain conditions, such as consuming an
elemental infusion or if the attacked target is adjacent to an

EXHAUSTION
A character can become exhausted in one of two ways:
•	 If a character ever drops below one hit point on the hit point tracker, or…
•	 If, at the beginning of a round, a player cannot play two cards from his or her hand (because they have
one card or no cards in his or her hand) and also cannot rest (because they have one card or no cards
in their discard pile). Exhaustion due to insufficient cards does not affect a character’s current hit point
total.
In either case, all ability cards are placed in the characters lost pile, the character’s figure is removed from
the map, and the character can no longer participate in the scenario in any way. There is no coming back
from being exhausted during a scenario, and thus it should be avoided at all costs. If all characters become
exhausted during a scenario, the scenario is lost.

ITEMS
Characters can use items at any time, within the constraints of what is written on the item card, including
in the middle of a card ability. However, if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage,
or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn. If an effect is added to an attack, it
functions exactly as if it had been written on the action card being used for the attack. There is no limit to the
number of items a character can use on their turn or even during a specific ability. Any instance of applying
the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use. Like persistent abilities, an item with multiple use
circles must be used when the situation applies.

28

Monster Turn
Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a system of action cards that automate what the monsters will do on
their turn in the initiative order. They are not controlled by a separate player. All monsters will perform the
actions listed on their ability card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these
actions are listed on their card.
Note that each type of monster can come in two ranks: normal and elite. Normal monsters are designated
with a white stand and elite monsters are designated with a gold stand. When an elite monster acts, use the
statistics in the “Elite” section of the monster statistic card.

ORDER OF ACTION
All monsters of the same type take individual turns at the same initiative value listed on their monster ability
card. All elites of a type activate first, then the normal monsters of that type activate. If more than one elite
or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters activate in ascending numerical
a
order according to the numbers on their tokens  .
Example: With the setup to the left, the elite monster to

In addition to determining order of action, the number

on the monster standee  corresponds
to a section of

used
to track
b
damage and condition tokens.

Before performing any action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy­­—
either a character or character summon.
•	 A monster will focus on the enemy figure it can perform its current attack against using the least
amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its
attack, and the figure that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy figure is
considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its
current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. If a monster does not have
an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case
where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of
multiple enemy figures (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple enemies), proximity from
the monster’s current position (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then
checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”

29

•	 If more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who
is earlier in the initiative order (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them
in this regard, even on the round they are summoned, and a character who is performing a long rest
would be focused on last).
a physically
Example: Even though the Brute  is
closer to Monster  ,
1 the monster is performing a
melee attack and can get in range of the Tinkerer in
fewer steps (2 instead of 4), so the monster focuses
on the Tinkerer  .
b
In the case where there are no valid targets on
which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a
monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked,
occupied, or there is no open path to reach them),
regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a
monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it
will perform any of the other actions on its ability
card that it is able.

MONSTER MOVEMENT
A monster can move on its turn if “Move±X” is part of its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes
equal to its base move value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative).
If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get
as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest
possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.
If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such
a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect. If it is a single-target melee attack, it will simply
move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a
position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.
If the monster is performing a ranged attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform
its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged
attack without Disadvantage. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing Disadvantage on its
focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets. Even if a monster cannot move into attack
range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus.
Having abilities other than “Attack” on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will
simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can.

MONSTER INTERACTION WITH TRAPS AND HAZARDOUS TERRAIN
Monsters without the Flying trait consider negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain) to be obstacles when
determining focus and movement unless movement through one of these hexes is the only way they can focus
on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible
to find a focus and suffer any consequences.

MONSTER ATTACKS
A monster will attack on its turn if “Attack±X” is part of its ability card. Any damage dealt is calculated from its
base attack value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative). Monsters will
always attack their focused enemies (see Monster Focus on pp. 29–30 for details) but if the monster can attack
multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to maximum effect. If a
monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding
figures it is already attacking. Any attack that does not specify a range on the monster ability card should use
the base range of the monster written on its stat card.
Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then
attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target. They may be performed with Advantage or
Disadvantage as discussed on pp. 20–21.

OTHER MONSTER ABILITIES
Healing: Monster healing functions exactly like character healing as discussed on p. 26. With a “Heal X” ability,
the monster will heal themselves or an ally within the specified range, whichever has lost the most hit points.
Summons: Monster summon abilities place new monsters on the board that behave exactly like the normal
monsters, acting according to played monster ability cards of their type. Summoned monsters are placed in an
empty hex adjacent to the summoning monster and also as close to an enemy as possible. If there are no empty
adjacent hexes or there are no available standees of the summoned monster type, the summon fails. Summoned
monsters never act on the round they are summoned, nor do they drop money tokens when killed.

31

Bonus abilities: Ability card bonuses are activated through actions only when the monster activates and are
only active until the end of the round in which the card was drawn.
Looting: Monsters do not perform end-of-turn looting, but some monsters do have loot actions. In these cases,
a monster will pick up all money tokens within the specified range. These money tokens are lost and are not
dropped again when the looting monster is killed. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.

AMBIGUITY
If the rules ever make any monster action ambiguous because there are multiple viable hexes to which the
monster could move, multiple equally viable targets to heal or attack, or multiple hexes a monster could push
or pull a character into, the players must decide which option the monster will take.

End of Round
Once all figures have taken a turn, the round ends and some cleanup steps may be necessary:
•	 If a standard “2x”    or “Null”    attack modifier card was drawn from a specific modifier deck
during the round, shuffle all the discards of that deck back into its draw deck.
•	 If a monster ability card with a shuffle symbol   was drawn at the start of the round, shuffle all
discards for the corresponding monster type back into its deck.
•	 If there are any elemental infusion tokens in the Strong column, move them to the Waning column. If
there are any elemental infusion tokens in the Waning column, move them to Inert.
•	 Place all active round bonus ability cards in the appropriate discard or lost pile (depending on whether
an action with a [lost card] symbol was used).
•	 Players may also perform a short rest (see Resting on p. 17 for details) if they are able.

32

ROUND TRACKER
Some scenarios may require players to keep track of what
round it is. A round track can be found at the top of the
elemental infusion table for this purpose. At the end of
a forward
every round, simply move the tracker token  
one space. Note that it is not necessary to keep track of
the rounds for most scenarios.

Finishing a Scenario

immediately earns a character an additional perk (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). Even if a character

for details).
If players are playing in a campaign, successfully completing a scenario
will also allow them to read the conclusion flavor text of the scenario
and gain the benefits listed at the end (see Scenario Completion on
p. 49 for details). In a campaign the money and experience collected
during a scenario will be very important to improve a character’s skills
and abilities and should be tracked on the player’s character sheet  .

If the scenario was not part of a campaign, money and experience can
be used as metric for gauging how well each character did.

Special Scenario Rules
Many scenarios will feature extra rules. The following are clarifications for common special scenario rules:
•	 Spawning: When a monster is spawned, it is set up on the map at its spawning location or the nearest
empty hex to that location. If a monster is spawned at the end of a round, it will begin to activate on the
following round. If a monster is spawned during a round, it activates as if it had just been revealed (see
Revealing a Room on p. 19 for details).
•	 Locked doors: Some doors are classified as “locked,” which means they cannot be opened by a character
moving onto them. Instead, they act as walls until the conditions to open them specified in the scenario
book are met.
•	 Pressure plates: Pressure plates function similarly to corridors, in that they have no effect on a figure’s
movement. Instead, if a pressure plate is occupied by a character at the end of a turn, it may trigger a
special effect specified in the scenario book, such as opening a door or spawning a monster.
•	 Destroying obstacles: When an obstacle is specified as having hit points in the scenario book, it can be
attacked and will be destroyed and removed from the board when it drops below 1 hit point. Obstacles
with hit points can only be destroyed through damage and not through other character abilities. These
obstacles are considered enemies for all ability purposes and have an initiative of 99 for the purpose of
summon focusing, but they are immune to all negative conditions.
a
•	 Objective and scenario aid tokens: Objective tokens  are
used in many scenarios

to represent allied figures or loot locations. In the case of allied figures, the numbers
a
b
on the tokens should be randomized when placed, with the numbers determining
the figures’ activation order. Scenario aid tokens  can
be placed on the map tiles to act as a reminder for
b
special cases, such as where enemies spawn or when to read numbered sections from the scenario book.
•	 Named monsters: Often times the goal of a scenario is to kill a specific monster, either a boss or a unique
variant of a regular monster, as specified in the scenario rules. These monsters are not considered normal
or elite and thus are not affected by character abilities that target only normal or elite monsters.
•	 Equations: Some scenario properties such as hit points for obstacles or named monsters are determined by
equations that depend on the scenario level and the number of characters. In such instances, “L” is used to
denote the scenario level, and “C” is used to denote the number of characters.

Campaign Overview
There are two ways to play Gloomhaven: campaign mode and casual mode.
In campaign mode, players will form an official party of characters and undertake a number of consecutive scenarios
over multiple play sessions. This allows players to follow a story thread as they make decisions and explore a path
of their own choosing. A scenario can only be played in campaign mode if all the prerequisite global and party
achievements listed as required in the Scenario Book are active for the party. In addition, once a scenario has been
completed in campaign mode, it cannot be undertaken again in campaign mode by any party.
In casual mode, players can play any revealed scenario on the world map regardless of achievements or whether it has
been completed in campaign mode. Players can still gain experience and money, loot treasure tiles, complete battle
goals, and make progress toward completing their personal quests, but any story text or rewards listed at the end of
the scenario are disregarded. A party in campaign mode can switch to casual mode to go through a scenario they have
already completed, but it is strongly recommended that a party not undertake a scenario in casual mode that they
haven’t yet experienced in campaign mode.

The rules that follow will deal specifically with playing the game in campaign mode.

34

Campaign Board
The campaign board is used to track the global progress of the game world. The locations, achievements, and
prosperity tracked on the board apply globally to all parties playing in the world.

should be marked for every point of increase, moving from left to right (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on
p. 48 for details). At certain thresholds, this will increase the prosperity level of Gloomhaven.

35

Party Sheet
A party is formed when a new group of players gets together to play the game. They will document the
formation of the party by starting a new entry in the party sheet notepad. Party achievements, reputation, and
location will be tracked on this notepad.
A party can persist from scenario to scenario and play session to play session, as long as the players want. The
makeup of the party will change over time, especially as characters retire and new characters are created.
Changes to the party makeup are fine, not only for characters, but players as well. New parties can also be
formed at any time, though new characters should be made for a new party.

Character Sheet
When a new character is created, the player should start a new entry in the character’s corresponding
character sheet notepad. As players play through a campaign, they will need to keep notes on what experience,
gold, items, perks, and available ability cards they have in their deck by using this character sheet.

Personal Quest Cards
When a character is created, he or she is dealt two random personal quest cards and chooses one to keep,
returning the other to the personal quest deck. A character’s personal quest is their primary reason for
participating in a party.

A PERSONAL QUEST CARD INCLUDES:
a
•	 A thematic description of the quest  .
•	 The specific requirements for completing the
quest and the rewards for doing so  .
b When a
personal quest is completed, the character will
retire (see Announcing Retirement on p. 48 for
details).

Random Item Design Cards
Whenever a “Random Item Design” is listed as the reward
when looting a treasure tile, the looting player should draw
a card from the random item design deck. These cards look
very similar to normal item cards, but have a blue back,
shown at the right. When a card is drawn, the player should
find the one additional copy of the drawn item with the
same reference number in the deck of unavailable items and
add both cards to the city’s available supply of items. It is
possible to deplete the random item design deck. In this case,
additional random item design rewards have no effect.

Random Side Scenario Cards
Whenever a “Random Side Scenario” is listed as the reward
when looting a treasure tile, the looting players should draw
a card from the random side scenario deck. The drawn
scenario is then immediately unlocked and its corresponding
sticker is placed on the campaign map. The drawn scenario
card is then removed from the game. It is possible to deplete
the random side scenario deck. In this case, additional
random side scenario rewards have no effect.

You ended up embarking out on the road much
later than you had hoped — events in town saw to
that — but as dusk settles on the horizon you feel
conﬁdent that you are up to any threat you might
face.
And then begins the howling of wolves — vicious,
foul beasts — and, judging from their sounds, they
seem to be getting closer.

Option B: Let the wolves come.

Road Event Card

h

i

When the game box is opened and the campaign begins, a shuffled city event deck and road event deck should
both be created using city and road events 01 through 30. Players will be directed to add or remove certain
events from these decks over the course of the campaign. When a card is added to an event deck, the event
deck should then be shuffled. Note that adding a card is different from returning a played card to an event
deck, in which case it is placed on the bottom of the deck and the deck is not shuffled.

39

Sealed Boxes and Envelopes
The game box includes a number of sealed boxes and envelopes, each designated with a symbol or letter. At
certain times, the game will direct players to open one of these. If it contains materials for a new character
class, that character class is now available for anyone starting a new character. If the envelope contains other
contents, the contents will direct the players how to use them.
Players will be directed to open boxes or envelopes when they complete personal quests or meet specific
conditions. These conditions are listed on p. 49.

Town Records
The game box also includes a small sealed book titled “Town Records.” Players are
directed to open this book once the first character retires, at which point they can
begin reading the book from front to back. At certain points in the book, players will
be directed to stop reading until certain conditions are met.

Achievements
The achievement system is the main way that players will keep track of major changes in the world and
what scenarios a particular party has access to while playing in campaign mode. There are two types of
achievements: global achievements and party achievements.
Global achievements affect the entire game world, regardless of what party is playing in it. Global

specific type (listed after the achievement in the format of “Type: Achievement,” e.g., “City Rule: Militaristic”).
Only one global achievement of each type can be active at a time. If a global achievement is gained and there is
already an active achievement of the same type, the previous achievement is overwritten and the new sticker is
placed on top of the previous one. Multiple instances of a single global achievement are possible, so long they
don’t have a specific type.
a

Party achievements are tied to a specific party and are mainly used
to keep track of what scenarios are available to play in campaign
mode for that party.

Playing a Campaign
Traveling and Road Events
After every scenario, whether it was a success or failure, players have the choice to either return to
Gloomhaven or to immediately travel to a new scenario.
In the case that players immediately travel to a new scenario, they must complete a road event before starting
the new scenario unless they are playing the same scenario, the new scenario is linked to the previous
scenario, or they are playing in casual mode. In a scenario’s entry in the Scenario Book, the scenarios that are

“Collective” rewards or penalties are distributed among the party, and rewards or penalties specified as
“each” are applied to each character in the party individually. If a player is directed to lose anything (money,
checkmarks, etc.), but they cannot do so because they do not have a sufficient amount of that thing to lose,
they lose what they are able to lose and continue resolving the event. A character can never lose a checkmark
that would cause him or her to lose a perk, have negative money, or be brought below the minimum
experience required for his or her current level, and the town can never be brought below the minimum
prosperity for its current level.

REPUTATION
Reputation is tied to a specific party and is tracked on the party sheet. Any time a new party is formed, that
party starts at 0 reputation. Through event consequences or by completing certain scenarios, the party will
gain or lose reputation. A party can have a maximum reputation of 20 and a minimum reputation of -20.
A party’s reputation has a number of implications:
•	 Many events have consequences that are only applied if the party meets specific reputation
requirements.
•	 When buying items, players modify the cost based on their reputation. They receive a reduction in
cost at a higher reputation and an increase in cost at a lower reputation. These cost modifications are
written next to the reputation track on the party sheet.
•	 Certain sealed envelopes are opened when a party reaches specific positive and negative values of
reputation.

Visiting Gloomhaven
Whenever a party returns to Gloomhaven, they can perform a variety of activities: creating new characters,
completing city events, buying and selling items, leveling up their character, donating to the sanctuary,
enhancing ability cards, and announcing retirement. A new visit to Gloomhaven can be triggered after every
scenario played in campaign mode.

CREATING NEW CHARACTERS
The first step in any character’s story is creation. Players will create new characters when they first start playing
the game, when they retire an old character and wish to continue playing, or pretty much whenever they want
to try something new. When the box is first opened, the following six classes are available to play: Brute   ,
Tinkerer   , Spellweaver   , Scoundrel   , Cragheart   , and Mindthief   .
When a player creates a new character, he or she gains access to that character’s character mat and deck of
Level 1 and “X” ability cards. The player should create a new entry in the class’s corresponding character sheet
notepad, and also draw two random personal quest cards, choosing to keep one and shuffling the other back
into the deck.
A player can start a character at any level equal to or lower than the prosperity level of the city (see
Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 for details). If a player starts a character above Level 1, they should go through
all the steps outlined on p. 44 for each level increase in sequence, up to and including their chosen starting
level. In addition, a newly created character receives an amount of gold equal to 15x(L+1), where L is their
starting level. A character starts with an amount of experience equal to the minimum required for their level
(the number listed below that level on the character sheet).

42

COMPLETING CITY EVENTS
Once per visit to Gloomhaven, a party may complete a city event. City events are functionally the same as road
events, but are drawn from the city event deck and generally have better outcomes than road events.

BUYING AND SELLING ITEMS
When in Gloomhaven, characters have the opportunity to
buy item cards by spending the gold they’ve collected from
scenarios. In addition, players can also sell back any item
for half the price listed on the item card (rounded down).
When an item is sold, it goes back into the city’s available
supply, and the character receives the calculated amount of
gold. Players can own as many items as they can afford, but
are limited in how many they can equip (see Item Cards on
p. 8 for details). Players cannot trade money or items.

When the game box is opened and the campaign begins, the city’s available supply should consist of all copies
of Item 001 through Item 014. Over the course of the campaign, many more items will be added to the city’s
available supply based on the following conditions:
Prosp.
Item Cards
•	 Any time an item design is gained from a scenario or event, every copy
of that item card is added to the city’s available supply.

•	 As the city gains prosperity levels (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48
for details), new items will be made available in the supply. The list of
what items are made available at each prosperity level can be found to
the right.
•	 Lastly, when a character retires, all of their item cards go back into the
shop’s supply.

Within any one party, the number of items available for purchase is limited by how many copies of the item’s
card there are. No character may own duplicates of the same item. If a different party plays the game with
different characters, items possessed by unused characters are considered to be in the city’s available supply
and can be purchased. Players should always keep track of what items they own on their character sheets in
case the cards get moved around by other groups.

LEVELING UP
When a character gains the amount of experience listed on the table to the
right, they must level up. Leveling up only occurs in town.

Additionally, when leveling up, the player can mark one

BUILDING A HAND OF CARDS
When playing a class for the first time, it is recommended that players use a hand comprised entirely of
1
Level 1 cards (denoted by a  below
the title). However, each character also has immediate access to
three  cards.
These are typically more complex and situational than Level 1 cards. Once a player is familiar

with the basic abilities of the class, they should consider incorporating one or more  cards
into their hand,

DONATING TO THE SANCTUARY

Once per visit to Gloomhaven, each player can donate 10 gold to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak, a temple and
hospital in the city. Doing so allows the donating player to add two BLESS    attack modifier cards to their
attack modifier deck for the next scenario.

ENHANCING ABILITY CARDS

Trample

Once players have completed “The Power of Enhancement”
1 global achievement, they can spend gold while
visiting Gloomhaven to increase the power of their ability cards. To do this, a player places the desired sticker
a
from the enhancement sticker sheets onto a designated spot  of
an ability card in their character’s active
card pool. This sticker denotes a permanent enhancement to the ability.

Attack 3
PIERCE

a

Ability cards can be enhanced in a variety of ways, with each costing a specific amount of gold. This cost must
be paid by the character whose ability card is being enhanced.

Each kind of enhancement sticker has a different function and has restrictions on where it can be placed. “Main
line ability” refers to an ability written in large font (as opposed to modifiers written in a smaller font under the
main line):
Can be placed on any ability line or summon
base stat line with a numerical value. That
value is increased by 1.

does not count as affecting yourself. The
specified condition is applied to all targets
of the ability.
Can be placed on any “Move” ability line.

depiction of an area attack. The new hex
becomes an additional target of the attack.
The base cost associated with any enhancement depends on the sticker and what ability the sticker is
enhancing. Double the base cost of an enhancement (other than an attack hex) if it is applied to an ability that
targets multiple figures. Additional costs are added based on the level of the ability card and the number of
previously placed enhancement stickers on the same action.
The total number of enhanced cards in a class’s ability deck must be equal to or less than the prosperity level
of the town. Once placed, enhancement stickers should never be removed. Enhancements persist through all
instances of a specific character class, even after retirement.

ANNOUNCING RETIREMENT
If a character currently fulfills the conditions of his or her personal quest and is visiting Gloomhaven, the
character must announce retirement. The character may perform any other town activities beforehand,
but he or she cannot play any new scenarios using a character with a fulfilled personal quest. The character
has accomplished his or her dreams and has no more motivation to go exploring monster-filled ruins. All the
materials for the character are returned to the box, any items the character owned are returned to the city’s
available supply, and all money the character owned is gone. Additionally, the city gains 1 prosperity.
Fulfilling personal quests will always unlock new content for the game. They will allow the player to open a
sealed box or envelope, which will usually unlock a new character class. Any time players are directed to open
a box or envelope and it has already been opened because of some previous condition, a new random item
design and random side scenario are unlocked instead (see p. 38 for details). When a personal quest is fulfilled,
the personal quest card is removed from the game.
Each time an individual player retires a character, that player also gains one extra perk to apply to all future
characters they create. This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, his or her next
character would gain two additional perks. Though this effect is applied to players, if one player is controlling
multiple characters at once in a campaign (e.g., solo play), he or she considers each character lineage they
control a different player for this bonus.
When a specific character class retires for the first time, new city and road events are usually added to the
events decks. The reference number for these is written on the back side of the class’s character mat in the
bottom right (rightmost number). In addition, whenever a new character class is unlocked through retirement
or other means, new city and road events are also added to the decks. This reference number is on the back
side of the unlocked class’s character mat in the bottom right (leftmost number). Each reference number
applies to both the city and road event decks.
When a player’s character retires, they can choose a new character to play, drawing two new personal quest
cards, keeping one and discarding the other. Players are free to use the same class for their new character, but
fulfilling personal quests usually unlocks a new class, encouraging players to explore new play styles over the
course of the campaign. New characters may start at any level equal to or less than the current prosperity level
of the town.
It is possible to run out of available personal quest cards. If there are no personal quest cards left when a player
creates a new character, then that character does not receive a personal quest. A character without a personal
quest can never retire, though the player is still free to switch characters whenever he or she wishes.

GLOOMHAVEN PROSPERITY
As the characters grow in power, the town of Gloomhaven grows in prosperity. Gloomhaven prosperity can
be gained either through certain events or by completing certain scenarios. The prosperity points are tracked
along the bottom of the map board  ,
a and the town will attain new levels when reaching the designated
thresholds.
a
When the city reaches a new level of prosperity, players gain two benefits:
•	 New items become available for purchase, according to the chart on p. 43.
•	 New characters may begin at any level equal to or less than the prosperity level of the town. Likewise,
any character with a level lower than the prosperity level may immediately advance their level to match.
In either case, follow the level-up steps on p. 44, adjusting the character’s experience value to the
minimum value required for the new level.

Game Variant: Permanent Death
If players desire an extra threat of danger, they can decide to play Gloomhaven with permanent death. Any
character will permanently die when they drop below one hit point (instead of being exhausted). Characters
can still become exhausted as normal if they are unable to rest or play cards, except that their figure remains
on the map and can still be targeted by monster attacks. The character cannot act at all and is considered to
have an initiative of 99 for the purposes of monster focus. After a scenario is failed, any character who is still
alive at the end of the round survives and can continue playing.
When a character dies, all the materials for the character are returned to the box, any items the character
owned are returned to the city’s available supply, all money the character owned is gone, their personal quest
is shuffled back into the personal quest deck, and their character sheet is removed from the game. The player
whose character died must then create a new character (see Creating New Characters on p. 42 for details) to
continue playing.

Game Variant: Random Dungeon Deck
Instead of playing through a scenario from the Scenario Book, players always have the option to play through a
random dungeon instead. Random dungeons will not progress the campaign in any way, but they can be used
to gain additional experience, money, checkmarks, and personal quest progress for characters.
Each random dungeon consists of three randomly generated rooms and the goal is always to clear all rooms of
monsters. The three rooms will be set up one at a time, with the next room only being revealed once the door
to it has been opened. Each room is set up using a room card and a monster card, each drawn randomly from
the tops of their shuffled decks.

A ROOM CARD INCLUDES:

a Sewer

of the same type.

Entrances and exits always correspond to the nearest half-hex of

dungeon, players can place their figure on any empty hex within
two hexes of the entrance. If the first room has multiple entrances,
players can collectively choose on which entrance to start.

exits: A and B. If players exit a room from an A exit, they must enter the next room from an A entrance and
vice versa with B. If the entrance of the top room in the deck does not match the exit the players used in
the previous room, the top card is discarded until a matching entrance type is found.
If a room has two exits, players may use whichever one they wish, though the one they don’t use is closed
off. If a room has two entrances, players must use the entrance that corresponds to the previous room’s
exit.
•	 Penalties for revealing the room  .
f Whenever a new room is revealed and set up, a penalty may activate
depending on the room and the difficulty decided on by the players. The suggested difficulty is to use
no penalties in the first room, the minor penalty of the second room when it is revealed, and the major
penalty of the third room when it is revealed. Players can decrease or increase the number and severity of
the penalties as they like, up to a point where major penalties are activated for each of the three rooms
when they are revealed. If the character who opened the door is referenced in the penalty of the first
room, players can decide who the penalty targets. If the previous room is referenced in the penalty of the
first room, nothing happens.

“Heading out a little late, aren’t
you?” The guard at the wall looks at
you passively. You grunt in response and head
through the opened gate.

Living Bones

“Nobody’s gonna go looking for your corpse if you
don’t return!” the guard shouts at your back.

You ended up embarking out on the road much
later than you had hoped — events in town saw to
that — but as dusk settles on the horizon you feel
conﬁdent that you are up to any threat you might
face.

071

And then begins the howling of wolves — vicious,
foul beasts — and, judging from their sounds, they
seem to be getting closer.

Option A: Run from the howling to safety.
Option B: Let the wolves come.

Scenario
p.38

You decide to unwind at the
Sleeping Lion, but just as you
are starting to relax, a bear of a man
crashes into your table, scattering your
drinks across the ﬂoor.
Towering over him is a massive Inox. “What
did you say about my horns?” the Inox shouts.
The man stands up and brushes shards of glass
from his tunic. “I said the sight of them makes
me want to vomit!”
The Inox roars and charges headlong into
the man, crashing through more tables in the
process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into
violence. After all, when a man is deep into his
drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that
drink over.
Option A: Join the fray! These insults will not go
unanswered!
Option B: Do your best to stop the ﬁghting. This
is a respectable establishment.
