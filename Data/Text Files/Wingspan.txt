WINGSPAN
a competitive bird-collection, engine-building game for 1-5 players
Designed by Elizabeth Hargrave
Illustrated by Natalia Rojas, Ana María Martínez Jaramillo, and Beth Sobel

You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract
the best birds to your aviary. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats. Each
habitat focuses on a key aspect of the growth of your aviary:
	 •	 Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower
	 •	 Lay eggs using marbled egg miniatures in a variety of colors
	 •	 Expand your bird collection, drawing from hundreds of unique bird cards
The winner is the player with the most points accumulated from birds, bonus cards, end-of-round goals, eggs,
cached food, and tucked birds.

Player Setup

1.	Bird cards. Shuffle the bird cards into a deck. Place it next to
the bird tray, then populate the tray with 3 face-up bird cards.
2.	Supply. Place all food and egg tokens in the supply. These are
tokens accessible to all players.
3.	Birdfeeder. Toss the food dice into the birdfeeder dice tower.
4.	Goal board. Choose which type of goals you will play with,
and place the goal board on the table with that side facing up:
	 i.	
Green: For a game with more direct competition for goals,
choose the side that has 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for each
goal. This is the default.
	 ii.	Blue: For a game with less direct competition between
players, choose the side that awards 1 point for each
targeted item.
5.	Goal tiles. Shuffle the goal tiles without looking at them (they’re
double-sided). Place 1 goal tile (random side up) on each of
the four blank spaces on the goal board. Return extra goal tiles
to the box.
6.	 Bonus cards. Shuffle the bonus cards into a deck and place it
on the table.

A.	Each player receives:
	 •	 1 player mat
	 •	 8 action cubes of one color
	 •	 2 random bonus cards
	 •	 5 random bird cards
	 •	 5 food tokens (1 of each type:

,

,

,

,

)

	You may keep your hand of cards private or public throughout
the game.
B.	Keep up to 5 bird cards and discard the others. For each
bird card you keep, you must discard 1 food token. You will
probably want to keep food tokens shown in the upper left of
the bird cards you selected. For example, you might keep 2
bird cards and 3 food, or you might keep 4 bird cards and 1
food.
C.	Choose 1 bonus card to keep, and discard the other. You may
look at your bonus cards while selecting which birds to keep (and
vice versa).
D.	Randomly select the first player and give them the first-player
token.

This is a detailed rulebook, but you can actually learn the
entire game from the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of
the Appendix). We recommend using that guide if you’re
learning the game in real time with your friends/family.

TIP: When selecting bird cards, think about how they
will help you get more cards or food early in the game.
Brown powers can be especially helpful!

OVERVIEW
Wingspan is played over 4 rounds. During each round, players take turns—proceeding clockwise—until each player has used all of
their available action cubes.

Turn Structure
On your turn, you will take 1 of 4 actions, as shown on the left
side of your player mat:
	
Play a bird from your hand
	
Gain food and activate forest bird powers
	
Lay eggs and activate grassland bird powers
	
Draw bird cards and activate wetland bird powers

DESIGNER’S NOTE: Your first few turns will be very simple
as you work to attract some birds to your aviary. You may
even select the same action multiple times, which is absolutely
allowed! More detailed descriptions of the actions are found
on pages 6-9.

To place a bird from your hand onto a habitat, place an action cube on the Play a Bird spot above where you will play the bird. Pay
the bird’s food and egg cost, then place the bird on your mat, only triggering that bird’s “WHEN PLAYED” power (if any).
The Gain Food, Lay Eggs, and Draw Bird Cards actions follow the same 3-step process (numbers noted on player mat image, below):
1.	Choose a habitat on your player mat and place an action cube on the leftmost exposed slot in that row. Gain the benefit of that slot.
2.	Move your action cube from right to left, activating any birds with a brown “WHEN ACTIVATED” power in that row. Each power
is optional.
3.	When the action cube reaches the far left, leave it there. Your turn is over.

Round Structure
When all players have placed all of their action cubes, the round
is over. Follow these steps in order:
1.	Remove all action cubes from your player mat.
2.	Score the end-of-round goal for the round you just completed.
3.	Discard all face-up bird cards on the bird tray and restock
the bird tray with cards from the deck.
4.	Rotate the first player token clockwise to the next player.

DESIGNER’S NOTE: Players have fewer actions as the game
progresses, but the bird powers create powerful combinations as
birds accumulate in each row of the player mats.

Use 1 of your action cubes to mark your score on the end-ofround goal. As a result, you will have 1 fewer action cube to use
each round:
	 •	 Round 1: 8 turns per player
	 •	 Round 2: 7 turns per player
	 •	 Round 3: 6 turns per player
	 •	 Round 4: 5 turns per player

The game ends at the conclusion of Round 4. Use the scorepad
to add together the following:
	 •	Points for each bird card
(printed on the cards)
	 •	Points for each bonus card
(printed on the cards)
	 •	Points for end-of-round goals
(shown on goal board)
	 •	 1 point for each:
		 »	 egg on a bird card
		 »	 food token cached on a bird card
		 »	 card tucked under a bird card
The player who has the most points wins. In the case of a tie,
the player with the most unused food tokens wins. If players are
still tied, they share the victory.

THE FOUR ACTIONS
Each turn, you will take 1 action. This section describes each action in more detail.

OPTION 1. play a bird from your hand
Before choosing to play a bird from your hand, consider its habitat, food
requirements, and egg cost. Each bird has habitat and food requirements,
shown in the upper left-hand corner of the card. Additionally, there may be an egg cost
shown at the top of the column in which you’re playing the bird (there is no egg cost for
the first column). If you cannot afford to pay the full cost, you cannot play the bird.

When you choose to play a bird, do the following:

habitat
Burrowing Owl

+

food

5

1.	Select a bird card in hand to play and place an action cube at the top of the column in which
you will play the bird. Pay the corresponding egg cost (if any) by discarding eggs from any
birds on your player mat. To play a bird in column 2 or 3, you must discard 1 egg to the egg
supply. In columns 4 or 5, you must discard 2 eggs.

WHEN ACTIVATED: Roll all dice not in
birdfeeder. If any are
, gain
and cache it on this card.

2.	Pay the bird’s food cost. Discard food tokens to the supply (these tokens must be from next to
your player mat, not food tokens cached on bird cards, a concept that will be explained later).
The 5 types of food are:

These owls often use old prairie dog burrows for
their underground nests.

Wild: If a bird’s food requirement
includes a wild icon, you can use
any of the 5 types of food for it.

fruit

Athene cunicularia

rodent

no food: A crossed-out circle
means a bird does not have a
food cost.

8/2/18 2:01 PM

Designer’s Note: These food
types are very generalized.
For example, the symbol for
invertebrates is a caterpillar, but
some invertebrate-eaters specialize
in flying or swimming insects instead
(or shellfish).

 hen playing birds, you may spend any 2 food tokens as if
W
they are any 1 food token. This exchange cannot be used during
other parts of the game. For example, if you need 1 fish, you
could use any other 2 food tokens instead.

3.	Place the bird card on the leftmost exposed slot in its corresponding habitat and move your action
cube to the left side of the PLAY A BIRD row. The three habitats are:
	

forest

grassland

wetland

	If multiple habitat symbols are shown on the bird card, you can choose which habitat (row) to place it in. Your player mat limits you
to a maximum of 5 birds in each habitat.
4.	If the bird has a power that reads, “WHEN PLAYED,” you may use that power. Other powers (in brown and pink) are not used
when the bird is played. Playing a bird is the only action that does not activate a row of birds.

6

OPTION 2. Gain Food and Activate Forest Bird Powers

Food is primarily used to play bird cards. Your options for which food to gain are shown on the dice in the birdfeeder,
which will repeatedly get depleted and refilled throughout the game.

When you choose to gain food, do the following:
1.	Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed slot in the “gain
food” row on your player mat and gain the amount of food
shown from dice you select from the birdfeeder.
	 For each food that you gain:
		 •	Remove a die from the birdfeeder and put it on the table.
		 •	Gain a food token matching the icon on the die and
place it next to your player mat. Your food tokens are
public information.
	You always gain 1 food token per die. With the die face
, gain 1 token of either type (not 2 tokens).
that shows
2.	If the slot where you placed your action cube shows a
card-to-food bonus conversion, you may discard at most 1
bird card from your hand to gain an additional food. This
is optional. When you gain this extra food, you must choose
among the dice that are remaining in the birdfeeder.

3.	Activate any brown powers on your forest birds, from right
to left. All powers are optional. End your turn by placing your
action cube on the left side of the “gain food” row.

Managing the birdfeeder

Managing food tokens

The birdfeeder has a tray to hold the 5 food dice. The dice
removed from the birdfeeder when a player gained food will
remain outside the tray until the birdfeeder is refilled.

There is no limit on how many food tokens you can have by your
mat or on your birds (some bird cards allow you to cache food
tokens on them until the end of the game), nor is there a limit on
food tokens in the supply. In the unlikely event that any type of
food token is unavailable in the supply,
use a temporary substitute.

If the birdfeeder tray is ever empty, throw all 5 dice back in.
If the dice in the tray all show the same face (including if there is
only 1 die) and you are about to gain food for any reason, you
may first throw all 5 dice back into the birdfeeder. (
counts as
its own unique face.)

7

OPTION 3. Lay Eggs and Activate Grassland Bird Powers
Eggs are part of the cost of playing bird cards in columns 2 – 5. Also, each egg on the bird cards on your player mat
is worth 1 point at the end of the game.

When you choose to lay eggs, do the following:

Managing egg tokens

1.	Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed slot in the “lay
eggs” row on your player mat and lay the number of eggs.

There is no limit to the egg supply. In the unlikely event that no
eggs remain in the supply, use a temporary substitute.

	To lay an egg, gain an egg token from the supply (color
doesn’t matter) and place it on a bird card that has space for
it, according to its egg limit. The egg will stay there for the rest
of the game, unless discarded.

Types of nests

You can lay eggs on
any combination of
birds (including all on
1 bird), but each bird
has an egg limit. A bird’s
egg limit is shown by the
egg icons. A bird card can
never hold more than this
number of eggs.

nest
type

Each bird has a nest icon beneath its score. These nest icons can
be important for end-of-round goals and bonus cards. The 4 types
of nests are:

WHEN ACTIVATED: All players lay 1 on

It is possible that you will have more capacity to lay eggs
(based on your player mat) than you have spaces on your
birds. Any excess beyond your egg limit is lost.
BirdCards_r7.indd 55

8/2/18 1:56 PM

2.	If the slot where you placed your action cube shows a foodto-egg bonus conversion, you may pay at most 1 food token
to lay an additional egg. This is optional.

that don’t fit into the four standard types.) These can
be powerful, because they can match any other nest
type for goals and bonus cards.

8/2/18 1:56 PM

Example: Lay 2 eggs, then you may pay 1 food to lay another
egg. Next, you may activate the power on the bird card.
3.	Activate any brown powers on your grassland birds, from
right to left. All powers are optional. End your turn by placing
your action cube on the left side of the “lay eggs” row.

8

Designer’s Note: Egg limits in Wingspan are all proportionate
to the number of eggs birds actually lay … but scaled down for
the game. Birds with a maximum of 6 eggs may actually lay 15
or more eggs in a year!

OPTION 4. Draw Bird Cards and Activate Wetland Bird Powers
The cards available for you to draw are the 3 face-up cards on the bird tray and the top card of the bird deck.

When you choose to draw cards, do the following:
1.	Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed slot in the “draw cards” row on your player mat,
and draw the number of cards there from either the face-up cards on the bird tray or the bird
deck. There is no hand limit.
2.	If the slot where you placed your action cube shows an egg-to-card bonus conversion, you may
discard at most 1 egg from a bird on your mat to draw an additional card. This is optional.
Remove 1 egg from one of your bird cards and return it to the egg supply.

Managing the bird deck

8/2/18 1:56 PM

Designer’s Note: Wingspan
includes 170 of the 914 species of
birds found in North America. The
map at the bottom of each bird card
shows in which continents it lives.

As you draw face-up cards, they are not immediately refilled. Instead, wait until the end of your
turn before refilling empty spaces on the bird tray. If the face-down deck is ever emptied during the
game, reshuffle all discarded bird cards to form a new deck.
At the end of each round, discard any remaining face-up cards and replenish them with 3 new bird
cards.

BIRD POWERS
Powers on bird cards fall into 3 categories:
WHEN ACTIVATED (brown): These powers may be activated from right to left whenever you use the corresponding habitat.
Cache: This refers to putting

discarded cards).

You can only use a pink power
once between each of your
own turns (if an opponent
triggers it). We recommend
telling other players what the
power is, and what activates
it. Players should help each

with a pink power should be
activated.

END OF THE ROUND
When players have placed all their available action cubes (1 cube per turn), the round is over. At round end:
1.	Remove all action cubes from your player mat.
2.	Score the end-of-round goal for the round you just completed.
3.	Discard all face-up bird cards on the bird tray and replenish them.
4.	Rotate the first player token clockwise to the next player.

Scoring End-of-Round Goals
The end-of-round goals are based on how many birds or eggs you have in a given habitat or nest type. To indicate the points you
score from that goal, each player must place an action cube on the goal board (even if you score 0 points). The board has 2 sides,
each using a different scoring method.

If players tie, place both cubes on the tied place, and do not
award the next place. At game end, you will add the points for
that place and the next place(s), then divide by the number of
players who tied and round down (4th place scores 0 points).
For example, when using the goal that scores 5, 2, or 1 points,
if two players tie for 1st place, each gets 3 points (5 + 2 divided
by 2 players, rounded down). Do not award 2nd place to
another player.

Blue: One point per targeted item
