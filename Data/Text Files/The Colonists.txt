When you play this game for the first time, please read the introductory rule book first!

The Epic Strategy Game
The Emperor entrusted you with the task to establish a glorious and prosperous community. To
show the Emperor that his trust in you is not in vain, you send out your trusted steward into the
countryside, instructing him to build residences to attract new colonists into your community.
Recruiting colonists is not enough; you have to create jobs for them as well. Therefore, you should
also build buildings, where the colonists of your community can work. This will require a lot of
resources; so let your steward or your colonists collect them.
With time, duties will become more complex, which is why you should educate your colonists so
they are ready for the tasks at hand. Farmers will turn into citizens which in turn can become
successful merchants.
Establish relations with distant colonies by building embassies in your community; and your
community will be thriving in no time …

Game Objective
Send out your Stewards to collect goods needed for Buildings and valuable Improvements. These create jobs for the Colonists of
your Community. The more Buildings you build and the more Colonists you employ, the more valuable your Community will be.
In the end, the player whose Community is worth the most Dollars wins.

General Notes
A game of The Colonists consists of 4 Eras. You decide in which Era you would like to start and after which Era the game
should end. You may even play through all 4 Eras, and you may stop, and continue the session on another day, if need be. For
a better overview, we use the following labels throughout this rule book:
These indicate rules that only apply to
	 Eras II, III, and IV, respectively.
This indicates rules that only apply if the
specified Colonies are in play
	 (see page 17 and following).

Do not wonder why there is a “IV+” label
instead of just “IV”. Future expansions may
introduce additional Eras …

Everything in this rule book applies to all numbers of players. We assume you start in Era I. Rules for starting in a later Era are
provided at the end of the rule book, on page 23.

Place the Buildings and Storage Facilities 1 at the edge of the playing area (only a few are depicted
here), up to the last Era you are going to play. Return Buildings and Storage Facilities of later Eras to
the game box. The Era is indicated on the tile by a corresponding symbol.
Place the goods 2 at the edge of the playing area. Which types you will need also depends on the
last Era you are going to play. Goods from later Eras are marked accordingly in the illustration below.
Leave the goods you do not need in the game box.

The game board grows as the game progresses. It
represents the mainland and it is comprised of Market
and Place tiles. You determine the layout of the tiles
together, laying out some tiles before the game begins
and the rest during the course of the game (see page 6
or 20).
8 Place the first Market in the center of the playing
area.

Take the starting Places, indicated by a “0” on the back
side, and return the Day Laborer tile to the game box. This Place is only used in the introductory game.
Shuffle the starting Places face down and place the pile nearby. Beginning with the starting player and in clockwise
order, take the topmost starting Place from the pile and add it to the game board. Each Place you add must share at
least two edges with already existing tiles.

Once all 12 starting Places have been placed, the starting player adds the second Market 9 . This Market must share at
least one edge with an existing Place and the shortest path between the two Markets (beeline) must go through at least

Course of Play
The game is played over one or more Eras—depending on how many Eras you decided to play.
At the start of each Era, you have to make some preparations, as described on the corresponding
Era card. Then you play 5 Years, each consisting of 2 Half-Years (i.e. Rounds). In each Half-Year, each
player takes 3 turns. At the end of each Year, you generate goods and distribute your Workers for the
next Year. Also, you may have to sustain your Workers.

Course of Play
Start of an Era:

turn a new era card face up and carry it out
each era consists of 5 years (with 2 half-years each)

Start of a Year:

turn a market card face up
turn three places face up (in years 1 to 4)

Summer Half-Year:

each player takes three consecutive turns

Winter Half-Year:

each player takes three consecutive turns

End of a Year:

In Era II, a third Market is added to the game board, according to the same
placement rules (see the overview card and page 5).
In Era III, you introduce a fifth Colony. If you want to make the game easier on
yourselves, as a variant, also add the small Market to the game board.
In Era IV, you replace the Head Official with the Chief Officer.

This is why you should leave the Era card in the playing area, even after you finish the preparations.

Start of a Year
At the start of each Year, turn over the topmost Market card and place it face up on top of the pile.
Before you do, return the Market card of the previous Year to the game box (if necessary)—it is no
longer needed. The Market card indicates which actions can be taken at the Markets (see page 7).

Note: There are only 12 Places per Era, so the draw pile will be empty
after four Years. In the fifth Year of each Era, there are no more Places
to turn face up—simply skip this step.

The Half-Years

Start of Year:

Now 2 Half-Years are played: a Summer and a Winter Half-Year. Move the Round indicator
to the appropriate space of the Round card at the start of each Half-Year.
Start of Year:

Beginning with the starting player and in clockwise order, each player takes 3 consecutive
turns (see “Your Turn” in the following section). Only after one player completes all of
their three turns, the next player takes theirs. A Half-Year ends after each player had
three turns.
Then you play another Half-Year in the exact same fashion: move the Round indicator to
Winter and let each player take three consecutive turns.

Your Turn
Each player takes three consecutive turns. Each turn starts with moving your Steward from one Place to another and carrying
out the action of the target Place. Special abilities may grant you additional actions on the same turn.
At the start of the game, your Steward is not on the game board yet. Before your first turn, you must place him on a Market
of your choice. This initial placement is not considered a turn so you do not get to carry out a Market action.
Initially, your Steward may only move to adjacent Places, because his Range is 1 at the
start. Each Place is adjacent to up to 6 other Places; Markets are adjacent to up to
8 Places, due to their special shape. (See “Movement Rules” on page 8 for more details.)

Builder

Riverbank Grove

You must carry out an action at the Place to which you move your Steward. It is not
allowed to move to a Place without carrying out an action.

Library

However, you may not be required to carry out the printed action. For
instance, the Lord Colony allows you to carry out an alternative
action at a Place (except on Markets).

The Various Place Types
There are 6 types of Places, each providing a different action:
Markets: Markets have a special role in this game (see “Movement Rules” on page 8), yet they are Places nonetheless.
Each Market provides the same three Market actions from which you must choose one. The available actions change
each Year and are described on the Market card, which is to the right of the Round card:
Sale: The top part of the Market card lets you sell goods, providing two options. You
may use one or both options any number of times. You may only sell goods from your
Storage (see “Storing Rules” on page 10).

or

Subsidy: The middle part shows goods that you may take from the general supply.
Some cards provide two options here. You may only take the offered goods once per
turn. You must immediately store the goods (see “Storing Rules”) or discard them.

or
Builder

Storage Shed

Action: The bottom part offers an action that is usually weaker than the same action at
the corresponding Place (e.g. by having a limit like “1x”).
Resource Places: These Places are indicated by the symbol. They offer certain types
of goods in the indicated quantity. Take these goods from the general supply and store
them (see “Storing Rules”).

Riverbank Grove

Sustainers: These Places are indicated by the symbol. They provide Sustenance
goods (Food and Robes
) or allow you to sell them for Dollars. Every time you
visit them, you may freely choose whether to get Sustenance goods or sell them.
Builders: These Places are indicated by the -symbol. They let you build a new
Building or remodel an existing one (see page 14 for more details).
Unless stated otherwise, you may build any number of Buildings of the given
type during the same turn, provided you can pay the total Building cost from your
Storage (see “Storing Rules”).

The Baker either
gives you 2 Food, or
lets you sell 2 Food
for 1 Dollar any
number of times.

The Riverbank
Grove offers
2 Wood.

or

If there is a limit (like “1x“), you may only build the indicated
number of Buildings of that type.
Refiners: These Places are indicated by the
symbol. They
allow you to refine goods by exchanging basic resources for
refined ones. You may refine any number of goods during the
same turn. However, you may only refine goods that were in
your Storage before the action (see “Storing Rules“).

Builder

Storage Shed

Joiner

Other: These Places provide actions that do not fit in any
other category. They are indicated by the symbol.

You may build at most three Storage Sheds,
which is also how many you may have in
total (see page 14). If you already have one
and take the corresponding Builder action
again, you may only build another two
Storage Sheds.

The Joiner lets you
exchange 2 Wood for
1 Plank any number
of times.

Movement Rules
This section focuses on all the special rules regarding your Steward's movement.
Markets
Usually, you must move your Steward to an adjacent Place and carry out an action there. As mentioned before, Markets play
a special role in this:
Your Steward may jump to a Market, regardless of where he is.
This means, instead of moving your Steward to an adjacent Place, you may move
him directly onto a Market of your choice. The distance traveled does not matter
at all. Simply ignore all the Places on his way to the Market—you do not get to
carry out actions on the way!
Jumping to a Market constitutes a turn and, as such, you must carry out an action
at the Market.
Note: It is always possible to carry out
an action at a Market. If necessary, you
may simply choose the Subsidy action
and decline the goods you are offered.

Storage Shed

In Era II at the earliest (via the Envoy Colony) and in Era III at the latest (via the
Stables Building), you have the opportunity to increase your Steward’s Range (up
to a Range of 4). Range indicates how far your Steward may move, before he must
stop and carry out an action. As soon as you take a Place's action, your Steward’s
movement ends—you may not carry out actions at Places you simply move
through. Your Steward is not required to move in straight lines.

Librarian

Joiner

Riverbank Grove

Diplomat

Example: Your Steward is currently at the Developer. Thanks to an activated Stables, your Range
is 2. On your next turn, you could move your Steward to the Librarian as usual, or you could move
him past the Librarian to the Riverbank Grove or the Diplomat.

Range does not equate to “number of moves”!
If your Steward jumps to a Market, his movement ends immediately and you must carry out an action at that Market,
regardless of your Range.
Note: If your Range is 2 or greater, you may move through a Market. You must only end your movement at the Market
when you jump there.

8

Fee / Moving to Occupied Places
From time to time, the Place you would like to move to will be occupied by other players’ Stewards. It is explicitly allowed to
move to an occupied Place. However, when you do, you must pay a Fee to each player whose Steward is on that Place.
On Markets, you never have to pay the Fee.
Era I
1. Add the second market:
	 at	least	2	places	away	from	first	market
sharing at least one edge with a place

The amount of the Fee depends on the Era you are currently in and is shown on the Era card. It is 1 Tool or 1 Sustenance good
(Food or Robes
) as well as a number of Building resources equal to the number of the current Era. If you must pay more
than one player, you may pay each of them differently. You are not required to pay each player the same goods. If you cannot
pay all the players occupying a Place, you may not move to that Place. (See also “Storing Rules” on page 10 for another detail
regarding paying the Fee.)

The Special Ambassador that you can unlock with certain Colonies may (and often should) also
move to occupied Places (with Stewards or other Special Ambassadors). Special Ambassadors
never require a Fee—neither when they move to an occupied Place nor when you move your
Steward to a Place occupied by a Special Ambassador. (More on Special Ambassadors on page 19.)

Important! “Fee” always refers to the cost shown on the Era card. Usually, you must pay
it when you move to an occupied Place. Some special abilities (that you can unlock with
certain Colonies) require you pay the Fee to activate them.

Certain Improvements and Buildings may reduce or remove the Fee
entirely for you. This does not only affect Fee payments to other players
but also when using a special ability that requires the Fee.

Fee

In Era I at the earliest (via the Envoy Colony) and in Era III at the latest (via the Boardinghouse Building), you can
increase the number of Stewards you control (to up to 4). Like your first Steward, you must introduce every new Steward via a
Market of your choice, before you first move him.
When you have more than one Steward, you must choose one Steward and move him according to the movement rules. Each
turn you may freely choose which Steward you move. You are not required to move the same Steward on all three of your
turns (but you may, if you like). By no means may you move more than one Steward per turn.
Except Markets, no Place may contain more than one Steward of the same player.
Consequently, you may not move a Steward to a Place containing another one of your
Stewards. Markets are exempt from this rule, as usual. You may not circumvent this rule
by paying the Fee either.

Librarian

Each Steward that you move during your 3 turns must end up on a different Place
from where he started. He may return to a Place he has been to within those 3
turns, as long as he ends up elsewhere. As usual, Markets are exempt from this
rule. A Steward that started on a Market, may end up on that same Market.

Especially at the start of the game, you will spend a lot of turns collecting goods, as you will need them to develop your
Community (see “Developing the Community” on page 12). There are four types of goods:

Workers (see “Sustenance Phase” on page 20-21).

Warehouse

Dollars are the currency in this game. You can place them with your Tools in the
Toolbox. Dollars measure the wealth of your Community. Buildings, Improvements,
and Embassies have a printed Dollar value. Additionally, you can collect hard Dollars to
increase the value of your Community. Dollars are not spent in this game.
Razing Buildings

Main sources of basic Building resources are Resource Places and Production Buildings. Smithy
Refiners allow you to exchange Building resources for their refined versions. Sustenance
goods are available at certain Places and via Sustenance Buildings. Tools are generated by
the Smithy on your Community board (see “End of a Year” on page 20), or you can get
them directly at the Developer. Money Buildings yield hard Dollars. (See pages 6-7 of the
Appendix for a detailed list of how you can get each good in particular.)

Storing goods is one of the most important concepts in this game. You do not simply keep your goods loosely in your supply
but you must store Building resources and Sustenance goods. Only Tools and Dollars do not require storing.
There are three ways to store goods: in the Storage (comprised of your Basic Storage and any Storage Facilities you have), in
the Warehouse, and in the Buffers of your Buildings, Improvements, and Embassies.
Storage
At the start of the game, you only have access to 3 Storage spaces in the Basic Storage printed on your Community board.
During the course of the game, you can get access to more Storage spaces by building Storage Facilities. Both, your Basic
Storage and Storage Facilities together constitute your Storage. There are three types of Storage Facilities:
Storage Sheds are available from the start and provide 2 Storage spaces each.

	If the Storekeeper Colony is in play, you may extend your Storage capacity even further
(see Appendix on page 4).
More on Storage Facilities (including how to build them) in the “Buildings” section on page 13 and following.
Warehouse
Your Warehouse consists of that one space below the Building spots for
Storage Facilities, the so-called Warehouse lot. Certain Colonies allow you to
extend your Warehouse by adding Warehouse extensions in the notch next to
your initial Warehouse lot.

Warehouse

Storage Hall (3x)

	If the Altruist, Industrialist, and Storekeeper Colonies are in play, you can extend your Warehouse
to up to 7 Warehouse lots.
Certain Improvements provide additional Warehouse lots. Simply use those cards to store goods in them. The Warehouse
extensions are only used with the above-mentioned Colonies.

Production and Sustenance Buildings (see page 13), which generate goods, can store one batch of goods that they generate.
Simply place the generated goods on the Building. If another effect increases the output of the Building (like Factories, see
page 16), the Building can store additional goods accordingly. Certain Improvements (see page 16) and Embassies (see page
17) have the effect of a Production or Sustenance Building, and so they also have Buffers.
Forester’s House

Example: The Forester’s House generates 2 Wood per Year. This is why it
can store 2 Wood in its Buffer, meaning you can keep 2 Wood on the tile.

Storing Goods
Whenever you get goods, you must either decline or store them immediately, placing them on Storage
spaces or Warehouse lots—but not in the Buffers of your Buildings, Improvements, or Embassies.

Storage Shed (3x)

You may discard goods at any time for no reason.
In particular, you may discard goods from your Storage and Warehouse to make
room for new goods. Conversely, you may decline any goods that you get, without
the need to store them first. Discarding goods from Buffers never makes any sense.
Warehouse

Using Goods
One of the most important rules in this game is the following:
During actions, you may only spend goods from your Storage!
Whenever you have to pay goods during an action (e.g., when building, refining goods, or paying the Fee), you must take
them from your Storage (i.e. Basic Storage and Storage Facilities). When you refine goods, you spend the input goods first,
before you take the refined goods.
Your Warehouse and Buffers are not part of your Storage!
During actions, you may not spend goods from your Warehouse or (Building, Improvement, and Embassy) Buffers. However,
immediately before you carry out the action, you may rearrange goods.
Rearranging Goods
At any time—except during an action—you may rearrange your goods, i.e. move them between the three storing options
according to certain rules. The following diagram shows the permitted “directions” in which you may move goods:
Warehouse

Storage

Buffers

You may move goods back and forth between your Storage and Warehouse without any additional restrictions. You may even
swap two or more goods (especially when both your Storage and Warehouse are full).

1 Wood in your Basic Storage and 2 Clay in a Storage Shed. Your Warehouse
contains 1 Wood. You would like to use the Joiner to produce 2 Planks.
Immediately before the action, you swap 1 Clay in your Storage with the Wood
in your Warehouse. Then you discard 2 Food from your Storage, replacing them
with the 2 Wood from the Forester’s House. Now you have 4 Wood in your
Storage so you can produce 2 Planks at the Joiner.

What Is Considered an Action?
Warehouse
Basically, carrying out a Place’s action is considered one action—regardless of how many
micro-transactions were made in the
process. For instance, it does not matter how many Buildings are built at a Builder—the action starts with building the first
and ends with building the last Building. The same applies to Refiners.

In terms of the storing rules, paying the Fee is considered an action of its own; it is never part of another action. You must
complete this action before you may carry out the Place’s action (or special ability). If you must pay multiple players, you must
pay all of them simultaneously, i.e. you may not rearrange goods in-between the individual payments. Only after you pay all
Warehouse
affected players, the action ends.
	The Institute Building allows you to play two Improvements instead of one. Playing the
second Improvement is an action of its own. This means, in particular, that you benefit from
the effects of the first Improvement while you play the second.

INSTITUTE (1X)

 	Certain Colonies may grant you additional actions during your turn or at the end of the Year. If you get multiple
actions at the same time, you decide in which order you carry them out. An action must be completed before you
can rearrange goods and carry out the next action.
Sustaining your Workers is not subject to the storing rules!
Sustaining your Workers is not an action. Usually, you must sustain your Workers at the end of the Year (see “Sustenance
Phase” on pages 20-21). Activating a Building may also require Sustenance (see “Activating a Building” on page 15).

Developing the Community
You use the goods that you collect to develop your Community, which you can do in three categories: Buildings,
Improvements, and Diplomacy.

Buildings and Employment
The Buildings are the heart of the game. Your goal is to build as many as you can and place Workers in them. In the end, this
will be worth a lot of Dollars. Plus, they provide useful effects.

12

There are 6 different types of Buildings:
Residences: They provide new Colonists that you can employ in your Buildings (see “Colonists
and Workers” below). You start the game with two Farms; each Farm provides a Farmer.
Residences are indicated by the symbol as well as a beige icon.

Farm

Storage Shed (3x)

Storage Facilities: You store goods in them that you may use during actions (see “Storing
Rules”). Storage Facilities are indicated by the symbol as well as a blue icon.
Production Buildings: Once per Year, these Buildings generate goods, saving you valuable turns,
because you will not have to collect as many goods yourself. Your Community board comes with
a preprinted Smithy that generates Tools. Production Buildings are indicated by the symbol
as well as a brown icon.

Forester’s House

Sustenance Buildings: Once per Year, these Buildings generate Sustenance goods (Food and
Robes
). Especially in later Eras, you will need them to sustain your Workers. Sustenance
Buildings are indicated by the symbol as well as a purple icon.
Money Buildings: Once per Year, these Buildings generate Dollars. Money Buildings are indicated by
the symbol as well as a golden icon.

Hunting Lodge

Pub

Special Buildings: This category is for all Buildings that do not fit in any of the other categories.
Special Buildings are indicated by the symbol as well as a white icon.

LIBRARY (1X)

Colonists and Workers
Residences draw new Colonists into your Community: Farms and Estates provide Farmers; Flats and Apartments
provide Citizens; Houses
and the Community Hall
provide Merchants
. (More on that on page 15)
Colonists do you no good until you employ them in your Buildings, turning them into Workers (see “Activating a Building” on
page 15). This is not only worth a lot of Dollars at the end of the game, but it is also necessary so that your Buildings actually
do something. Most Buildings (including the Storage Facilities) do nothing until someone works in them. Depending on which
Worker a Building requires, you may put them in the following categories:
Farmer Buildings: They only do something when a Farmer works there, as indicated by the illustration at
the bottom left of the Building and the green background color. Citizens and Merchants
may not work in
Farmer Buildings.
Citizen Buildings: These require a Citizen, as indicated by the corresponding illustration at the bottom left
and the yellow background color. Farmers and Merchants
may not work in Citizen Buildings.
Merchant Buildings
: These Buildings are only available from Era III onward. They require a Merchant to
work there, as indicated by the corresponding illustration and the red background color. Farmers and Citizens
may not work in Merchant Buildings.
Other: Residences as well as the Factory and Library are special in this regard. Residences provide
potential Workers; they do not need any. The Library works without any Worker; and the Factory can
take any type of Worker.
This means for the Storage Facilities in particular: you only gain access to the additional Storage spaces when you employ
the appropriate Colonist in them! Your Basic Storage and Warehouse (as well as the preprinted Smithy) do not require any
Workers.

After you pay the total building cost from your Storage, you must place the new Buildings on
empty Building spots of your Community board. At the start of the game, you have access to
20 Building lots (or just 12, if you only play Era I), of which two are already occupied by a Farm.
You may not build on the dark Borderland spots. Additionally, you have 3 Building spots for
Storage Facilities, which you may use to build normal Buildings instead. The Building spots for
Storage Facilities are the only ones on which you may place Storage Facilities.
	From Era III onward, you may build the
Community Hall to gain access
to all 30 Building spots, including the
Borderland spots.

Farm

_

Details on razing:
You may raze Buildings at any time, even if you have empty Building spots left!
Remodeling Buildings (see next section) does not count as razing!
Razing increases the Building cost of the new Building (these are the 2 additional Tools you have to pay).
You may only raze a Residence if all of its Colonists are “at home”, i.e. you must have enough unemployed Colonists left
(where they live exactly does not matter). You lose these Colonists together with the Residence.
If you raze a Storage Facility, you may use the goods in that Facility to pay the Building cost of the replacing Building,
before you must return the Storage Facility to the general supply. You may rearrange or discard leftover goods.
If you raze a Production or Sustenance Building, you may rearrange the goods in their Buffers, before you must return
the Building to the general supply. If you do not have enough space in your Storage and Warehouse, you must discard
these or other goods.
If you raze a Building with a Worker present, the Worker becomes unemployed and returns, as a normal Colonist, to his
Residence. You may activate the new Building immediately (but you may have to pay the Sustenance cost, see page 16).
Although rarely reasonable, you may raze a Building only to replace it with the exact same Building (e.g., replace a
Library with a Library).
Remodeling
Some Buildings are upgrades to existing Buildings and are not simply placed on empty Building spots.
Instead, they replace the upgraded Building, as indicated at the corresponding Builders.

Builder

Almost all of the Residences are prime examples of that: Farms are the only Residences built
directly; every other Residence is an upgrade of another.
Farm

Flat

14

There are two directions in which you can upgrade Residences:
Estate

You increase the number of Colonists it provides. In this
case, you turn the tile to the other side and place the
additional Colonists on it. This is possible even if the
Residence is empty (because its Colonist is employed
somewhere).
You replace the Colonist with a “better” version. For
this, the Colonist must be “at home”, i.e. you must have
an unemployed Colonist of the appropriate type left
(somewhere—it does not matter where he lives at the
moment). Replace the Colonist and the tile with the
new versions.
Note: Only at the end of a Year may you remove
employed Colonists from Buildings (see “Redistributing
Colonists” on page 20).

) are effectively Residences: they provide
Certain Improvements (“Holiday Cabin”, “Holiday Flat”, and “Holiday House”
additional Colonists without costing you valuable Building spots. These Improvements cannot be remodeled. Building
Contracts (i.e. certain immediate Improvements) that allow you to build Residences, on the other hand, work like Builders.
They may require you to remodel an existing Residence, for which a Colonist must be “at home”.
	From Era II onward, you may remodel other types of Buildings as well, replacing them with stronger versions
of themselves (e.g., so they can generate or store more goods). The stronger versions, however, require a
“better” type of Worker be employed. This in turn renders the previous Worker unemployed, so he returns to his
Residence.
Example: If you remodel a Storage
Shed into a Storage House, you
increase your Storage capacities
by three Storage spaces. However,
the Storage Shed was run by a
Farmer who must now return to an
appropriate Residence. In order to
get access to the 5 Storage spaces
of the Storage House, you must
employ a Citizen in it.

Some Improvements are effectively Production and Sustenance Buildings. These Improvements

127

Activating a Building
As you have already learned in the “Colonists and Workers” section, most Buildings require a Worker to actually do
something. Normally, you want this to happen as soon as possible:
At any time, you may activate a Building by placing the required Worker in it.
Whenever you build a new Building, regardless of whether you build it directly or by remodeling,
you may immediately move an unemployed Colonist (of the appropriate type) from a Residence
to the new Building. The effects of that Building become available immediately.

Farm

Forester’s House

Note: Do not activate Production, Sustenance, and Money Buildings (or the Factory)
immediately. Do this at the end of the Year when it matters—see “Redistributing Colonists”
on page 20.
	The Institute is the only Building in this game requiring 2 Farmers to activate, i.e. you must place 2 Farmers in
it, before you can use its effects. (As long as no or only one Worker works there, it does not have any effect.)
When you place Citizens or Merchants

in Buildings, you must immediately sustain them.

15

This means that you must immediately pay the Sustenance cost for the newly placed Worker
(see also “Sustenance Phase on pages 20-21):

You may pay the Sustenance cost from any of the three storage options, because sustaining

Example: You build a Stables
to increase your Range. You need the increased Range
as soon as possible, so you place an unemployed Merchant
in the Stables
. You must
immediately pay 2 Food and 1 Robe
. You pay one Food from a Hunting Lodge and
another from your Storage, and the Robe from your Warehouse.

Note: Even though you just sustained the Worker, you
House
STABLES (1X)
will have to sustain him again at the end of the Year, if
_
he remains in the Building! This is why you should not
immediately activate Buildings that only do something
at the end of a Year, in order to avoid paying the
Sustenance cost twice.
Removing Workers from Buildings is strictly controlled!

Warehouse

You may activate Buildings at any time, but you may not remove Workers from them (e.g., to send a Worker “home” so you
can remodel a Residence). This is only possible at the end of each Year (see “Redistributing Colonists” on page 20).
The Factory
The Factory is the only Building in this game that may be run by any type of Worker (Farmer, Citizen, or
Merchant
). Its effect depends on who is working in it: The Factory increases the output of all of your
Production and Sustenance Buildings that are run by the same type of Worker as the Factory by 1 good.
Permanent Improvements that generate goods (e.g. the “Beaver’s Lodge”) do not require any Workers, so
Factories do not affect them.
Example: You have a Factory and two Forester’s
Houses run by Farmers as well as a Factory run by a
Citizen. Consequently, your Forester’s Houses generate
3 Wood per Year. The Factory with the Citizen does not
affect that.

Improvements and Hand Cards
Aside from Buildings, Improvements are another way to gain special abilities. There are three types of
Improvements:
Immediate: When you play an immediate Improvement, immediately carry out its effects; then place it
on the discard pile. These cards are indicated by the symbol.

Stone Axe

You made yourself a stone
axe to cut some wood:
unfortunately, it didn’t last very long.

The “Stone Axe” provides an immediate 4 Wood that you must store or discard.

101

Permanent: When you play a permanent Improvement, pay its cost and place it face up in front of
you. These cards have a Dollar value and provide a permanent effect. Some of them provide the
same effects as certain Buildings; even though they do, Improvements in general do not require any
Workers. Permanent Improvements are indicated by the symbol.
Loam Hollow

The “Loam Hollow” generates 1 Clay per Year. Even though it does the
exact same thing as the Hollow, it does not require a Worker.

Limited: These cards can only be used a limited number of times, before you must discard them.
When you play a limited Improvement, place it face up in front of you and place the depicted goods
from your Storage on the card. Every time you use the effect of that card, you must return one of its
goods to the general supply. Once all goods have been removed, place the card on the discard pile.
Limited Improvements are indicated by the symbol.

Loam Hollow

When you play the “Ticket”, you must place 3 Wood from your Storage on the card. Up to three
times during the course of the game, you may spend 1 Wood from the “Ticket” as well as an
additional 2 Wood from your Storage to move your Steward to any Place on the game board.

Drawing Improvements
At the start of the game, you do not have any Improvements in your hand. To get some, you must move to
the Librarian, where you get 2 Improvements from the draw pile into your hand. (If the draw pile runs
out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.)

Librarian

You may not have more than 6 cards in hand!
So if you have 5 cards in hand already and move to the Librarian, you may only draw one new Improvement. Exceeding
the hand size limit is not allowed. As long as you have 6 cards in hand, you may not use the Librarian at all.
You may not discard cards from hand!
The only way to get rid of cards from your hand is to play them (see “Playing Improvements” below). It is possible that you get
stuck with cards in your hand that you cannot play any longer (e.g., because you cannot meet their requirements).
Both of these rules can be (partially) disabled by the Library and the Scholar
Colony. Their special abilities allow you to exceed the hand size limit for a brief
moment. Even with 6 cards in hand, you could still use the Librarian. If you do,
you must reduce your hand size to 6 cards immediately afterward by discarding cards
from hand unused.

Scholar

LIBRARY (1X)

Embassy

The Library and the Scholar Colony also enhance the Librarian action for
you: you get 4 cards from the draw pile, from which you may keep two, discarding
the other two. Only after keeping cards, do you check your hand size.
Playing Improvements
You can play your hand cards at the Developer. First, you get 2 Tools; then you must play a card from
your hand. (It is not allowed to just take the 2 Tools and not play a card.) If the card shows a cost at the
top, you must pay it, before you may carry out its effect.

Developer

	 Once you improve your relations with the Scholar Colony to level II, you may also play
an Improvement every time you draw cards at the Librarian.
	With an active Institute, you may play 2 Improvements at the Developer,
one after another. Playing more than 2 Improvements in one turn is (currently)
not possible.

INSTITUTE (1X)

Depending on which type of card you play, you must either place the card face up in front of you (if it is
permanent or limited) or carry out its effects and place it on the discard pile (if it is immediate).
	By the way, it does not matter which Era the card you play belongs to. You may play cards
from earlier Eras.
Clay Oven

Like most Market actions, the actions you get from Improvements may be limited.

You thought it’d be a good idea to burn
some bricks in your clay oven: wrong.

Diplomacy

113

A third way to develop your Community and to gain special abilities is to establish diplomatic relations with distant Colonies.
There are 9 different and unique Colonies; only 4 (or 5 from Era III onward) of them are available each game. Depending on
the Eras you play through, you can establish relations with each Colony on up to 4 levels, gaining powerful special abilities in
the process.
There are the following Colonies:
Alchemist Colony: You gain the ability to exchange goods for other goods the moment
you get them. In Era II, the Alchemist
Special Ambassador comes into play.
Altruist Colony: At the start of each Year, you get goods for free. In Era II, the Altruist
Special Ambassador comes into play.
Envoy Colony: You get another Steward as well as increased Range.
Industrialist Colony: At the end of each Year, you may refine goods.

This means, in particular, you may raze an Embassy (by paying an additional 2 Tools as usual). If you do, you immediately lose
all special abilities the corresponding Colony granted you. You may lose additional components in the process.
Improving Relations
You can improve an existing relation with a Colony (during the same or a later action)
by paying the cost of the next higher level. Turn the Embassy tile to the other side
(when going from level I to II, or level III to IV) or exchange it with the other one,
placing it accordingly (when going from level II to III).

You may only improve relations up to the level that is equal to the current Era number!
For instance, in Era II, you may only improve relations up to level II. For your convenience, this is described on the Era card.
Note: In a single action, you may establish any number of new relations as well as improve any number of existing
relations. You may even improve relations that you just established during that action. However, note that this is a single
action so you must have all the required goods in your Storage before the action.

Special Ambassadors
In Era II, the Alchemist, Altruist, and Laborer Colonies introduce Special Ambassadors of the same name—the
Alchemist, Altruist, and Laborer, respectively. Once you improve your relations with these Colonies to level II (or higher),
you may move the corresponding Special Ambassadors once per Half-Year, in addition to your Steward’s movement. Each
of the Special Ambassadors' moves is printed on the corresponding Colony overview and will be mentioned in this section
as well.
General rules:
Like Stewards, the Special Ambassadors enter the game board via Markets. The first player to unlock a Special
Ambassador must immediately place him on a Market of their choice.
Special Ambassadors are subject to the same movement rules as Stewards, except they do not pay the Fee. In particular,
Special Ambassadors may jump to Markets, and placing them on a Market for the first time is not considered their movement.
Special Ambassadors have an intrinsic Range of 2. You can increase their Range in the same ways you can increase it for
your Steward (e.g. via an activated Stables
).
All players “share” the same Special Ambassador figures. You may talk with each other and agree upon where the
Special Ambassadors should be. You do not have to honor such agreements though.
Details on the Special Ambassadors:

Librarian

Alchemist: You may move the Alchemist at the start or end of one of
your three turns. If you move the Alchemist to a Place with at least
one other player’s Steward on it, you may immediately carry out
that Place’s action, as though you moved there with your Steward.

Altruist:	You may move the Altruist at the start of one of your three turns. The Altruist grants you a discount on all of your
actions, if he is at a Place that is providing goods unconditionally, including all Resource Places, Markets (due to the Subsidy
action), and Sustainers. (The Developer is not included, because he does not provide 2 Tools unconditionally.) The amount
of the discount is equal to the number of goods provided by the Place with the Altruist.
Examples: You have unlocked the Altruist who is at the Grove, providing a discount of
up to 3 Wood on all of your actions.

Riverbank Forest

(1) You build a Farm, normally costing 1 Tool and 2 Wood. Thanks to the Altruist, you
only have to pay 1 Tool.

Warehouse

replaces a
Riverbank Grove

(2) You produce 4 Planks at the Joiner. Normally, this would cost 8 Wood. Due to the
Altruist, you only have to pay 5 Wood.

The Altruist does not only reduce Building costs; he can also reduce your Sustenance demand during the Sustenance phase, if
he is at a Sustainer (or Market with the appropriate Subsidy action). (See “Sustenance Phase” on page 21 for examples.)
Relations to the Alchemist Colony have no impact on the Altruist discount. The Altruist provides exactly
what is printed on the Place he is at.
Laborer: You may move the Laborer at the end of your third turn. You will only benefit
from him on another player’s turn. Every time another player spends goods at the Place
(Market included) where the Laborer currently is at, you get 1 good of each type spent—
except Tools.

Starting Player
As the starting player, you go first and, at the end of every Year, you may add the new
Places to the game board. The starting player is indicated by the starting player marker.
Head Official

The starting player does not change automatically. To become starting player, you must either
move to the Head Official or take the corresponding Market action (if it is available).
When you do, take the starting player marker. However, you do not become starting player
immediately—the Year (especially the Winter Half-Year) must be finished in the current order.
Until it does, the starting player marker may change hands multiple times! Only at the end of the
Year, the current holder of the starting player marker becomes the actual starting player (see “End
of a Year” below).

Chief Officer

	At the start of Era IV, the Head Official is replaced with the Chief Officer. There you
still get the starting player marker. Additionally, you may swap any two unoccupied Place tiles.
Aside from the starting player marker, the Head Official also provides 1 Clay from the general supply
(the Chief Officer
provides 1 Tool and 1 Dollar instead). At the start of Era I, the Head Official is the only source
of Clay (unless the current Market card provides Clay). During the course of Era I, additional Clay Resource Places will become
available.

End of a Year
After each player had three consecutive turns twice (namely once per Half-Year), you must go through the following 5 phases
in the given order. The Year ends after those phases.
1. New Starting Player

Builder
Clay Delve

	 The current holder of the starting player marker becomes
starting player. This may be the same player who was
starting player last Year, if no other player has taken the
starting player marker from them.
2. Adding New Places (not in the 5th Year of an Era)
	 The starting player now adds the three face-up Places (see “Start
of a Year” on page 6) to the game board, according to the same
rules during setup: each new Place must share at least two
edges with an already existing tile.
	Replacement Places: Some Places are not simply added
to the game board; instead, they replace an already
existing Place. These Places state which Place they replace.
Remove the replaced tile from play and position the
replacing one on the same spot. If a Place is to be replaced
of which there are multiple copies (like the Riverbank
Grove), the starting player may choose which copy to
replace.

3. Redistributing Colonists
	 Now you may redistribute all of your Colonists among all of your Residences and other Buildings. This is only allowed
in this phase! If you wish to remodel your Residences next Year, now is the time to send some Colonists back “home”.
Note: If you remove a Colonist from a Building that has goods left in its Buffer, you must move those goods to your
Storage or Warehouse, or discard them.
Important! In this phase, you do not need to sustain your Workers. This is done in the following phase—
the Sustenance phase. You still have to make sure that you can sustain all of your Workers.
4. Sustenance Phase
In this phase, your Sustenance Buildings generate goods and you must sustain your Workers. Colonists in Residences
are not considered Workers—so they do not require sustaining. Proceed as follows:

20

a. First, determine your Sustenance demand, i.e. the sum of the Sustenance costs of all of your Workers (not
unemployed Colonists). Your Community board and the following table tell you which and how many goods are
required per Worker:

Worker

Food

Farmer

Robes

–

Citizen

1

Merchant

2

If you only play through Era I, Farmers are usually
the only Workers you have; and they do not require
sustaining. Once you start employing Citizens in
Factories towards the end of the game, you will
have to worry about sustaining them.

–
–
1

Once you determine your Sustenance demand, you may spend
Sustenance goods from your Storage, Warehouse and Sustenance
Building Buffers (including certain Embassies and Improvements)
to lower the Sustenance demand.
 

Farmers sustain
themselves—
you do not
have to sustain
them.

	If your relations to the Altruist Colony are at least on level II, the
Altruist Special Ambassador can lower your Sustenance demand even
further, if he is at a Place providing Sustenance goods. If he is, your
Sustenance demand is reduced by the amount of goods provided by
that Place. Neither value can be less than 0.

Hunting Grounds

STABLES (1X)

THEATER
Baker

or

Example: You have 2 Citizens and 1 Merchant
working in your Buildings. Therefore, your Sustenance demand
is 4 Food and 1 Robe
. If you unlocked the Altruist  
, your Food demand would drop to 2 Food, because
the Altruist is at the Baker, providing 2 Food.

b. Next, determine your Sustenance capacity, i.e. the sum of all Sustenance goods generated by your
Sustenance Buildings (including certain Improvements and Embassies).
Example: In the above example, your Sustenance capacity is 3 via the
Hunting Grounds. If you also had the “Vegetable Garden” Improvement,
your Sustenance capacity would be a total of 4.

Vegetable Garden
Are you ready for a vegan diet?

c. Finally, compare the two values:
If your demand is greater than your capacity, you did not lower your Sustenance demand
enough, so you must pay the missing Sustenance goods from your Storage, Warehouse, or
Sustenance Building Buffers (including certain Improvements and Embassies).

125

Important! If you notice at this point that you cannot sustain all of your Workers, you must repeat the
“Redistributing Colonists” and “Sustenance” phases until you can sustain all of your Workers.
Example: In the above example, you generate fewer Robes
(0) than you need (1). Without the help of the Altruist  
“Vegetable Garden” you would also lack Food (you need 4, but you only generate 3).

, and the

If your demand is lower than your capacity, your Sustenance Buildings produce more than you need. Distribute the
surplus goods between your Sustenance Buildings (with regard to their Buffer sizes, see page 11), or place them in your
Storage and Warehouse. Discard the excess, if need be.
Example: In the above example, with the help of the Altruist 

, you would have a Food surplus (you need 2, but you would generate 3). 

If both values are equal, nothing happens. You have successfully sustained your Workers, without generating any
surplus.
Important! Your Sustenance demand and Sustenance capacity are applied against each other. You do not
generate Sustenance goods first and then sustain your Workers. Both things happen simultaneously. This
is especially important when the Buffers of your Sustenance Buildings are full.

21

The Balance Card
Your Balance card is there to help you keep track of your Sustenance demand and capacity or, more
specifically, of the difference between the two. Use a Food and Robes
marker to track that
difference. Every time you put a new Citizen or Merchant
to work, move the Food and Robes
marker back by the appropriate number of spaces. Every time you activate a new Sustenance Building
(or play a corresponding Improvement or build a corresponding Embassy), move the markers forward
accordingly. (When you deactivate a Sustenance Building, you must move the markers back again.)
This way you will always know at a quick glance whether or not you are currently capable of sustaining
your Workers. If the spaces on the track do not suffice, use additional markers to indicate the over-/
underflow.
5. Production Phase
In this phase, your Money and Production Buildings generate goods, including the
preprinted Smithy on your Community board, which generates Tools. Place any
produced Tools and Dollars in the Toolbox on your Community board. If possible, place
any produced Building resources on the Production Buildings that generated them (with
regard to their Buffer sizes, see page 11). If there is not enough room on the Buildings,
place the goods in your Storage and Warehouse. If need be, discard the excess.

Game End and Scoring
The game ends at the end of the last agreed-upon Era. Then score your Communities:
Add up the Dollar values of all of your Buildings and Embassies as well as your (permanent) Improvements.
Add to this number the Dollars you collected in your Toolbox throughout the game.
Finally, add to this number the value of your Workers. Unemployed Colonists sitting in
their Residences are worthless. The following table tells you how many Dollars each
Worker provides:

Use the scoring pad provided with this game to compute your score (it also shows the above
values). The player whose Community is worth the most Dollars wins. In case of a tie, the
initial turn order at the start of the game breaks ties: the later you took your first three turns
the better. Otherwise (or if you cannot recall the initial turn order), there are multiple winners.

Example: At the end of the game,
you have 6 Farms, 2 Flats, 2 Factories,

Sheds. These Buildings are worth a
total of 30 Dollars. You also have
played the “Beaver’s Lodge” and
“Loam Hollow” Improvements for
another 3 Dollars. You have 6 hard
Dollars in your Toolbox. On top of
these 39 Dollars, you must add the
value of your Workers. All but one of
your 6 Farmers are employed—this
is worth 10 Dollars. Both of your
Citizens work—this is another
12 Dollars. In total, your Community
is worth 61 Dollars.

Starting in a later Era
You do not have to start this game in Era I necessarily. You can start in any Era, if you like (even in Era IV). If you start in
another Era but Era I, there are some changes to the setup of the game. Lay out all the components that you need (including
the Colonies). Then play the following five phases, which are basically slightly adjusted versions of the “End of a Year” phases:

Phase 1: Starting Player

Determine a starting player.

Phase 2: Game Board
Beginning with the starting player and in clockwise order, set up the game board using the Places of all Eras prior to the Era
you want to start in. The procedure is the same as during the setup of Era I. Lay out the Places (and replace them, if required)
Era by Era. Before you start laying out the Places of the next Era, perform the first step of the Era card of that Era (e.g., place
the second and third Market, introduce a fifth Colony, and replace the Head Official with the Chief Officer).

Phase 3: Personal Display
Each player gets 1 random permanent Improvement from each skipped Era. Place these Improvements face up in front
of you—they are considered played. You do not have to pay their Building costs. Additionally, each player gets 2 random
Improvements from the last skipped Era into their hand.
Example: You start in Era IV. Each player gets 1 permanent Improvement from Eras I, II, and III, which they place face up in front of them, as
well as 2 Improvements from Era III into their hand.

Next, decide which Buildings, Embassies, and goods you want to start with. In each category, you get a certain amount
of Dollars that you can spend. You may choose any Buildings, Embassies, and Goods up to the last skipped Era. The three
columns in the middle of the following table show how many Dollars you may spend in each category. (This and the next table
are also printed on one of the overview cards.)

Buildings

Goods

If you want to avoid that certain Players
only place Money Buildings on their
Community board (which is a little boring),
you may require each player place at most
3 Money Buildings during setup.

The Embassy values also indicate Dollars, i.e. pay attention to the printed Dollar values on the Embassy tiles you place.
You may spend any or all of your Embassy Dollars as Building Dollars!
Example: You start in Era III. You only need an Embassy of level I, which is worth 2 Dollars. You may spend the remaining 6 Dollars on
Buildings. In total, you may spend 59+6=65 Dollars on Buildings.

After you placed all of the Buildings and Embassies you want, place Colonists into your Residences and immediately put them
to work in your other Buildings. You will have to sustain your Workers in the next phase.
Then spend your Goods Dollars. During scoring, goods are not worth any Dollars, but if you start in a later Era, each good is
assigned a Dollar value during setup—for this purpose only!
You may add any remaining Building Dollars to your Goods Dollars!
The following table shows how many Dollars each good is worth during setup, as well as when each goods type is available for
purchase:
Goods

Avaliable from Era

Dollars
1
2
3
3
6

Additionally, each player gets 1 Food (regardless of which goods
you spent your Goods Dollars on), as well as the number of Tools
shown in the other table. You cannot spend Goods Dollars on
Tools. Place your goods in your Storage and Warehouse.
Note: If need be, you may even place goods in the Buffers of
your Buildings (which is only allowed during setup!). This only
makes sense for Sustenance Buildings, though, because your
Production Buildings will all generate goods in phase 5.

23

Phase 4: Sustenance Phase
Proceed with a regular Sustenance Phase. If you notice that you cannot sustain your Workers, repeat phase 3 until you can.
Not sustaining your Workers is still not allowed!

Phase 5: Production Phase
Finally, play the Production Phase as usual (including the Smithy).
Now you are ready to go!

Saving the Game
The Colonists allow you to save the current game state and continue playing at a later point in time. To do so, you must quit
the game just before the “End of a Year” phases at the end of the fifth Year!
Proceed with a simplified scoring. Use the scoring pad to write down your Building and Embassy Dollars as well as the Dollars
in your Toolbox. You do not need to score your Improvements or Workers. Instead, write down the following things:
the total Dollar value of your goods, except Dollars
(according to the table on page 23)

Of course, you are not playing the
exact same game this way. If you
really want to continue where you
left off, you should take a photo.

the number of Tools in your Toolbox
the permanent Improvements you played
the number of cards in your hand

Alternatively, put your goods, tools, and the (permanent) Improvements you played in a plastic bag with the components in
your color. The starting player should also put the starting player marker into their bag.
Also take note of the Colonies in play as well as which Era is up next.
When you wish to continue the game, proceed as described in “Starting in a Later Era” (see page 23), with the following
changes:
Colonies: Lay out the Colony overviews and Embassies of the noted Colonies.
Improvements: Restore the permanent Improvements you played according to your notes. Then draw the noted
number of random Improvements into your hand. You may choose between all Improvements of all Eras prior to the one
that is next up.
Community board: Spend the Building and Embassy Dollars on the scoring pad to set up your Community board, instead
of the values provided in the table on page 23. Take goods and Tools according to your notes or from your plastic bag.
You do not get any additional Food or Tools! However, restore the Dollars in your Toolbox according to the scoring pad.
Do not forget to play the Sustenance and Production phase!
Have fun!
