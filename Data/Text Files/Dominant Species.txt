I ntro d u ctio n
90,000 B.C. — A great ice age is fast approaching.
Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal
species.
Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates
a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the
living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing
earth.
Each player will assume the role of one of six major
animal classes—mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian,
arachnid or insect. Each begins the game more or less
in a state of natural balance in relation to one another.
But that won’t last: It is indeed “survival of the fittest”.

Through wily action pawn placement, players will
strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card
effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for
their particular animal. Players will be aided in these
endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation
actions, among others.
All of this eventually leads to the end game – the final
ascent of the ice age – where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal
crowned the Dominant Species.
But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it’s getting mighty cold….

Game overview
The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to
create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might
have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles – converting
them into tundra in the process – as the ice age encroaches.
The cylindrical action pawns (or “AP”s) drive the game.
Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions
that can be taken—such as speciation, environmental
change, migration or glaciation. After being placed on the
action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the
Execution Phase.
Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own
animal’s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents’—hopefully collecting valuable
victory points (or “VP”s) along the way. The various cards
will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.

Throughout this booklet you will see numerous shaded
boxes such as this one. These boxes are filled with examples,
clarifications, play hints, design notes, and other assorted
wisdom in order to help ease you along.

Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to,
moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the
“earth”). Element disks will be added to and removed from
both animals and earth.
When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring
of each tile—after which the player controlling the animal
with the highest VP total wins the game.

Dominant Species

Glossary

Endangered—Any species in play on a tile wherein none
of that tile’s elements match those of the player’s animal (or
if the tile is devoid of elements altogether).

Action Pawns (APs)—The set of wooden cylinders that players will use each turn to mark the
actions they wish to perform.
Animal—Mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect. One of the six animal classes that each player will be
representing throughout the game. Each animal class is represented on earth by a set of like-colored species cubes. Each
animal has an animal display and an initiative marker.

Food Chain
Food Chain—Used to break ties
when scoring a tile during a Domination action, among other things.
In top-down order – best-to-worst –
the food chain is:
●●
●●
●●
●●
●●
●●

Bonus
VPs— Bonus Points Table
Some actions
Quantity: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9+
and card efVictory points: 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45
fects call for a
player to earn
“bonus VPs”. To earn bonus VPs, refer to the Bonus Points
Track located in the bottom left of the game board. The top
row of the Bonus Points Track lists the count that the action
or card effect is checking – for example, how many tundra
tiles are occupied by an animal during the Survival action
(see page 20) – while the square directly below this number
in the bottom row gives the amount of VPs gained based
on that count.
Dominance Cards—The set of 26
cards that a player will choose from
whenever a tile is scored where their
animal is dominant. Dominance
Cards grant a player one-time effects. One of these cards – “Ice Age”
– will trigger the end of the game.
The “Survival” Card is not a Dominance Card and has its own separate
set of rules (see page 20).

Reptile
Bird
Amphibian
Arachnid
Insect

Initiative Markers—The set of six
square markers used on the Initiative
track to determine the order of placement during each Planning Phase.

Metamorphosis
Swap an element disk on
your animal with one of
your choice from the
draw bag.

Dominant / Dominance—Having at least one
species present on a tile where your animal
matches more elements than that of any other
animal with species present on that same tile.
Earth—The group of tiles placed in the hex grid portion
of the board. Players will place elements and their animals’
species and dominance markers onto the various tiles making up the earth.
Element—Grass,
grub, meat, seed,
sun and water.
These
round
markers – or “disks” – represent the resources the various
animals require to thrive. Elements are placed on the animal displays to show “need” and on earth to show “supply”.
When on earth, elements are placed on the corners of tiles—
in this manner, a single element disk can be present on up
to three different tiles simultaneously.

Rulebook

Mammal
Reptile
Bird
Amphibian
Arachnid
Insect

Mammal

Matching—The number of element “A” on a player’s animal
display times the number of that same element “A” on a tile
occupied by that player’s species. To this is added matching
element “B”, matching element “C”, etc. to arrive at a total
number of matching elements of all types.
See the graphic example on page 7.
Species—Each small wooden cube on earth represents one species. Each like-colored set of cubes
represent the various species belonging to a single animal.
Terrain—Tundra, mountain, desert, forest, jungle, savannah, wetland or sea. Each tile making up the earth is one of
these eight terrain types.
Tile—The large and small hexagonal pieces representing the
various terrain types. These are
used to initially create – then
during the game to add to –
the earth’s playing surface.
Victory Point (VP)—Collected during the game by each
animal. Highest VP total determines final winner.

The elements

Game Setup

Take two of each of the six element types and place them
on the tiles of earth as indicated on the board.

The Board

Place the board – face up! – in the center of the table.

Gather up the rest of the elements and form a draw pool
by placing them into the cloth bag provided.

The Animals

Have each player choose the animal he would like to
play. Give each player the animal display matching their
choice. Alternately, you can assign one animal display
to each player at random.
See page 17 for a suggested alternate method of
assigning animals if there are only 2 or 3 players.
In reverse Initiative order – that is, insects first, then
arachnids, then amphibians, etc. – players place their
animal’s square initiative marker into the boxes underneath the “Initiative” tag.
If there are fewer than six players, one or more of the
right-most boxes in this section will remain vacant
throughout the game.
Place any unassigned animal displays – along with their
initiative markers – back in the game box: they will not
be used.

The Tiles

Place one large tile belonging to each of the seven
non-tundra terrain types into their assigned positions
in the center of the hex grid. Place a tundra tile atop
the sea tile.

Place the eleven remaining tundra tiles in a face up
stack on the “Glaciation Tiles” section of the board.
Flip the remaining 24 large tiles face down and shuffle them up in any manner desired. Create three (face
down) stacks of 8 large tiles each. Place these stacks
on the three “Wanderlust Tiles” sections of the board.
Turn the top-most tile of each of these stacks face up.

The Cards

Set the Survival Card off to the side for now.
Remove the Ice Age card from the deck of Dominance
Cards. Shuffle the remaining 25 Dominance Cards together. Place the Ice Age card face down next to the
board. Put the shuffled Dominance Cards face down
atop this card to form a draw pile.
Draw the top five cards of this draw pile and place them
face up in the “Available Dominance Cards” section of
the game board.

Page 4

Place these element disks so that they slightly overlap each
of the tiles that meet at that intersection.

Randomly draw 4 elements from the bag—place them
on the board into the four squares allotted for them (the
ones with the “leaf” symbol) next to the “Adaptation” tag.
Draw 4 more elements at random to fill the leaf squares
next to the “Abundance” tag, and another 4 random elements for the leaf squares next to the “Wanderlust” tag.

The species

From amongst the wooden pieces, each player chooses
a color to represent his animal. From their colored pieces, each player gathers up the ten cones (to be used as
dominance markers) as well as the following number of
cylinders (to be used as action pawns) and cubes (to
form their species gene pool):

●●
●●
●●
●●
●●

6-player game – 3 cylinders and 35 cubes
5-player game – 4 cylinders and 40 cubes
4-player game – 5 cylinders and 45 cubes
3-player game – 6 cylinders and 50 cubes
2-player game – 7 cylinders and 55 cubes

Put the rest of the cylinders and cubes back in the box.
From each player’s gathered cubes, take one to use as
a VP marker: place these on the “0” space of the Victory
Point Track.
Each player then takes species from his gene pool and
places them on certain starting tile as follows:
●●
●●
●●
●●
●●
●●

Insects – 2 on savannah, 1 on wetland and desert
Arachnids – 2 on jungle, 1 on forest and wetland
Amphibians – 2 on wetland, 1 on jungle and savannah
Birds – 2 on forest, 1 on mountain and jungle
Reptiles – 2 on desert, 1 on savannah and mountain
Mammals – 2 on mountain, 1 on desert and forest

With fewer than six players, ignore placement instructions
for any animal not being played. Note that each animal
begins the game Dominating its centrally-occupied tile.

Begin play

The game now begins with the Planning Phase of the first
turn, with the player in control of the animal having its
initiative marker furthest to the left on the Initiative track
conducting the first AP placement.

Dominant Species

Earth

Elements
These are the round markers that
make up the six elements used in
Dominant Species: grass, grub,
meat, seed, sun and water.
When placed on a tile of earth,
an element represents “supply”;
when on an animal display, an
element represents “need”. Taken together, these provide for an
animal’s “matching” elements on
each tile of earth.

The large and small hexagonal tiles will, when added to the
game board’s hexagonal play area, make up the “earth”—
the playing surface that much of the game will be focused
on.
The species belonging to each animal will be placed on
earth tiles from their respective gene pools. Species removed from earth for any reason other than Glaciation (see
page 13) are placed back in the box, out of play—NOT back
into the gene pools.

Draw Bag

When not on an animal display, on the action display, or on
a tile of earth, elements are kept in the draw bag. Whenever
a new element is called for, it is always taken from this draw
bag. Conversely, whenever an element is removed from an
animal display or the game board it is always placed back in
this draw bag for later use.

Elements will occupy the corners of the earth tiles when
not on an animal display, on the action display, or awaiting
deployment from the element draw bag.
The cone-shaped dominance markers will be placed on tiles
of earth when the corresponding animal can claim dominance there.
New (large) sea, wetland, savannah, jungle, forest, desert
and mountain tiles will be added to the edges of earth
when players perform the Wanderlust action. These are
taken from the top of the three tile draw stacks.
New (small) tundra tiles are taken from the tundra draw
stack and placed onto existing (large) tiles when players
perform the Glaciation action. This converts that large tile
into a tundra tile for the remainder of the game.
Tiles that touch along a common edge are said to be “adjacent” to one another.
Even though a tundra tile is slightly smaller than the tile it sits
upon – and therefore will not physically touch the six tiles that
could conceivably surround it – it is still considered adjacent
to those tiles as it converts the tile underneath it into tundra:
which does physically touch the tiles next to it.

MATCHING ELEMENTS EXAMPLE: In the graphic at right,
the insects dominate the desert tile even though they have
fewer units there than the amphibians; dominance being
based on quality, not quantity.
The insects match a total of 3 elements (1 grass + 1 grass +
1 grub + 0 water) to the amphibians’ 2 elements (1 grub + 1
grub + 0 meat + 0 water three times over).
Even having just its two default sun elements, if one of the
reptile species in the savannah migrated into the desert the
reptiles could immediately claim dominance from the insects
with a total of 6 matching elements (2 sun x 3 matches each).
Note that with three water the amphibians would dominate
the savannah (3 to 2) if they were to move there.
Note also that if the sun element sitting on both these tiles
were to be removed the reptiles would be endangered in the
savannah, as they would no longer match any elements there.

Dominant Species

Matching elements

Some effects call for a player to determine his animal’s
“matching” elements on a tile. To determine an animal’s
matching elements on a particular tile, do the following:
●●

count the number of times the animal’s left-most element
type appears on the tile;

●●

to this count add the number of times the animal’s second element appears on the tile;

●●

repeat for each of that animal’s third, fourth, fifth and
sixth element, if present, to arrive at a sum total.

See the graphic example below.

Endangered Species

Any species occupying a tile where its animal matches exactly zero elements is said to be “endangered”.
Endangered species are vulnerable to elimination during
the Extinction action and cannot claim dominance of a tile.

Dominance

When an animal has at least one of its species present on
a tile and that animal matches more elements there than
any other single animal with a species present, it is said to
have “dominance” on that tile. A tie for greatest matching
elements means no animal is dominant there.
Endangered species can never claim dominance, even if
their animal has the only species present on the tile.
Dominance of a tile is signified by the placement of a wooden cone of that player’s chosen color. Dominance can be
gained or lost at any time and is effective immediately. Further, it is the responsibility of the players – not the rules in
and of themselves – to call for a change of dominance.
In other words, dominance (or the loss of it) must be verbally
and physically claimed and is not automatic. Thus once
dominance of a tile is legally established, that dominance will
remain in effect unless and until another player: (a) claims
dominance there for his own animal, or (b) shows there
to be a tie for greatest number of matching elements, thus
removing the previous animal’s dominance marker.
Players will usually want to check to see if any animals have
gained or lost dominance at the conclusion of those actions
affecting placement or removal of elements—the Adaptation
or Depletion actions, for example.
Each animal has 10 dominance cones. This is not a hard limit:
in the unlikely event that a single animal dominates 11 or
more tiles, use any method desired to mark the excess.

Species

Action Display

The wooden cubes represent the “species” that each animal will use to represent itself on earth. Most species will
begin the game in their owner’s gene pool. Most or all of
them will eventually occupy (be placed on) the tiles of earth.
Species removed from earth for any reason other than Glaciation are permanently removed from the game.

This is the large pink-gray boxed area on the right side of
the game board. The action display is the game’s “engine”,
so to speak, and will facilitate each player’s wants and desires as far as furthering their animal’s destiny on earth.
The action display:

A player is never “out of the game”, even if he somehow
both runs out of species in his gene pool and loses his last
remaining species on earth. An animal caught in such a
dilemma won’t be able to speciate or migrate, for example,
but still has other action options (and still maintains a VP total).

Gene pool

Prior to being placed on a tile of earth, species belonging to
an animal are kept in a pile in front of their owning player—
each such pile is called a “gene pool”. Whenever a species
is added to earth, it is always taken from that player’s gene
pool. However, whenever a species is removed from earth
for any reason other than Glaciation it is always placed
back into the box, out of play (not back into the player’s
gene pool).

Victory Point
Track
The “Victory Point Track” runs around the outside of the
board. This is where, using one of its allotted cubes, each
animal will keep track of its current VP score throughout
the game.
Whenever an animal gains or loses VPs, move its cube forward or backward on the track accordingly. Place a spare
like-colored cube in the “+100” space if an animal ever goes
above 100 VPs. VPs may never drop below zero.
The spare cube may come from those previously removed
from the game.

Dominant Species

Sequence of play

Execution Phase

Dominant Species is played in a series of turns in which all
players take part more or less simultaneously. Each turn is
divided into three Phases:

During the Execution Phase, APs placed on the action display during the immediately preceding Planning Phase are
removed – one at a time in top-down and left-right order
– and the appropriate action performed by the owning
player. The order is thus:

Planning Phase
Execution Phase

1.	 Initiative
2.	 Adaptation
3.	 Regression
4.	 Abundance
5.	 Wasteland
6.	 Depletion
7.	 Glaciation
8.	 Speciation
9.	 Wanderlust
10.	Migration
11.	Competition
12.	Domination

Reset Phase
During the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing
their available action pawns (APs) into the “eyeball” spaces
of the action display that dominates the right half of the
board. Each AP will indicate an action to be taken by that
player during the following Execution Phase. Each action
space can hold a maximum of one AP so it’s “first come, first
served”.
During the Execution Phase – which begins once all available APs have been placed for the turn – APs are removed
from the action display in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
Each time an AP is removed in this fashion, the owning
player performs the action indicated in that section’s title
bar (such as “Glaciation” or “Migration”).
During the Reset Phase (page 20), some species may go
extinct and one player may be able to score VPs via the
Survival Card. Then if the game hasn’t ended yet the action
display is reset for the following turn.
Play continues from turn to turn in this manner until the
game ends and final scoring occurs (page 20).

Planning Phase
During each turn’s Planning Phase players will, one at a
time in left-to-right Initiative order, place one of their available APs into any vacant “eyeball” action space of the action
display. Each eyeball space can contain at most a single AP.
APs cannot be placed into non-eyeball spaces, such as the
one with the arachnid icon in the Competition section.
After the last animal in Initiative order has placed an AP, the
current “round” ends and a new round begins with the animal at the front of the Initiative track. Rounds continue in
left-to-right Initiative order until all animals have run out of
available APs to place. In each round, any animal that has
run out of available APs is simply skipped when its position
on the track is reached. Unplayed animals are also skipped.

Rulebook

Voluntary Actions

Actions are never mandatory: when a player’s AP is removed from the action display he may choose to voluntarily
forfeit the allowed action in its entirety.

Skipping sections

Most sections of the action display can be skipped if they
contain no APs. Exceptions include:
●●

Regression—this section always affects all animals with
matching added elements;

●●

Wasteland—this section always affects all tundra tiles
with matching elements;

●●

Speciation—the insects always get a chance to add a single species to the board;

●●

Competition—the arachnids always get a chance to compete against a single opposing species.

The various actions are described on the following pages in
detail, and are presented in the same order in which they
are to be executed during actual play of the game.
The actions are also presented – in order of execution – in
abbreviated form on each player’s animal display.

Initiative

Adaptation

Initiative
at start,
initiative for
the animal
lowest on the
food chain
goes here

Adaptation
second
lowest goes
here; etc.

At the start of the Execution Phase, remove any AP that was
placed here. That player performs the following activities:
●●

●●

On the Initiative track, swap his animal’s initiative marker
with that of the animal directly to the left of it—thus effectively moving one space forward on the Initiative track.
Ignore this activity if the acting animal already occupies
the front (left-most) Initiative spot.
Place the AP that was just removed into any vacant eyeball space.

After any Initiative action has been performed, APs are removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order.
When an animal’s AP is removed, that player selects one of
the elements currently present in this section. The chosen
element is removed from the action display and placed on
an empty (gray) element space on that animal’s display.
No animal may ever have more than six elements on its
animal display (counting both the inherent elements and
added elements). If the acting animal already possesses six
elements, this action is forfeited.
Animals are allowed to acquire multiples of the same element type.

The player effectively makes the very last AP placement of
this turn, as well as moving forward in turn order for the
following turn’s Planning Phase.

EXAMPLE: In the Planning Phase the reptile player (black)
decides to improve his position a bit on the Initiative track,
so he places an AP here in the first turn of a six player game.
When his AP is removed, he first swaps positions with the
bird player’s initiative marker (A). He then chooses another
empty eyeball space to place the AP that was just removed:
seeing an opportunity to get more sun into play, he takes the
last vacant space in the Abundance section (B).

Page 10

EXAMPLE: The insect player (green) wants to diversify a
bit. He gets to remove his AP first and chooses to place the
available meat element on his animal display (A). The white
and red players are left with grub and grass to choose from.
The insects could have instead chosen to specialize by taking
the grass element (B) to add to their two default grass. Taking
one of the two available grubs (C) is risky because, if neither
of the other two players took the other grub, it would move
down to the Regression Box at the end of the turn (D) thereby
forcing the insects to spend a precious AP next turn to save it.

Dominant Species

REGRESSION
Regression

Abundance
Abundance

Regression Box

After all Adaptation actions have been performed, Regression occurs as follows: for each element type present in the
Regression Box, every animal removes one element disk of
the same type from its animal display.
Action Pawn Benefit—Each AP present in this section
prevents one such element from being removed from that
animal. Note the third space here with the reptile
symbol inside: the reptiles are always considered
to have one “free” AP in this section.

After the Regression action has occurred, APs are removed
from this section one at a time in left-to-right order. When
an animal’s AP is removed, that player selects one of the
elements currently present in this section. The chosen element is removed from the action display and placed on a
vacant corner of any tile of earth.
Elements can be placed on any vacant corner of a tile, even
a corner shared by only one or zero other tiles (that is, those
tile corners currently on the “edge” of earth).

During the Planning Phase the reptile player can still choose
to place APs in this section as normal if he so desires.
No animal may ever have its default elements removed
(those printed in the upper left corner of the animal displays). Animals possessing only their default elements
cannot be affected by Regression in any way.
After any and all Regression occurs, return any APs in this
section to their owners.

EXAMPLE: The amphibians get first pick (A) and choose to
place one of the available water elements as indicated. This
gives them dominance of the Savannah tile: 6 matching
elements to the insect’s 4 (B).
The reptiles get second pick (C) and choose to place the
available sun tile as shown. This will allow them to later
expand into the mountain tile without those species going
extinct.

EXAMPLE: The Regression Box holds two grub elements
(though this counts as only one element type) (A). The insect
player placed an AP here, which saves his grub element from
being removed (B). The reptile player’s free AP here likewise
saves his grub (C).
Note that the insect player’s sun element is in danger of
being removed next turn when the sun sitting in Adaptation
is moved down into Regression at the end of the this turn (D).

Wasteland

Depletion
Depletion

Wasteland Box

After all Abundance actions have been performed, remove
any AP that was placed here. That player removes any one
element currently in the Wasteland Box, placing it back in
the draw bag.
Then, regardless of whether there was an AP placed in this
section or not, the Wasteland action automatically occurs:
remove all elements from tundra tiles that match the element type(s) still present in the Wasteland Box. Removed
elements are placed back in the draw bag.

Depletion Box

After any Wasteland action has been performed, remove
any AP that was placed here. That player selects one element on earth that matches an element type in the
Depletion Box. The chosen element disk is removed from
earth and placed back in the draw bag.
If none of the elements in the Depletion Box match elements
on earth, this action can have no effect.
Note that the Depletion Box will be empty – and thus the
action useless – during the first and second game turns.

Note that the Wasteland Box will be empty – and the action
skipped – during the first turn of the game.

EXAMPLE: The arachnids remove their AP, choosing to place
the grub element in the Wasteland Box back in the draw
bag. Thus the two grubs adjacent to tundra are saved (A).
A water element remains in the Wasteland Box, so all water
elements on earth that are currently adjacent to a tundra are
removed and place back in the draw bag (B).
The amphibians lose their dominance of the desert tile
because their species there are now endangered (C).

Page 12

EXAMPLE: The mammal player removes his AP from this
section. There is a lone seed element in the Depletion Box
so he may remove any one seed element from earth. He
chooses the one straddling the desert and savannah (A).
On each tile the birds go from matching 4 elements to
matching 2. They lose dominance of the desert as they
are now tied with the reptiles (B). The mammals will gain
dominance of the savannah where before it was a tie (C).

This means that an element occupying a corner of only one
or two tundra tiles on the “edge” of earth are unaffected.

After any Depletion action has been performed, remove
the left-most AP (only) from this section. That player conducts a Glaciation action by performing the following steps:
1.	 Select a non-tundra tile that is adjacent to at least one
other tundra tile.
2.	 Remove and temporarily set aside all species from the
chosen tile.
3.	 Place a new tundra tile (from the face up stack) on top of
the chosen tile.
The tile is no longer considered to be its former terrain type
and is instead treated as a “tundra tile” for the rest of the game.
4.	 Remove all elements from earth that are surrounded by
exactly three tundra tiles.

EXAMPLE: The reptile player gets the Glaciation action this
turn. He would like to glaciate the Savannah because, not
only would it would give him 3 bonus VPs for placement
next to two existing tundra tiles, but would also give
him control of the Survival Card (3 total reptiles in tundra
compared to 2 arachnids and 1 insect). However,
he doesn’t want the lone sun
element to become
surrounded by three
tundra and thus
be removed
during
step 4....

Rulebook

5.	 Gain bonus VPs (see page 3) based on the number
of existing tundra tiles that are adjacent to the newlyplaced tile.
6.	 From the pile of set-aside species, place 1 belonging to
each animal back onto the tile.
7.	 The remainder of the removed species, if any, are displaced back to their owners’ gene pools (instead of
being eliminated and put back in the box).
If there are no tundra tiles remaining in the stack (all 12 are
already out on earth) this action is forfeit.
Note that if there are any APs in the second, third or fourth
eyeball spaces these are not removed at this time. Instead,
these will shift forward during the upcoming Reset Phase.
Players will find that Glaciation is subtly powerful enough
to sometimes warrant investing in a future action, even if it
means being without the use of an AP for a turn or two.
So he instead chooses the desert tile for Glaciation (step 1).
He removes all the species there (step 2) then places a new
tundra tile atop it (step 3). Step 4 has no effect. In step 5
he scores 1 bonus VP (for there being one existing tundra
adjacent to the new tile). Then, of the species removed in
step 2 – 1 insect, 2 birds and 4 amphibians – one of
each is put back on the new tundra
(step 6), with the remaining 1
bird and 3 amphibians
being put back into
their respective
gene pools
(step 7).

After any Glaciation action has been performed, APs are
removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order. When an animal’s AP is removed, that player chooses
any one element on earth that matches the element type
accompanying the space from which the AP was taken. He
then places new species from his gene pool onto the adjacent tiles as follows:
●●
●●
●●
●●

Wanderlust

Up to 4 species if the tile is sea or wetland.
Up to 3 species if the tile is savannah, jungle or forest.
Up to 2 species if the tile is desert or mountain.
Up to 1 species if the tile is tundra.

Note that only one, two or three tiles can be populated at a
time: those with a corner occupied by the chosen element.
After all Speciation actions have been performed,
the insect player may place a single species from
his gene pool onto any one tile of earth.

After all Speciation actions have been performed, APs are
removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order.
When an animal’s AP is removed, that player selects one of
the available face up large tiles (those atop the Wanderlust
Tiles stacks). He then performs the following activities in
the order shown:
1.	 Select a vacant (white) hex on the game board and place
the new tile there. The hex selected must be adjacent to
at least one existing tile of earth.
2.	 May select one of the available element disks in the Wanderlust section of the action display and place it onto
any vacant corner of the newly-placed tile.
3.	 Gain bonus VPs (see page 3) based on the number of
existing tiles adjacent to the newly-placed tile.
Finally, in food chain order, every player may move all,
some or none of his species that are currently adjacent to
the newly-placed tile onto that tile.

During the Planning Phase the insect player can still choose
to place APs in other spaces within this section if he so desires.

If any of the three tile stacks becomes depleted, the number
of possible Wanderlust actions will be reduced accordingly.

EXAMPLE: The arachnids remove an AP from the “grass”
eyeball space. They choose the grass element shown below
(A). This allows them to place 3 more species in the savannah
(B), 2 in the desert (C), and 1 more into the tundra (D).
The amphibians lose dominance of the desert since they are
tied with the arachnids at 3 matching elements each (E).
The insects then place their free species in the savannah in
order to maintain the quantitative advantage there (F).

EXAMPLE: The birds are first. They choose a face up wetland
tile to place (A) along with an available seed element (B).
There exist 2 tiles adjacent to the new wetland tile (C):
referencing the Bonus Points Table, this nets the birds 3 VPs.
The birds then decide to move 1 of their adjacent species onto
the new wetland tile, immediately claiming dominance (D).
The arachnids decline (they would be endangered there).
Finally, the insects move in 2 of their species (E).

After all Wanderlust actions have been performed, APs are
removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order. When an animal’s AP is removed, that player selects up
to X of his animal’s species anywhere on earth, where X is
the number in the space from which the AP was taken.
Each chosen species is then moved onto an adjacent tile.
Each bird species may Migrate to a tile up to two
tiles away: that is, birds may be moved through an
adjacent tile and onto a second tile.
Birds cannot migrate over blank hexes (those not yet
containing a terrain tile).
Migrating species beginning a Migration action on the
same tile may move together onto the same tile or be split
up onto separate tiles, at the owning player’s discretion.
EXAMPLE: The insects remove an AP from the “7” eyeball
space. They move 1 insect from the desert to the adjacent
savannah, claiming dominance (A). Being endangered on
the tundra, they use their last 6 migrates to move their species
out of there: 4 to the desert (B) and 2 to the mountain (C).
The birds also have a Migration AP this turn. Seeing what the
insects did, they plan to use their special ability to move one
of their species from the sea to the now vacant tundra (D).

After all Migration actions have been performed, APs are removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order.
When an animal’s AP is removed, that player notes the three
terrain types associated with the space from which the AP
was taken. He then chooses up to 1 tile of each of those terrain types currently on earth. To choose a tile, it must contain:
●●
●●

at least one of that animal’s species; and
at least one opposing species.

That player then eliminates any 1 opposing species on each
of the chosen tiles. Place eliminated species back in the box,
out of play (not back in their owners’ gene pools).
The arachnids are always considered to have one
“free” AP in this section. They compete first, in any
terrain type, but only on a single tile.
In the Planning Phase the arachnid player can still choose to
place APs in other spaces within this section if he so desires.

EXAMPLE: The reptiles have an AP in the “tundra-desert-forest”
eyeball space (A). They choose to eliminate 1 mammal in the
left-most forest (B) and 1 insect in the tundra (C). They have
no presence in the desert so forfeit their third competition (D).
Even with presence, they cannot compete in the second
forest nor in the sea this turn (E).

Domination
Domination
After all Competition actions have been performed, APs are
removed from this section one at a time in left-to-right order. When an animal’s AP is removed, that player selects
one tile on earth that has not yet been chosen for Domination this turn. That tile is then scored by performing the
following steps:
1.	 The animal having the most species present on the tile gains X VPs,
where X equals the first number listed for that terrain type on the Tile
Scoring table on the game board.

Note that when the Ice Age card is selected, the game will
end at the conclusion of the current turn (see page 20).
Note also that the dominant animal might not be the same as
the animal that chose to score that particular tile, and might
not be the animal that scored the most points.
Finally, be aware that the first player each turn to have a
chance to select a Dominance Card will have five effects
to choose from—after which the choices will become
progressively fewer as face up Dominance Cards are selected
and their effects resolved.
After all Domination actions have been performed, the Execution Phase is over and play proceeds to the Reset Phase
(see page 20).

2.	 If the tile being scored is any terrain
other than tundra, the animal with
the second highest number of species present gains a number of VPs
equal to the second number listed
for that terrain on the Tile Scoring
table.
There must be another animal present—
an animal alone on a tile cannot claim
both first and second place.
3.	 If the tile being scored is sea, wetland, savannah, jungle
or forest, the animal with the third highest number of
species present gains a number of VPs equal to the third
number listed for that terrain on the Tile Scoring table.
There must be a third animal present—an animal claiming first
or second place on a tile cannot also claim third place.

EXAMPLE: The reptile player has chosen to score the lone
wetland tile in play. First place (8 VPs) goes to the amphibians
with 4 species present. Reptiles and birds have 2 species each:
the reptiles are higher on the food chain and so score 4 VPs
for second place. The birds settle for third place (2 VPs) while
no animal gets the last 1 VP for fourth place.
Then, being dominant on the tile, the reptiles must choose
and execute one face up Dominance Card.

4.	 If the tile being scored is sea or wetland, the animal with
the fourth highest number of species present gains 2 or
1 VPs, respectively.
There must be a fourth animal present—an animal claiming first,
second or third place on a tile cannot also claim fourth place.
●●

IMPORTANT: In all cases above, ties for number of species
on the tile being scored are broken in descending food
chain order (that is, mammals first, then reptiles, etc.).

5.	 Finally, if there is a dominant animal on the tile being
scored that player must select and execute one face up
Dominance Card (if one is available). Any choices to be
made in the execution of a Dominance Card are made
by the player who chose it. After execution place the
card back in the box, permanently out of play.
Clarifications of card effects can be found on pages 18-19.

Dominant Species

Optional 2- and
3-player Rules

Optional (random)
Earth Setup

When playing Dominant Species with only 2 or 3 players,
the following rules may be used which allow for each
player to control multiple animals. These rules conflict with
some of those found elsewhere in this rulebook: where
there is conflict, the rules in this column take precedence.

The following alternate setup for earth will have the
animals beginning the game unevenly matched but with
varying starting VP levels to compensate. This option can
be used with either the base game or in conjunction with
the optional 2- and 3-player rules to the left.

Follow normal setup for earth except as follows:

Multiple animals

When assigning animals to the players during set up, assign all six animals. Thus in a 3-player game each player
will be in control of two different animals; in a 2-player
game, each player will control three different animals.
Players should assign one colored set of wooden bits to
each of their animals. Each animal receives 3 cylinders
and 35 cubes as if it were a 6-player game. Each animal
maintains its own separate VP total.

Actions

When one of a player’s animals is acting, his other
animal(s) and their species are considered “opposing” for
all purposes (exactly as if they were controlled by an opposing player). For example, when a Dominance Card
refers to “your animal” it is referring only to the animal
that was dominant on the scored tile—in this case your
other controlled animal(s) would be treated as opposing.

Final scoring

While all six animals will ostensibly gain VPs throughout
the game, only one belonging to each player will count
for the final score. At the end of the game, each player’s animal with the lowest individual score will be that
player’s overall final score—animals with higher scores
belonging to the same player are ignored.
Thus it behooves you to try to maintain a balance between
your multiple animals throughout the game rather than
sacrificing one for the benefit of another.
For example, in a 2-player game Mark’s animals have
scores of 70, 145 and 160—netting him only 70 VPs. If Bob’s
animals had 75, 85 and 95 points, his final score would be
75 for the win.

Rulebook

Tiles
Prior to placing tiles on the board, shuffle all the large tiles
face down. Draw seven at random and place them into
the seven starting spaces. (The remainder form the three
draw piles as normal.) Place a tundra atop the central tile.

Elements

One at a time, randomly draw a total of twelve elements
from the bag, placing them onto the twelve tile corners
normally allotted for starting elements. (The action display is seeded with elements normally.)

Species

Place 1 mammal species onto each non-tundra tile containing a single meat element; 2 mammals onto each
non-tundra tile containing 2 meat; 3 mammals onto each
non-tundra tile containing 3 meat; etc.
Repeat this process for reptiles and sun; birds and seed;
amphibians and water; arachnids and grub; insects and
grass.
Identify the animal having the most species on earth and
count those species. Place every animal’s VP cube into
the space of the Victory Point Track equal to this count.
Then each animal loses a number of starting VPs equal to
the number of starting species it has on earth (thus the
animal or animals with the greatest number of starting
species will begin the game with 0 VPs).
It is possible, however unlikely, that an animal will begin the
game with no species on earth. If this occurs, don’t panic!
That animal will start the game with a nice VP lead—plus it
means that the odds of its preferred element coming out
of the draw bag and onto the action display is enhanced.

The cards

Biomass

If your animal is alone on such an overcrowded tile you
must eliminate one of your own species there. If multiple
animals have species on an overcrowded tile, you choose
which one dies out.

beginning of the game. During
play, players should keep track of

of the Survival Card. If two or more
players are tied for most, no player
controls the card (it remains uncontrolled and will not score
points for any player).
During each Reset Phase, after Extinction, the player in control of the Survival Card earns bonus VPs (see page 3) for
the number of tundra tiles occupied by one or more of his
animal’s species.

Blight

The dominant player chooses which elements to remove
from the chosen tile.

Catastrophe

The dominant player chooses which species to eliminate on
the chosen tile. It is also that player’s choice as to which single species to remove from adjacent tiles. The second part
is mandatory, however, so if the dominant player is the sole
occupant of an adjacent tile he will have to eliminate one of
his own animal’s species there.

Cold Snap

Every animal except the one controlled by the player selecting this card loses one of its species on each tundra tile.

Dominance Cards

The 26 Dominance Cards are a
player’s reward for being dominant on a tile that is scored during

must resolve all of the card’s effect
(or at least as much as possible given the current game situation). The
card is then placed back in the box, out of play.

Should a question arise during play, hints and clarifications for
the various card effects are outlined below.

Aquatic

Take the chosen element from the draw bag. If there are no
vacant corners on any sea or wetland tiles currently in play
the first part of this card is forfeit. If you have no species
remaining in your gene pool the second part of this card
is forfeit.

Biodiversity

You don’t receive additional VPs if a tile contains more than
one opposing species—it’s simply 1 VP per tile that you occupy that has ANY opposing species on it.

Page 18

Disease

An animal’s default (printed) elements can never be removed. If the order of removal makes a difference, they are
removed in food chain order. Place any removed elements
back into the draw bag.

Ecodiversity

Remember that “sun” is a single element “type”—so, for example, the two default sun elements on reptiles count once
for this card effect, not twice.

Evolution

You may select species anywhere on earth to replace—you
don’t need to share a tile with a chosen animal, for example. If you only have zero or one species remaining in your
pool you can only replace zero or one opposing species,
respectively.

Fecundity

You get only +1 per occupied tile; not +1 per species on that
tile. If the number of species remaining in your gene pool is
less than the number of tiles you occupy, you choose which
tiles get the additional species and which are skipped.

Fertile

It’s 1 VP for every species on the chosen tile—yours or an
opposing animal’s.

Dominant Species

Habitat

The element is not drawn at random—the player may
choose any element currently in the draw bag.

Hibernation

The species may only come from those previously eliminated (not from a player’s species gene pool and not from
among those put back in the box at the start of the game).

Nocturnal

This card has no effect if chosen by the animal already at
the front of the line.

Omnivore

The new action pawn comes from those set aside at the
start of the game.

Parasitism

Ice age

The game will end at the conclusion of the turn in which this
card is selected—after Domination, perform Extinction and
score the Survival Card as normal but skip the Reseed step.
Then perform final scoring (see Endgame on page 20).

Ice Sheet

This ability follows all the normal rules for Glaciation (see
page 13).

Immigrants

Animals make their decisions in food chain order. An animal
having only its default (printed) elements cannot choose
the first option—nice try!

If the animal lowest in the food chain picks this card, they
will be the only animal to benefit. Retrieve new action
pawns from those set aside at the start of the game.

Predator

Note the word “opposing” on this card: you don’t have to
eliminate one of your own species on tiles containing only
your species. You may choose a different opposing animal’s
species on each tile.

Symbiotic

This effect counts default as well as added elements.

Instinct

The AP may be placed into any empty eyeball space—even
one that has yet to be acted upon this turn. This card generally acts as a super-early placement for the following turn.

Intelligence

If the animal highest in the food chain picks this card, they
will be the only animal to benefit. Retrieve new action
pawns from those set aside at the start of the game.

Mass Exodus

The player choosing this card moves all animals, even his
opponents’. Species may be split up amongst any and all
adjacent tiles as the player sees fit.

Metamorphosis

You cannot dump your two default (printed) elements.
Note that you choose an element from the draw bag—the
new element is not selected at random.

Niche Biomes

Remember that this card isn’t chosen until after the relevant
tile is fully scored. The “first place” value of a tile is its leftmost number on the Tile Scoring table: for example, 9 for
sea, 8 for wetland, 7 for savannah, etc.

During the Reset Phase, animals may lose species to extinction and one animal may be able to gain VPs via the
Survival Card. Then the action display is reset in preparation for the next turn’s Planning Phase.

board. Any cards already occupying this section remain
where they are. If there are not enough cards remaining in the draw pile to fill up every card slot, fill up as
many as you can; the rest will remain vacant.
Once the draw pile is depleted, no new cards will be
placed for the remainder of the game.

Extinction

First, Extinction occurs as follows: Eliminate all endangered species. Eliminated species are removed from earth
and placed back into the box, out of play.
EXCEPTION: Each turn the mammal player may
automatically save one of his endangered species from Extinction (his choice of which if he
has more than one that is endangered).

Survival

Next, make sure the player having the most species on
tundra tiles is in possession of the Survival Card. If there
is a tie for most species, no player receives the card. The
owning player, if any, then scores bonus VPs (see page 3)
based on the total number of tundra tiles occupied by his
species (the quantity of species on each tile is irrelevant).

Reseed
Note: You do not need to perform this step if this is the last
turn of the game (via play of the Ice Age card).

●●

Slide any APs in the second, third and fourth spaces of
the Glaciation section one space to the left.

●●

Remove all elements from the Regression, Depletion
and Wanderlust sections of the action display. Place
them back into the draw bag.

●●

Slide all elements in the Wasteland Box down into the
Depletion Box.

●●

Slide all elements in the Abundance section down into
the Wasteland Box.

●●

Slide all elements in the Adaptation section down into
the Regression Box.

●●

Draw 4 elements at random from the bag and place
them into the four “leaf” squares of the Adaptation
section.

●●

Draw another 4 elements at random and place them
into the four “leaf” squares of the Abundance section.

●●

Draw another 4 elements at random and place them
into the four “leaf” squares of the Wanderlust section.

●●

If face down, flip face up the top tile of each of the
three large tile stacks. Any empty stack remains empty.

Finally, in preparation for the next turn perform the following activities:
●●

Draw enough new Domination Cards off the top of
the draw pile to fill – face up – each empty space of
the Available Dominance Cards section of the game

Play then proceeds to the next turn’s Planning Phase.

Endgame
When the game ends via the Ice Age card, finish the remainder of the Domination actions, if any, then perform Extinction and score the Survival Card as normal. Then remove all Domination markers from earth and score each and every
tile of earth one last time: Domination is ignored during final scoring—that is, animals gain VPs only, not any Dominance Cards that may be remaining.
Once final scoring is complete, the player in control of the animal with the highest VP total wins the game. In case of a
tie for highest, the tied animal closest to the top of the food chain wins the game for its controller.
