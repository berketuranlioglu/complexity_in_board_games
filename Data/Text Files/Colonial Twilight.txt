1.0 Introduction

Colonial Twilight: Algeria 1954-62 is a 2-player board game depicting the conflict in Algeria in its last eight years as a department
of France before it became an independent nation. Each player
takes the role of an agency seeking to set the fate of Algeria: the
French government and the insurgent anti-government forces
(mainly these consist of the armed elements of the Front de Liberation Nationale, (FLN) but also including other movements).
Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting
various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence or
control the population or otherwise achieve their aims. A deck of
cards regulates events, victory checks, and other processes. The
rules can run a FLN non-player faction, enabling a solitaire game
(or one player can take both factions).
This game is Volume 7 in the COIN Series of games that use similar rules to cover modern insurgencies. The Designer’s Notes in
the Playbook lists major rules differences from earlier volumes.

1.1 General Course of Play

Unlike many card-assisted war games, this game does not use
hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one at
time. Each Event card contains text that may alter or suspend
certain rules of the game, or demand execution of a particular task.
Propaganda cards mixed in with the Event cards provide periodic
opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as collecting
resources and influencing popular sympathies.

1.2 Components

A complete set of game components includes:
•	 A 22”x34” mounted game board (1.3).
•	 A deck of 71 cards (5.0).
•	 91 blue, black, and green wooden playing pieces, some
embossed (1.4; see “Forces Pool” on the Spaces List sheet for a
complete listing). Some extra blocks have been added to replace
any defective blocks.
•	 Six black, six white pawns (3.1.1).
•	 Four embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.3).

1.3 The Map

The map shows Algeria and nearby areas divided into various types
of spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include Sectors, Cities and Countries.
All spaces can hold forces.
1.3.2 Wilayas and Sectors. The map is divided into named and
numbered areas that correspond roughly with the Wilaya or zone
system used by the FLN command structure, with each Wilaya
(Roman numeral) divided into a number of mintaka or Sectors
(Arabic numerals, so V-1 is the first Sector in Wilaya 5). If you find
the numbering system cumbersome, each Sector is also marked with
the name of a major town located inside it.
Each Sector shows a Population Value (Pop) of 0, 1, or 2 that affects
victory via Support for or Opposition to the French government
(1.6) or Control (1.7) and some FLN actions. Sectors are further
distinguished as Mountain or Plain, affecting player operations and
certain Events (5.0).
During play, the Government player gains the ability to change the
Population Value of some spaces through Resettlement, turning
them from Population 1 to Population 0 (place a “Pop 0” marker to
denote this). (4.2.1)
1.3.3 Cities. Cities show Population Values of 2 or 3. Cities are
spaces in their own right, and are also considered to be part of the
Wilaya they are located in, for purposes of FLN March (3.3.2) or
Redeploy (6.4.2). Note that Oran and Algiers are Cities
contained entirely within a Sector, but Constantine is a
City that is adjacent to two Sectors. During play, Cities
may increase by up to 1 Population Value (place a “Pop
+1” marker to denote this).

DESIGN NOTE: Each Population Value point represents about
300,000 human beings.

1.3.8 Other Map Features. There are tracks and boxes on the map
that record various game parameters or store game pieces:

1.3.4 Countries: Morocco and Tunisia. These two Countries were
part of the French empire at the beginning of the Algerian conflict
but became independent. During the game, on play of a Pivotal
Event card (5.1.8), both of these Countries will become sanctuaries
for the FLN player’s pieces, and the Government player may begin
to fortify the borders of Algeria to prevent infiltration from them.
Only FLN pieces may be in these Countries, but FLN may not enter
these Countries until they become independent. These Countries are
treated as Mountain Sectors with a Population Value of 1: the FLN
may Rally, March and Extort in these Countries, but their Population
is never counted in the total Opposition (1.6.2). During play, these
Countries may acquire the ability to contain three Bases (1.4.2),
shown by “Base” markers placed in their spaces.

Edge Track. This track runs along the top of the game board, from
0 to 50. It records the amount of Resources the players have (1.8),
their current Victory Levels (1.9), the Government Commitment
Level (1.8) and the number of Resettled Sectors (4.2.1).

1.3.5 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any two spaces that share a land
border are considered adjacent.

France Track. Technically France is where the Government player’s Available Forces box is located, and
legally Algeria is a department of France, but for game
purposes this track is an abstract representation of the
ability of the FLN to obtain material from sympathetic organizations and expatriate Algerians, and to affect French
public opinion on the war (and therefore the government’s commitment to continuing the war).
Border Zone Track. When Morocco and Tunisia
gain their independence from France (5.1.8), this track
is activated to show a status of “0” (zero). During the
game the Government player may expend Resources
to improve the Border Zone Status so as to inhibit
infiltration from these two FLN safe havens (3.3.2).
Initiative Track. This diagram is divided into boxes to guide the
players’ choices during the Sequence of Play (2.3) and keep track
of player eligibility.
Available Forces boxes. Both players have one of these, to store
pieces that may be entered into the map spaces. Note that the Government player’s box is divided into two sections, one for French
pieces, and one for Algerian.
Out of Play box. This is a common box for pieces that are neither
Available nor able to be placed into the map spaces. Pieces enter
and leave this box through different game functions.
Casualties box. This is a common box for pieces that have been
eliminated during play. During Propaganda Rounds the pieces here
will move either to Out of Play or Available.

EXAMPLES: The sector of Philippeville (II-2) is adjacent to
Constantine, Setif (II-1), Barika (I-1), Oum el Bouaghi (1-4) and
Souk Ahras (II-3). Constantine is adjacent only to Setif (II-1) and
Philippeville (II-2).
1.3.6 Coasts. Any spaces adjacent to blue water are “coastal”.
Algiers and Oran are coastal spaces, as are Morocco and Tunisia.
Water is not land, so coastal spaces that do not share a land border
are not adjacent.
1.3.7 Border Sectors. There are seven Sectors that are partly bounded by an international border (three border on Morocco, and four border on Tunisia). In the Full Scenario, they are not considered Border
Sectors until Morocco and Tunisia have become independent and the
Border Zone activated, by play of a Pivotal Event Card (5.1.8). As
the international border is progressively fortified, the Border Zone
Status rises (3.2.1, 5.1.8). FLN Guerrillas will find it more difficult
to March into Border Sectors undetected (3.3.2) and will lose some
Resources in the Resources and Commitment Adjustment Phase of
Propaganda Rounds (6.2.2). Also, Police in Border Sectors count
as Troops in Assaults (3.2.4).

Capabilities box. This is a common box for players to store markers
that denote Capabilities of one side or the other (5.3).

1.5 Players & Factions

The game has two factions, the Government and the FLN. See 8.0
for rules to be used for an “automated” FLN player, if there is only
one human player and they do not want to play both factions.

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: French
Troops and Police (dark blue and light blue cubes, respectively),
Algerian Troops and Police (dark green and light green cubes), FLN
Guerrillas (black cylinders) and all Factions’ Bases (light blue or
black disks).
DESIGN NOTE: Police represent a combination of French Army
“sector troops” deployed for static defense, urban police, and
rural constabulary and militias. Bases represent command, training, and supply facilities as well as centres of civilian government
and administration.

1.4.1 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. A “Force Pool” inventory on the Spaces List sheet shows the number of pieces in the
game. Keep forces Available for placement in that player’s Available
Forces box. Place FLN Bases in the highest-numbered empty spaces
to show the number of on-map Bases to help track earnings (6.2)
and victory (7.0). Both players may have forces in the Out of Play
box—neither Available nor on the map—and forces can become
Casualties (3.3.3, 4.3.3, 5.0, 6.5). Otherwise, forces removed from
the map go to Available or Casualties.

1.5.1 Friends and Enemies. The government player has forces recruited or drafted from both metropolitan France (dark blue Troops,
and light blue Police and Bases) and Algeria (dark and light green
Troops and Police). They are on the same side, though Algerian
forces may be built as a result of Train Operations and are vulnerable
to Subvert Operations by the FLN player. Occasionally a game rule
or event will apply to French or Algerian Troops, or Police only, and
will be denoted as such: otherwise, the term “Government” applies
equally to both nationalities.
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. The rules do not bind players to agreements.

1.6 Support and Opposition

Support and Opposition affect victory and some operations and
activities.
1.6.1 Cities and Sectors with at least 1 Population (1.3.2-3) always
show one of three levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition
to the Government regime that can shift during play:

Unless otherwise instructed (by Event, 5.1.1), forces may only be
placed from or replaced with those in the Available boxes. A piece
to be replaced by a piece that is unavailable is simply removed.
Important: Players while executing an Operation, Special Activity,
or Event to place their own forces may take them from spaces elsewhere on the map if and only if the desired force type is not Available.

	
	
	

Exception to the above: the FLN cannot take pieces from Morocco
or Tunisia to do this (though the player can take pieces from other
spaces in Algeria to place them in these countries).

1.6.2 Support or Opposition affects player victory (7.2-.3). Show
Support or Opposition with markers placed in each City or Sector.
Show Neutral spaces by the absence of such markers.

EXAMPLES: During a Rally (3.3.1), an FLN player without Available Guerrillas could remove its own from a space (not in Morocco
or Tunisia) to place them Underground in a different space. Government Train could take Algerian cubes from another space if none
were in Available.

Total Support = total Pop Value of Cities and Sectors in Support

1.4.2 Stacking. No more than two Bases may occupy a single map space. Only FLN pieces may
occupy Morocco or Tunisia (1.3.4) (and there is an
Event Card that allows the FLN player to place up
to three Bases in each of these countries). Placing
(such as Bases via Train 3.2.1, Rally 3.3.1, Event 5.1.1, or Deploy,
4.2.1) or moving forces may never violate stacking.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas are either
Underground—symbol end down—or Active—
symbol end up. Actions and Events flip them from
one to the other state. Bases, Troops, and Police
are always Active. Always set up and place new Guerrillas Underground (including if replacing a piece).

Support	
(marker)	

	

	
Neutral	
Opposition
(no marker)	 (other side of marker)

Total Opposition = total Pop Value of Cities and Sectors in
Opposition in Algeria
NOTE: Pop 0 Sectors are always Neutral, never at Support or
Opposition.
1.6.3. Morocco and Tunisia are Pop 1, but this is only so as to allow
the FLN to Rally and Extort there. Their Population Values are never
included in Total Opposition.

1.7 Control

A player Controls a Sector or City if the
number of their pieces there exceeds that
of the other player. Control affects certain activities. Adjust Control markers
immediately as Control changes due to
placement, removal, or movement of pieces.

NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla, it is
sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active).
Also, “moving” or “relocating” Guerrillas does not affect Underground status unless specified.

1.8 Resources and Commitment

At any moment, a player will have between 0 and
50 Resources that are used to pay for Operations
(3.0). During Propaganda Rounds (6.0), players
will also gain or expend Resources for other
purposes. The Government player also has a Commitment Level,
also recorded on the Edge Track. This level is important during
Propaganda Rounds and is affected by Events, the
player’s operational choices, and the FLN player’s
actions. Mark Resources on the Edge Track with an
appropriate cylinder, and Commitment with a marker.
If a player does not have sufficient Resources or Commitment to pay
for a given action or choice, they may not perform it. However, if
required to lose Resources or Commitment beyond 0 (zero) because
of the other player’s actions, a player may not have a “deficit” inflicted on them—the index is lowered to 0 and the excess is ignored.
NOTES: Compared to the FLN, the Government player has a far
greater military capacity in terms of logistics, numbers of troops
and firepower. However, there will be problems not only of keeping
within budget, but also the practical issues of command and control,
the challenges of leadership and motivation in a largely conscript
military, and developing a workable counterinsurgency doctrine
– which includes improved coordination with law enforcement
and civilian agencies. This imposes a practical limit on what the
Government player can accomplish during a campaign - therefore
a finite amount of Resources.

2.0 Sequence of Play
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions on the Scenario Guide (10.0) to choose a
scenario and various play options, prepare the draw deck, and set
up markers and forces.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile.

NOTE: All played cards and the number of cards in the draw deck
are open to inspection.

2.3 Event Card

When playing an Event card, the two Factions will execute Operations or the Event described on the card. At all times one player
will be First Eligible, and the other will be Second Eligible. In each
Event card round, the First Eligible player is first to choose what
they will do, followed by the Second Eligible—whose choices are
limited by what the First Eligible player did.

For the FLN, Resources are a more straightforward measure of
organization, training, and (especially initially) obtaining actual
weapons and equipment.
The Government player also has the
complication of a Commitment Level,
addressing the willingness of the Metropolitan French civilian population and
its government to continue to maintain
Algeria as a colony (technically and legally, Algeria was the 10th
Department of France, but the main effect of this measure was to
allow military conscripts to serve their term in Algeria, unlike the
just-concluded war in Indochina which permitted deployment only of
professional military and volunteers). He may deliberately raise or
lower the Commitment Level by sending or withdrawing forces to or
from Algeria in Propaganda Rounds. Certain in-game Events will
also change Commitment: for example, destroying FLN Bases, sustaining French casualties, using Torture, Event cards, and so forth.

1.9 Victory Markers

Similarly track with markers on the Edge Track the following totals
that affect victory (7.0).
•	 Government: Total Support (1.6.2) plus Commitment (1.8).
•	 FLN: Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus the number of FLN Bases on
the map.

2.3.1 Eligibility. Which player is First or Second Eligible is shown
on the Initiative Track by the placement of that player’s cylinder
on the diagram.
2.3.2 Options for Eligible Factions.
First Eligible:

The First Eligible player may play the Event, conduct an Operation
with or without a special activity, or pass.
Once the player has completed the actions, place their eligibility
cylinder in the appropriate box on the Initiative Track as described
below:

•	 If they executed the Event card, place it in the “Event” box.
•	 If they conducted an Operation in only one location without a
special activity, place it in the “Limited Op” box.
•	 If they conducted an Operation in more than one location without
a special activity, place it in the “Op Only” box.
•	 If they conducted an Operation (in any number of spaces) with a
special activity, place it in the “Op + Special Activity” box.
•	 If they passed, they receive one or two Resources (see 2.3.3) and
place it in the “Pass” box.

Colonial Twilight

Second Eligible:

The Second Eligible player may then choose one of the boxes
adjacent to the First Eligible player’s cylinder and conduct actions
as described below:
•	 If they chose the “Event” box, they may execute the Event card.
•	 If they chose the “Limited Op” box, they may conduct an
Operation in one space without a special activity.
•	 If they chose the “Op Only” box, they may conduct an Operation
in any number of spaces without a special activity.
•	 If they chose the “Op+Special Activity” box they may conduct
an Operation in any number of spaces with or without a special
activity.
•	 If they chose the “Pass” box, they gain the appropriate amount of
resources.

2.3.3 Passing. A player who Passes will take no further action that
round. They receive +1 Resource if FLN or +2 Resources if Government. As an exception to 2.3.2 above, both players may Pass,
in which case both receive Resources and the order of eligibility
does not change.
2.3.4 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is an Operation in
just one location, with no Special Activity. If the Limited Operation
is a Garrison (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2), it can involve
pieces from multiple spaces but only one destination space.
2.3.5 Adjust Eligibility. After the players have completed all
execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events (or after
both players have Passed), adjust cylinders on the Initiative Track
as follows:
•	 If the First Eligible player chose to execute an Operation with a
Special Activity, or an Operation in multiple locations, the Second
Eligible player becomes the new First Eligible player, and places
the eligibility cylinder appropriately. (Note that these two boxes
on the Initiative Track are shaded differently to remind players
of this change of eligibility.)
•	 If the First Eligible player did anything else (Limited Operation,
Event or Pass), they remain First Eligible.

Clarifications:
•	 “Location” in the above rules also refers to the France Track and
Border Zone Track, which are not map spaces but which can be
chosen for Train and Rally Operations (3.2.1, 3.3.1). For example,
if the FLN player selected both the France Track and one map
space to conduct a Rally, they would be considered to have chosen
an Op Only (that is, an Operation in multiple spaces).
•	 The Second Eligible player may select only one location to
conduct an Operation or Operation with a Special Activity when
permitted by the First Eligible player’s choice. They must select
only one location when required to do a Limited Operation by
the First Eligible player’s choice.
2.3.6 Next Card. After both players have chosen and executed an
option, reveal the draw deck’s next card. Play the newly revealed
card, proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
2.3.7 Pivotal Events. Each player begins the scenario with one or
more unique Pivotal Event cards. Pivotal Events are a type of Event
(5.0) that can be played deliberately. Either player may play a Pivotal
Event to replace the currently played Event card if:
•	 Any pre-conditions listed on the card are met, AND
•	 The First Eligible player has not yet chosen an option (2.3.2).

Revised May 2018

If both players want to play a Pivotal Event at the same time, the
Second Eligible player gets priority and plays their card. The First
Eligible player keeps their card to play later.
Procedure: Playing a Pivotal Event card changes the normal sequence of play. The player playing the Pivotal Event card places it
on the played Event card and executes the Pivotal Event instead.
The Pivotal Event card stays in the played card pile (exception:
the Government Pivotal Event card Coup d’Etat is retained by the
player after the Event is executed. The card may be played up to
once per Campaign (5.1.7).
The player who played the Pivotal Event card becomes or remains
First Eligible: adjust the cylinders if necessary, and place the player’s
cylinder in the “Event” box of the Initiative Track. The other player
may choose either an Operation with a Special Activity or Pass, and
becomes or remains Second Eligible.

2.4 Propaganda Card

If playing a Propaganda card, conduct a Propaganda Round (6.0),
following each phase on the Propaganda Card Sequence of Play
(6.1 to 6.5).
2.4.1 Final Propaganda. If the last Propaganda card’s Round is
completed without a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine victory
by 7.3.
NOTE: Each series of Event cards ending with a Propaganda
Round is a “Campaign”, representing one to two years of conflict.
In games where all Propaganda Rounds are played, the player
with the highest victory margin is the one in the dominant position
in the just-concluded peace negotiations. The game analogue to
the real-world historical outcome would be a situation like this:
neither player wins outright, but the FLN player has the higher
victory margin.

3.0 Operations
3.1 Operations in General

A player executing an Operation (Op) chooses one of the four Operations listed on their sheet and selects the map spaces (typically
several) to be involved. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation. Operations usually cost Resources, often per space
selected; the player must have enough Resources to pay for the
Operation, including in each selected space. The executing player
chooses the order of the spaces in which the Operation is resolved,
the enemy pieces to be affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces
to be placed, replaced, or moved. Once targeted, enemy pieces are
affected to the maximum extent possible.

3.1.1 Pawns. If desired, mark spaces selected for Operations (3.0),
Special Activities (4.0), or other actions with white and black pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Operations
or Special Activities: they cost no Resources. EXCEPTIONS:
Pacification and Agitation still cost Resources even if part of a free
Operation (3.2.1, 3.3.1). Other requirements and procedures still
apply unless modified by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).

3.2 Government Operations

The Government player chooses from Train, Garrison, Sweep, and
Assault Operations.
3.2.1 Train. Training adds Algerian forces and can also build Support
(1.6) and/or affect certain Tracks. The Government player may select
Cities, Sectors that have a Government Base, or the Border Zone or
France Tracks (each Track counts as one location). The Government
player may not select the Border Zone Track until Morocco and
Tunisia have become independent (5.1.8).
NOTE: French pieces move in and out of Algeria via the Deploy
Special Activity (4.2.1) and Events (5.0), not Train.
Procedure: First, pay two Resources per selected location. Then,
in those selected locations:

•	 If a Sector with a Government Base or City, place up to four
Algerian cubes (any combination of Troops and Police). If none
of the desired pieces are Available (1.4.1), they may be taken from
spaces elsewhere in Algeria. Then, in one selected space (even if
a Limited Operation, 2.3.4), if desired:
	 ◊	 Pacify to remove any Terror marker or markers, and then to
shift the space one level toward Support. The space must have
Government Control. The Pacification costs two Resources per
Terror marker removed or level shifted, even if the Training
Operation was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
	 ◊	 Note that when the Recall de Gaulle Pivotal Event card is in
effect (5.1.7), the Government player may now select Populated
Sectors that have Government Control and Troops and Police,
in addition to Cities and Sectors with a Government Base. The
player may still Pacify in only one space.
•	 If a Track, do not place any cubes but shift the Track’s status
marker one box. The marker may be moved at most one box on
the track.
3.2.2 Garrison. Garrisoning moves Police among populated and
Resettled (4.2.1) spaces, to find enemy pieces there. Pay two Resources total (not per space). If a Limited Operation (2.3.4), all
moving cubes must end on a single destination space.
Procedure: Move up to six Police cubes between any number of
selected spaces. Then, in one of the selected spaces (whether or not a
Police cube just moved in or out), Activate one Underground Guerrilla for each Police cube there; in Mountain spaces, Activate one
enemy Guerrilla for every two Police cubes (round odd totals down).
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweeps may move Troops and can locate Guerrillas.
Pay two Resources per space selected.
Procedure: First, move any adjacent Troops (not Police) desired
into selected spaces. Then, in each selected space, Activate one
Underground Guerrilla for each cube (Police and Troops) there. In
Mountain spaces, Activate only one Guerrilla for every two cubes
(round odd totals down).

EXAMPLE: In Mostaganem (V-4), there are: one Police cube, one
Troop cube, two Underground Guerrillas, and one FLN Base. The
Government player pays two Resources for a Sweep, naming Mostaganem as the destination space, and moves three Troop cubes
from adjacent Sidi Bel Abbes (V-3) into the space. Because there
are now five Government cubes in Mostaganem, and because it
is a Mountain space, up to two Underground Guerrillas could be
Activated there – so both Guerrillas are Activated.
3.2.4 Assault. Assaults remove enemy pieces. Select any spaces with
Government cubes and FLN pieces. Pay two Resources per space.

Revised May 2018

7

Procedure: In each selected space, remove enemy pieces per the
number of cubes there, as follows:

•	 Remove one enemy piece for each Troop cube, or one for every
two Troop cubes in Mountain spaces (round odd totals down);
•	 In Cities and Border Sectors, count Police as well as Troops; in
other Sectors, Troops only.
•	 Removed Guerrillas go to the Available and Casualties boxes
alternately, Available first.
•	 Removed Bases go to Available. For each Base removed, add one
Commitment.
Guerrillas first, Bases last: Remove any Active Guerrillas first,
then any FLN Bases only once no Guerrillas remain. Remove no
Underground Guerrillas (1.4.3).
NOTE: Underground Guerrillas in a space prevent further removal
via Assault of Bases until the Guerrillas are Activated.
DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less hard hitting than Troops but
enjoy an information advantage in that counterinsurgents must
Activate (locate) them before Assaulting them.
ASSAULT EXAMPLE: Continuing on from the above Sweep example, the FLN player was unable or unwilling to change any of
the circumstances in Mostaganem during that turn. So now, the
Government player declares an Assault there, with the four Troop
cubes; because the space is Mountain, up to two FLN pieces will
be removed. Government pays two Resources, and removes both
Activated Guerrillas. The first Guerrilla is removed to Available,
the second to Casualties.

3.3 FLN Operations

The FLN player chooses from Rally, March, Attack, or Terror
Operations.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally adds FLN forces and can also build Opposition
(1.6) and/or affect the France Track. The FLN player may select
any Algerian Sectors, Cities at Neutral or Opposition, Morocco or
Tunisia (if these countries are independent, (5.1.8), or the France
Track (the Track counts as one location).
Procedure: First, pay one Resource per selected location. Then, in
those selected locations:

•	 If a Sector, City or Country, place one Available Guerrilla OR
replace two Guerrillas with a Base (within stacking limits, 1.4.2).
If the space already has at least one Base, the FLN may instead
place Guerrillas up to the sum of the space’s Population Value
(1.3.2-.4) plus the number of Bases there, or flip all its Guerrillas
there Underground (1.4.3). Then, in one selected space (even if a
Limited Operation, 2.3.4), if desired:
	 ◊	 Agitate (6.3.2) to remove any Terror marker or markers, and
then to shift the space one level toward Opposition. The space
must have an FLN Base or FLN Control. The Agitation costs
one Resource per Terror marker removed or level shifted, even
if the Rally Operation was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
•	 If the France Track, do not place any Guerrillas but shift the
Track’s status marker one box. The marker may be moved at most
one box on the track.
3.3.2 March. March Operations move Guerrillas. Moving pieces
may begin in any spaces. Pay one Resource per space that Guerrillas
move into. A Limited Operation (2.3.4) March may select only a
single, adjacent destination space.

8

Colonial Twilight

Procedure: The FLN moves any Guerrillas desired into adjacent
spaces (1.3.5). Guerrillas moving from one space to another move as
a single group. Unless a Limited Operation (2.3.4), Guerrillas may
make any number of March moves, until a Wilaya or International
Border is crossed. At that point, no further March moves may be
taken by that group of Guerrillas. Set all Guerrillas of a moving
group to Active (1.4.3) if:
•	 The space moved into is at Support (1.6) or the moving group is
crossing an International Border, and
•	 The moving group’s number of pieces plus the number of Government cubes at the destination exceeds three. (If the group is
crossing an International Border, add the current Border Zone
Status to the number of Government cubes.)
EXAMPLE: Two Underground Guerrillas March from Saida (V-5)
into Sidi Bel Abbes (V-3), where there are two Police cubes and
Support. The total of four relevant pieces at the destination exceeds
three, so the Guerrillas flip to Active. The Guerrillas may continue
Marching into Oran or Mostaganem (V-4) by paying one more
Resource, since either is in the same Wilaya.
EXAMPLE: The FLN player Marches two Guerrillas from Morocco
into Mecheria (V-1), where there is one Police cube. The Border
Zone Status is “1”. Because the total involved is four (2 Guerrillas
+ 1 Police + 1 Border Zone Status), the Guerrillas are set to Active.
If the FLN had Marched only one Guerrilla, it would have stayed
Underground. In either case, the FLN cannot continue Marching
because the piece(s) crossed an International Border.
3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces.
Select any spaces where there are Guerrillas and enemy pieces; pay
one Resource per space.
Procedure: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the Guerrillas
there and then roll a die. If the roll is less than or equal to the number
of Guerrillas there (whether or not they began Active), remove up
to two enemy pieces (Police first, then Troops, then Bases: FLN
player’s choice whether French or Algerian within each type). For
each Base removed, subtract one Commitment.
Casualties: Place any pieces removed by Attack into the Casualties
box.
Attrition: For each French piece removed, the FLN must also remove one Guerrilla from the space (exception: not when combined
with Ambush, 4.3.3). Removed Guerrillas go to the Available and
Casualties boxes alternately, Available first.
Captured goods: If the die roll was a “1”, place one Underground
FLN Guerrilla in the space.
DESIGN NOTE: Selecting Police first represents the FLN’s prudent reluctance to engage the Government elite troops head-on,
and to defeat their security forces in detail through many small
ambushes and raids on isolated outposts held by police and sector
troops. “Attrition” represents heavy return fire and the disproportionate casualty ratios that nevertheless occurred in engagements
with the French Army, who had access to artillery and airpower.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Cities or Sectors
affect Support and Opposition (1.6) and place Terror
markers that hinder future efforts to influence it. Select
any spaces where the FLN has at least one Underground
Guerrilla; pay one Resource per space.

Revised May 2018

Procedure: Activate one Underground Guerrilla in each selected
space.
•	 If the space has no Terror marker, place a Terror marker. Set the
space to Neutral.
•	 Do not place a Terror marker if all are already on the map. (There
are 12.)
NOTE: Terror Operations will not add Terror markers to spaces
that already have them.

4.0 Special Activities
4.1 Special Activities in General

When a player executes an Operation (3.0), they may also execute
one of its Special Activities (exception: Limited Operations, 2.3.4).
There is no added Resource cost for the Special Activity unless
specified. As with Operations, the executing player selects spaces
or pieces affected and the order of actions. Select a given space only
once as a location for a given Special Activity. Events may grant
free Special Activities.
Important: A player may execute a Special Activity at any one time
immediately before, during, or immediately after its accompanying
Operation.
EXAMPLE: The FLN Rallies until at 0 Resources, then pauses to
Extort and gain Resources, then continues to Rally in added spaces.
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities either must occur or may not occur where
their Accompanying Operations occurred. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operations and take place
in any otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 Government Special Activities

The Government player may choose from Deploy, Troop Lift, or
Neutralize Special Activities.
4.2.1 Deploy. This may accompany Train.
Procedure: The Government player may move up to six French
pieces among the Available box and up to three selected spaces.
Spaces must be Cities, or Sectors with Government Bases or Government Control.
or

The Government player may Resettle one Sector that
has Pop 1, and a Government Base or Government
Control. The Government player places a “Pop 0”
marker on top of the Sector’s Population Value on the
map, adjusts the Resettled Sectors marker on the Edge Track, and
removes any Support/Opposition marker that was there.
A Resettled Sector is now treated as a Pop 0 Sector
in all respects but one: the Government player may
still Garrison there. The FLN player may not Extort
or conduct Terror there, and the Sector is permanently neutral (1.6). In future Propaganda Rounds, the
Government player will subtract Resources equal to the number of
Resettled Sectors (6.2.1).
NOTE: In the Full Scenario, the Government player may not Resettle Sectors until after they have played the Mobilization Pivotal

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Colonial Twilight
Event. Also, note that some Sectors have already been Resettled at
the beginning of the Medium and Short scenarios.
DESIGN NOTE: Forced resettlement of indigenous populations
is a common method to deal with insurgencies: if you conceive of
the guerrillas as fish, you can catch them by draining the ocean.
In the Algerian War over 2 million Algerians (over 25% of the
Muslim population) were forced to leave their homes. Most were
placed in internment camps in primitive conditions, others were
placed in villages in areas firmly controlled by French forces.
In game terms, this physically prevents large numbers of people
from actively helping the FLN; on the other hand, these people
are now antagonized against the authorities that forcibly removed
them from their traditional villages and farms, and these same
authorities must use soldiers and resources to keep them confined.
And no, there is no method for the Government player to “put
them back.”

9

Revised May 2018

Procedure: Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3), the Attack
in that space Activates one Underground Guerrilla only. It automatically succeeds (do not roll) but removes only one enemy piece (using
the same order of precedence as in Attack: Police first, then Troops,
then Bases). For each Base removed, subtract one Commitment.
Attrition (3.3.3) does not apply in Ambushes: if a French piece was
removed, do not also remove the Guerrilla.

5.0 Events

Each Event card bears a title, italicized flavor text, and Event text.
Flavor text provides historical interest and has no effect on play.
Card
Number

4.2.2 Troop Lift. This may accompany any Operation. Troop Lift
moves Troops, especially to mass them quickly for an Operation.
Procedure: Move any French Troops (only) among any three Algerian spaces (certain Events may increase or decrease the number
of selected spaces).
4.2.3 Neutralize. This may accompany Garrison or Sweep. Neutralize destroys exposed FLN pieces. It may take place in up to two
spaces, in any space that has both Government Troops and Police
in it (Control is not necessary).
Procedure: Remove a total of up to two Active enemy pieces from
among all selected spaces. Remove Bases only from spaces where
no other FLN pieces remain. Remove no Underground Guerrillas.
Removed Guerrillas go to the Available and Casualties boxes alternately, Available first. Shift each space selected one level toward
Opposition; if the space is already at Oppose, it stays at Oppose but
place a Terror marker (if one is not already there). For each Base
removed, add one Commitment.

4.3 FLN Special Activities

The FLN may choose from Extort, Subvert, or Ambush Special
Activities.
4.3.1 Extort. This may accompany any Operation. Extort enables
the FLN to gain Resources from areas they inhabit. They may Extort
in any spaces with Pop 1 or more that have both at least one Underground Guerrilla and FLN Control (1.7, includes Morocco and
Tunisia when these countries become independent, 5.1.8).
Procedure: For each selected space, Activate one Underground
Guerrilla there (1.4.3). Add 1 to FLN Resources (1.8).
4.3.2 Subvert. This may accompany Rally, March, or Terror (3.3.1,
-.2, -.4). Subversion removes Algerian cubes, or replaces them with
Guerrillas. It may take place in up to two spaces, with at least one
Underground Guerrilla and any Algerian cubes.
Procedure: Remove a total of up to two Algerian cubes (Troops or
Police) from among the selected spaces, or in one space replace one
Algerian Police cube with an Underground Guerrilla. Removed or replaced pieces go to Available. Note that the Guerrilla is not Activated.
4.3.3 Ambush. This may accompany Attack (3.3.3). Ambush enables
the FLN to ensure the success of an Attack. It may take place in
up to two spaces that have both been selected for an Attack not yet
resolved, and have at least one Underground Guerrilla.

5.1 Executing Events

When a player executes an Event, they carry out the Event text
literally (sometimes involving actions or decisions by the other
player). Unless otherwise specified, the executing player makes all
selections involved in implementing the text, such as which pieces
are affected or which player will execute a Free Operation (5.5). If
another player is specified or selected to take an action, that player
decides the details of the action. Some Events with lasting effects
(Capabilities) have markers as aids to play.
5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence.
EXAMPLE: The shaded text on Card #37, Integration allows
the FLN player to carry out a free Subvert, without the normal
requirement to do an Operation or have an underground Guerrilla
in the space.
However:

•	 Events may not violate stacking (e.g. do not place Bases where
there are already two, nor Government forces outside of Algeria,
1.4.2 – though there is an Event card that permits placing up to
three Bases in Morocco and Tunisia).
•	 Events place only available pieces (1.4.1) and markers unless
specifying from Out of Play or Casualties; they remove rather than
replace if the replacement is not Available or if stacking (1.4.2)
would be violated.
•	 Events may not raise Resources beyond 50 (1.8).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence.

5.1.3 An executed Event’s text that can be implemented must be
implemented. If not all of its text can be carried out, implement
that part which can.
5.1.4 Pivotal Events are Events that have preconditions for play and
pre-empt other Event cards. Either player may play a Pivotal Event
card at the beginning of the turn, before the First Eligible player
has chosen an action. The player who plays a Pivotal Event card
executes that Event instead of the ordinary Event card, and becomes
or remains First Eligible. See 2.3.7.

Revised May 2018

it is now impossible to play it. Government adds two Commitment
and six Resources.
5.1.6 MOBILIZATION Pivotal Event
This card is used only in the Full Scenario. It may not be played
unless the total of Opposition plus FLN Bases is equal to or greater
than 15.
•	 When executed, the Government player may immediately move
any number of pieces from Out of Play to Available, up to onehalf the current Commitment Level (round up), at no cost in
Commitment.
•	 Also, from this point on, the Government player may Resettle
Sectors (4.2.1) and the FLN player may play the Morocco and
Tunisia Independent Pivotal Event (5.1.8).

5.1.7 RECALL DE GAULLE Pivotal Event
This card may not be played unless the Coup d’Etat Pivotal Event
card has been played at least once. When it is played, it stays in effect
for the rest of the game unless cancelled by a subsequent play of
Coup d’Etat. The card has three effects while in play:

Sample Pivotal Event card
Government: Coup d’etat, Mobilization, Recall De Gaulle
FLN: Morocco and Tunisia Independent, OAS, Suez Crisis
5.1.5 COUP D’ETAT Pivotal Event
Unlike other Pivotal Events, this card is kept by the Government
player after playing it. It may be used multiple times but no more
than once per Campaign (2.3.7).
To execute the card, each player rolls 1d6.

•	 If the Government player rolls higher: both the Recall de Gaulle
and/or OAS cards are cancelled if in play. Remove these cards
from the game. Add Commitment equal to the lower of the two
die rolls, and add Resources equal to the sum of the two rolls.
•	 If the FLN player rolls higher, they may choose to remove Troops
or subtract Commitment. In either case remove cubes or subtract
Commitment equal to the lower of the two die rolls. Troops
removed may be taken from the map or Available, and are placed
in Out of Play (FLN may choose which Troop cubes to remove,
but if FLN removes Troops there is no change in Commitment).
•	 If the rolls are tied, there is no change (but the card is considered
to have been played).
The Recall de Gaulle Pivotal Event may not be played until Coup
d’Etat has been played at least once during the game. It is considered
to have been played already at the beginning of the Short Scenario.
EXAMPLE 1: The Government player plays Coup d’Etat. Both
players roll 1d6: Government gets a”3”, and FLN gets a “4”. FLN
decides to remove Troops, chooses three Troop cubes from the map
and places them in Out of Play.

EXAMPLE 2: The Government player plays Coup d’Etat while
Recall de Gaulle is in play. Both players roll 1d6: Government
gets a”4”, and FLN gets a “2”. Recall de Gaulle is removed from
play; OAS is also removed even though it was not in play, because

•	 In addition to being able to select any City or Sector with a
Government Base for Train, Government may now also select
any Populated Sector with Government control and Troops and
Police (but may still Pacify only one selected space per card and
one shift per Pacify).
•	 In the Resources and Commitment Adjustment Phase of the
Propaganda Round (6.2.1), the number of French pieces in the
Available Box no longer adds to Government Resources, and
French Casualties no longer affect the Commitment Level.
However, Government now does receive Resources equal to Total
Support.
•	 It permits the FLN player to play the OAS Pivotal Event (5.3.1).
5.1.8 MOROCCO AND TUNISIA INDEPENDENT Pivotal
Event
This card may not be played unless Mobilization (5.1.6) has been
played. When it is played:
•	 Morocco and Tunisia become FLN sanctuaries. These two Country
spaces are treated as Mountain Sectors that are always at Oppose
and under FLN Control. FLN pieces may not enter these spaces
until after the card is played, and Government pieces may never
enter these spaces. The FLN player may now execute Rally or
March in these spaces, and may also Extort in them since they
have a Population Value of 1 (though these Population Values are
never added to the Total Opposition, 1.6.3). Also, the FLN player
may not take pieces from Morocco or Tunisia if placing forces
that are not available elsewhere (1.4.1).
•	 The Government player places the Status marker in the “0” box
of the Border Zone Track. They may improve (move towards “4”)
the Border Zone Status through Train Operations. The Border
Zone Status will move towards “0” in the Reset Phase of each
Propaganda Round.
•	 From now on, Police in Border Sectors count as Troops in Assaults
(3.2.4).
DESIGN NOTE: The Border Zone represents the construction
of the Morice Line, a barrier built to prevent infiltration to and
from Morocco and Tunisia. In most places this consisted of an
eight-foot tall electrified fence protected by continuous barbed
wire entanglements and minefields on either side of it. The line
was constantly patrolled by large numbers of soldiers, who were
guided to infiltration attempts by systems of alarms, radars,

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Colonial Twilight

Revised May 2018

5.3.1 OAS

searchlights and air surveillance.
The Morice Line was effective but took a long time to complete
and consumed a large amount of resources. Years later the United
States contemplated building a similar “McNamara Line” to
prevent infiltration of South Vietnam. To a lesser extent, the Border Zone also represents the presence of the French Navy, which
patrolled the Mediterranean to prevent insurgent movement and
supplies into or out of Algeria by sea.
5.1.9 SUEZ CRISIS Pivotal Event
This card has no preconditions (except that, per 1.8, the FLN player
must have at least six Resources to satisfy its execution). When the
FLN player plays the card, the Government player removes 1d6
French Troops from map spaces and/or Available (his choice which)
and sets them aside. Both players subtract six Resources.
In the next Propaganda Round, the FLN player (only) will receive
six Resources in the Resource Phase. The French Troops removed
will return in the Redeploy Phase. The Government player may
place them in any Cities or spaces with friendly Bases, at no cost
in Commitment.

5.2 Dual-Use

Many Events have both an unshaded and shaded Event text. The
executing player may select either the unshaded or shaded text to
carry out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the Government, a player may select either text option.
DESIGN NOTE: Dual-Use events represent opposed effects of
the same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject
to alternative historical interpretation.

11

The card may be played only if the Recall de Gaulle
Pivotal Event card is already in effect. It is automatically cancelled if Recall de Gaulle is cancelled, and
it may also be cancelled by executing the Change in
Tactics card.

When the card is executed its provisions come into effect and may be
used by either player in place of any Special Activity they perform
(the player must perform an Op & Special Activity; they may not
do an Op-only or LimOp and use the capability).
•	 Select one non-Terrorized Populated space in Algeria. Place a
Terror marker there and set the space to Neutral.
•	 Subtract Commitment equal to the Population Value of the space.
Subtract FLN Resources equal to twice the Population Value of
the space.
Reminder: refer to 1.8. If a player does not have sufficient Resources
or Commitment to pay for a given action or choice, they may not
perform it. However, if a player is required to lose Resources or
Commitment beyond zero because of the other player’s actions, they
may not have a “deficit” inflicted on them – the index is lowered to
zero and the excess is ignored.
5.3.2 TORTURE
Either player may execute this Event card to bring the
card’s two provisions into play.
DESIGN NOTE: This does give the Government player a shortterm military advantage but acts against him politically, so it could
be to either player’s advantage to execute the Event.

5.4 Momentum

5.3 Capabilities

Dual-Use Events marked “GOVERNMENT CAPABILITY” or
“FLN CAPABILITY”, have lasting effects mainly relating to that
player. When executing such an Event, place the corresponding
marker on the appropriate side (unshaded or shaded) in the Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the rest of the game (exception:
there is one Event that removes a Capability).
There are two Dual-Use capabilities, OAS and TORTURE. When
either of these cards is executed it is in effect for the rest of the game
(unless cancelled by executing the “Change in Tactics” Event card).
PLAY NOTE: Set out executed Capabilities Event cards near the
affected player(s) as added reminders.
There are small markers supplied to remind
players of the effects of certain Capabilities
in certain spaces. The “Taleb/Amateur Bomber” markers are placed in the three City
spaces, while the “Napalm/Commandos de Chasse” markers are
placed in Mountain Sectors.

Event text (unshaded, shaded, or both) marked “GOVERNMENT
MOMENTUM” or “FLN MOMENTUM” also includes lasting
effects for that player (there are also Event cards marked only
“MOMENTUM”, because they have effects on both players). When
executing such text, place the card in view near the draw pile. It has
effects specified to last until the next Propaganda Round’s Reset
Phase (6.5), when the card is discarded.
NOTE: Any number of Momentum Events can be in play simultaneously.

5.5 Free Operations

Some Events allow a player an immediate Operation or Special
Activity that interrupts the usual sequence of play and typically is
free: it bears no Resource cost and does not affect Eligibility (3.1.2,
2.3.1), though other procedures and restrictions remain unless modified by Event text (5.1.1).
NOTE: Pacification and Agitation cost Resources even if part of free
Operations (3.2.1, 3.3.1). A free Ambush Special Activity occurs as
if an Attack were occurring in the space (4.3.3).

6.0 Propaganda Rounds

Conduct a Propaganda Round in
the sequence of phases below.
Exceptions: Never conduct more
than one Propaganda Round
in a row (without at least one
Event card in between). Instead,
additional Propaganda cards are
played without a Propaganda
Round. Do not conduct a Victory
Phase on the first Propaganda
Round. If this is the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1), end the
game after the Support Phase and
determine victory (7.3).

6.1 Victory Phase

Do not conduct a Victory Phase on the first Propaganda Round. If
any player has met their victory condition, the game ends. See Victory (7.0). Otherwise, continue with the Propaganda Round. After
conducting the final Propaganda card’s Round (2.4.1), determine
victory per 7.3.

6.2 Resources and Commitment Adjustment
Phase

Follow these steps to add to the relevant player’s Resources or
Commitment, to a minimum of 0 or a maximum of 50 (1.8).
6.2.1 Government Resource Adjustment.
Add to Government Resources:

•	 The current Commitment Level.
•	 For each Sector (not City) with Government Control and at least
one Government Base in it, Resources equal to the Population
Value of the Sector.
•	 The number of French pieces in the Available box (but not if the
Recall de Gaulle Pivotal Event is in effect (5.1.7).
•	 Total Support (but only if the Recall de Gaulle Pivotal Event is
in effect (5.1.7).
Subtract from Government Resources:
•	 The number of Resettled Sectors.
6.2.2 FLN Resource Adjustment.
Add to FLN Resources:

•	 The number of FLN Bases on the map.
•	 The indicated “+Resource” number of the current box on the
France Track.
Subtract from FLN Resources:

•	 The Border Zone Status number (if Morocco and Tunisia are
independent).
NOTE: This represents interference of the French Navy and the
border interdiction zones in preventing supplies and trainees
arriving for the FLN.
6.2.3 Commitment Adjustment.
•	 Move any number of French pieces from Out of Play to Available,
and subtract Commitment equal to one-third of total French pieces
moved (round up).
•	 Move any number of French pieces from Available to Out of Play,

Revised May 2018

and add Commitment equal to one-third of total French pieces
moved (round down).
•	 Subtract Commitment equal to one-third of total French pieces
in the Casualties box (round down) (do not do this if Recall de
Gaulle Pivotal Event is in effect (5.1.7).
•	 Subtract the “-Commit” number from the current box on the
France Track.

6.3 Support Phase

Players may spend Resources to affect popular Support and Opposition (1.6).
6.3.1 Pacification. The Government player may expend Resources
to build Support in any space with Government Control and Troops
and Police. Every two Resources spent removes a Terror marker
or—once no Terror is in a space—shifts the space one level toward
Support, to a maximum of two levels per space. The Government
may not spend more Resources in this Phase than the current Commitment Level (1.8, 6.2.3). (See also Train, 3.2.1)
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police or local militias together
provide the security needed to gain popular support.
6.3.2 Agitation. The FLN player may spend Resources to build
Opposition in any spaces with FLN pieces and no Government Control (1.7). Every one Resource expended removes a Terror marker
or—once no Terror is in a space—shifts the space one level toward
Opposition, to a maximum of two levels per space.
6.3.3 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.1), end
the game and determine victory (7.3). Otherwise, carry on with the
Redeploy and Reset Phases.

6.4 Redeploy Phase

Redeploy forces as follows. Government player goes first. Do not
adjust Control until finished.
6.4.1 Government Redeploy. The Government player may move any
Troops on the map to any Cities or spaces with friendly Bases. Any
Police on the map may move to any Government Controlled spaces.
6.4.2 FLN Redeploy. The FLN player may now move any Guerrillas
from any space or spaces within a given Wilaya, to any other space
or spaces within the same Wilaya with a friendly Base or Bases.
DESIGN NOTE: The FLN leaders for each Wilaya were mistrustful of one another, jealous of their resources and not well
coordinated or commanded by the FLN headquarters, which was
outside of Algeria. Players may still March their Guerrillas into
different Wilayas during campaigns, and there is an FLN Capability which allows them to Redeploy from any spaces in Algeria
to any other spaces in Algeria with a friendly Base.
6.4.3 Control. Now adjust Control (1.7) to reflect the above moves.

6.5 Reset Phase

Take one in three French pieces and one in three Guerrillas (round
down, player’s choice exactly which) in the Casualties box and put
them in the Out of Play box. Put all other Casualties into their respective Available boxes. Then prepare for the next card as follows:

•	 Move the France Track marker one box toward “A”. Move the
Border Zone Status marker one box towards “0” (5.1.8).
•	 Remove a Terror marker from each space where there is at least
one (3.3.4).

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Colonial Twilight
•	 Flip all Guerrillas Underground (1.4.3).
•	 Place any Momentum cards that were in effect onto the played
cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
•	 Set the cylinders on the Sequence of Play chart diagram to show
the FLN is First Eligible.
•	 Play the next card from the draw deck (2.3.6).

7.0 Victory

Each player has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Player Aid sheets.

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

If no player reaches their victory condition by game end, or both
players have reached their victory conditions, the player that reached
the highest victory margin (7.3) wins. Ties go to the FLN.

7.2 During Propaganda Rounds

Check victory at the start of each Propaganda Round except the
first (6.1). Compare the positions of the two Victory markers (1.9)
to the thresholds marked on the Edge Track. Victory conditions are:
Government: Total Support (1.6.2) plus Commitment (1.8) exceeds
35.

8.0 Non-Player Faction Rules

This section governs actions in games where there is a single human
player who does not wish to play both factions. The player will play
the Government faction and the Non-Player Sequence of Play aid
sheet will direct the player on what to do when the FLN acts. See
also the Playbook’s 1-Player Examples of Play.
Important: For the one-player game of Colonial Twilight, it is
strongly recommended that the Player sets up the Short Scenario
as the rules have been optimized for this scenario.
NOTE: the Non-Player Sequence of Play aid sheet is presented in
the form of a flowchart meant to assist the single human player in
determining the FLN’s actions. While great care has been taken to
cover a great deal of possible cases, it cannot realistically be expected for the guidelines to anticipate, cover or otherwise prescribe for
every circumstance possible during a game. Players are respectfully
encouraged to use their imagination or, in extreme cases, common
sense to resolve these situations.

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

To use the flowchart, begin at “Start”, and follow the arrows per the
answers to “diamond” questions until an action is found.

•	 Empty Threat: No effect (reveal at game end).
•	 Hidden Agenda: Permanently add +1 to the holding player’s
victory margin (7.3).
•	 Hidden Asset: Convert any one Limited Op option (2.3.4) into a
full Op & Special Activity option instead. The player may choose
to use this marker if they are able to choose a Limited Op due to
their eligibility (2.3.2); if the player was First Eligible, they remain
First Eligible (that is, the player’s cylinder remains in the Limited
Op space on the Initiative Track). Discard the marker after use.

•	 To the extent permitted by the Sequence of Play and per the
priorities detailed in the sequential steps (1, 2, etc.) within the
flowchart boxes, conduct each action to the fullest extent until
eligible spaces or Resources run out.
•	 Many actions contain tie breaker clauses in bold [green]. The tie
breakers are used if and as needed, one by one in the order given
(a, b, etc.), to narrow the number of spaces already selected down
to the number needed.
•	 Text in italics [red] is not a priority but a reminder of relevant
rules of play.
•	 Operations Possibly Limited. Unlike other games in the COIN
Series, the Non-Player options are subject to the rules of the
Sequence of Play as detailed in 2.0: the Non-Player only gets
those options that are available to it per the Sequence of Play.
Remember that the First Eligible player’s cylinder on the Initiative
Track is placed in accordance with what the player actually did;
so if, after all was said and done, a First Eligible Non-Player
conducted an Operation in only one space and conditions did
not permit any Special Activity, the cylinder would be placed
in “Limited Operation”. Correspondingly, if the Non-Player is
Second Eligible, its choice of available options will be limited
by what the Player did.
•	 Special Activities. If the Non-Player is First Eligible, and it is
to execute an Operation, it will also perform a Special Activity
if (and only if) the relevant Non-Player priorities lead it to do
so (and so become Second Eligible next card) and that option is
available per the Sequence of Play.
•	 Low Resources. When the Non-Player begins the turn with zero
Resources, and will not or cannot execute the Event or Extort, it
Passes instead (earning Resources, 2.3.3).

You have read all rules needed for a two-player game, or a game
with one human playing both factions.

8.1.1 Operations, Special Activities, and Events. To execute
FLN Operations and Special Activities or a specific Event, see the
Non-Player Sequence of Play flowcharts and the relevant rules
below.

FLN: Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus number of FLN Bases on the
map exceeds 30.

7.3 After Final Propaganda

If the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1) is completed without a victory
check win (7.2), the player with the highest victory margin wins.
The victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or short of its
condition set forth in 7.2.

NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
or surpassed its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
Government: Total Support + Commitment – 35.
FLN: Total Opposition + Bases – 30.
Victory Deception Option: For a bit more “fog of
war”, each player at start blindly draws two Deception
markers. Set aside the rest; they may not be inspected. Players may reveal their Deception markers only
as they use them:

Stop!

Guidelines: Unless otherwise specified, carry out whatever actions
apply to the maximum extent (such as with the most pieces allowed
and only as long as needed pieces and Resources are available).

Colonial Twilight

Normal Resource costs, requirements, and procedures still apply.
EXAMPLE: Non-Player Terror requires Activating an Underground
Guerrilla and costs one Resource per space, per 3.3.4.
8.1.2 Procedure Guidelines. When conducting Events or Operations
and Special Activities, unless otherwise specified by the Event text or
the Non-Player priorities, the Non-Player FLN will follow these general guidelines (still always within the dictates of the rules of play):

•	 Place friendly pieces from Out of Play first, then from Available
(if choice); place Bases before Guerrillas
•	 Place Underground Guerrillas before Active ones unless if placing
from the map in which case place Active Guerrillas only (flipping
them Underground in the process).
•	 March with Underground Guerrillas before Active, unless the
March is certain to Activate the Guerrilla in which case March
with Active before Underground Guerrillas.
•	 Place Guerrillas in spaces at Support, otherwise where there are
other friendly pieces already; if unable, then place in random
spaces (see 8.2).
•	 When placing from the map (e.g. during a Rally), place Active
Guerrilla pieces (and Active only) from the map to other spaces
on the map (as per 1.4.1). Thereby
	 ◊ never remove either of the last two Guerrillas from any FLN
Base nor from a Support space.
	 ◊ remove first from where there are the most Guerrillas.
•	 Remove and replace Guerrillas before Bases, Active Guerrillas
before Underground.
•	 If there is a choice, remove enemy pieces from the map then from
Available; remove enemy Bases, then French before Algerians,
then or within that, Troops before Police.
•	 If there is a choice, reduce Commitment first, then Support,
then the France Track (toward box “F” only), then Government
Resources.
•	 Shift Support/Opposition where achieving the greatest shift in
Support and Opposition combined first (removing Terror markers
only if also able to achieve a shift), otherwise affect shifts of
Support first, then Opposition.
•	 Otherwise make space and other selections randomly (see 8.2).
8.1.3 Abbreviations and Terminology Used. The flowcharts and/
or the priorities below make use of the following abbreviations and
terminology (in the alphabetical order).
1+, 2+, etc. = One or more, two or more, etc.

1d6 ÷ 2$ = The roll value of one six-sided die divided by two,
rounding down.
AND: The use of the capitalized “and” indicates that both sides of
the conjunction must be realizable and/or true, for the conjunction
as a whole to be evaluated (as true or as executable).
Max = Maximum.
Op (+SA) = Operation (and Special Activity, if and as instructed by
the Non-Player priorities).
OR: The use of the capitalized “OR” indicates that at least one side
(or both) of the disjunction must be realizable and/or true, for the
disjunction as a whole to be evaluated (as true or as executable).
Res = Resources.

Revised May 2018

Will/ Would: The “will” and “would”, as used in some of the “diamond” questions, refer to what will or would definitively happen
were an action executed according to the relevant Non-Player action
instructions.

8.2 Random Spaces

If several candidate spaces have equal priority for a Non-player
Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select a space using the Random Spaces Map:

•	 Roll the two dice in succession and refer to the Random Spaces
Map: the first die thrown indicates the “tens”, the second die the
“ones” (Example: “2” followed by “6” is 26, Laghouat). If the
first die is a “6”, roll again.
•	 If the resulting space is not a candidate, follow the arrows on the
Random Spaces Map until a candidate space is reached. Loop
back to Morocco from Tunisia (or vice versa).
•	 Carry out as much of the action as possible in the candidate space
reached, then roll again to select another, if needed.
PLAY NOTE: More simply, choose among a few candidate spaces
by die roll instead.

8.3 Executing Events

NOTE: Events will not always benefit the FLN directly.

•	 FLN executing a Dual-Use Event (5.2) will always use the shaded
text except when otherwise specified in the Event Instructions
printed on the of the flowchart (see card #51. Stripey Hole).
•	 FLN executes the text of all Non-Dual-Use Events (e.g. #52.
Cabinet Shuffle) as if it were shaded, unless the Event Instructions
specify otherwise.
•	
Some Event cards have a symbol printed on them to indicate
that the FLN will always play them (if able per the Sequence
of Play, 2.0) and/or that there are instructions for the card printed
in the “Events Marked for FLN” section of the Player Aid.
•	 For free Operations or Special Activities afforded by Events, use
the FLN priorities for that Operation or Special Activity (8.4).
•	 Capabilities (5.3) and Momentum (5.4). The FLN will always
opt for Capability Events (regardless of which Faction’s Capability
it is). They only opt for Momentum Events if instructed to do so
by the “Events Marked for FLN” section of the Player Aid.
•	 Ineffective Events. The FLN will opt only for Events the playing
of which by the FLN would have an effect (something happens,
including Capabilities and certain Momentum Events).
•	 When there is a choice of who gets Event benefits the FLN always
selects itself for a benefit first, then to inflict disadvantage on the
Government.
•	 Pivotal Events. The Non-Player FLN will play the Morocco and
Tunisia Independent Pivotal Event after the Government player
plays the Mobilization Pivotal Event, at the first opportunity where
the just revealed Event is marked for FLN AND FLN are second
Eligible. The Non-Player FLN will never play the Suez Crisis or
OAS Pivotal Events. If the Government player plays the Coup
d’Etat Pivotal Event and the FLN wins the die roll, choose to
reduce Commitment by the lower die roll.
INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: The FLN is First Eligible and
the Event card is Change in Tactics. No Capabilities markers are
yet in play. The Event would have no effect, so the FLN moves on
to consider an Attack, possibly with Ambush.

8.4. Non-Player FLN Actions
Select the FLN actions as follows.

8.4.1 Pass. If the FLN has 0 Resources AND only a Limited Operation is available to it, then Pass (for an additional Resource, 2.3.3).
8.4.2 Terror. If the Pass conditions are not met, and either all Algerian FLN Bases in spaces with a Population of 1 or more have two or
more Underground Guerrillas in them AND all Algerian FLN Bases
in 0 Population spaces have one or more Underground Guerrillas in
them, OR if the Government has already selected an action that puts
it Second Eligible on the next card, then attempt to execute Terror
as follows. Otherwise, skip straight to Rally (8.4.5) now.
When conducting the actions below, execute them such that FLN
will not Activate the last Underground Guerrilla in a space with an
FLN Base (so exposing the Base). FLN will pause to Extort if at 0
Resources and Extort is possible.

•	 First, if the current Event is playable by FLN per the Eligibility
order AND the playing of the Event by FLN would reduce the
Government victory margin more or as much as Terror per the
next bullet below would, do not conduct Terror but skip straight
to 8.4.3 Event below now.
•	 Otherwise, FLN will execute Terror whereever it can remove
Support (if short on Resources, select the spaces with highest
Population Value first).
•	 Then, if the Terror Operation is taking place in the final Campaign (that is, the next Propaganda Card will be the last one of
the game), FLN will also execute Terror in any spaces that are
currently Neutral and Pacifiable (that is, in a City or Sector with
Government Base, or, if Recall de Gaulle is in effect, also in a
Sector with Troops and Police and Government Control). Select
spaces with the highest Population Value first if Resources are
insufficient to execute Terror everywhere. NOTE: Terror does not
place more Terror markers to spaces that already have at least one
(3.3.4).
When finished, and if a Special Activity is permitted, conduct Subvert, or failing that, Extort, as below.
If none: If no Terror is possible, consider playing the current Event
per 8.4.3 below.
Subvert: Subvert (4.3.2) as follows, acting in up to two spaces with
an Underground Guerrilla and an Algerian cube: first, in up to two
spaces, to remove a space’s last cube or cubes choosing spaces to
remove Police first, then Troops; otherwise, in one space, replace one
Algerian Police with a Guerrilla. Finally, only if Subvert above has
already removed pieces OR the Government was active on the current card already, and Subvert has not yet occurred in the maximum
number of allowed spaces, then Subvert choosing targets randomly.
If there are no spaces possible for Subvert as detailed above, Extort
as below. If Subvert was not possible, conduct no Special Activity.
Extort: FLN will never Extort if its Resources are at 5 or more (in
which case it considers Subvert, or if already did so, conducts no
Special Activity). FLN may Extort in any populated spaces with an
Underground Guerrilla and FLN Control (4.3.2), but FLN will never
Extort to Activate the last Underground Guerrilla in a space with
an FLN Base (so exposing the Base). Within the above conditions,
FLN will Extort first at spaces with two or more Guerrillas (3 or
more Guerrillas if Government cubes and an FLN Base are in the
space), then in Morocco and Tunisia; finally, only if FLN is still
at 0 Resources, FLN Extort everywhere possible. If there are no

Revised May 2018

15

spaces possible for Extort as detailed above, Subvert as above, or
if an Attack without Ambush was conducted, conduct no Special
Activity. If Extort was not possible, also conduct no Special Activity.
8.4.3 Event. If no Terror occurred, the FLN will consider playing
the current Event (provided the Event is Effective AND per the
Eligibility order FLN may play the Event) as follows:

•	 If the Event is marked for FLN play (8.3), or it is a Capability
Event (of either Faction), FLN will play the current Event (per
Event Instructions as detailed on the Player Aid, if any).
•	 Otherwise, FLN will play the current Event if they roll 1, 2, 3, or
4 on a 1d6 AND the FLN’s play of the Event will either:
	 ◊	 reduce the Government’s victory margin, or their Resources,
or shift the France Track toward box “F”.
	 ◊ place FLN Bases or add to FLN Resources.
If none: If the Event is not played, check to see if the Attack conditions are met.
8.4.4 Attack. If the Event was not played and an Attack (with or
without Ambush) would remove two or more French pieces, then
Attack as follows.
When conducting the actions below, execute them such that FLN
will not Activate the last Underground Guerrilla in a space with an
FLN Base (so exposing the Base).

•	 First, Attack everywhere, with Ambush if and as needed, where
FLN will certainly (that is, with groups of six or more Guerrillas,
or with Ambush) remove a Government piece or pieces. Select
spaces so as to remove pieces in this order of priority: Bases (for
–1 Commitment, 3.3.3); French Troops; French Police; the most
pieces. NOTE: The normal rules of play still apply: in individual
spaces, Attacks must remove Police first, then Troops, then Bases
(3.3.3).
•	 Then, Attack in one space with at least four Guerrillas and a
Government piece. Select the Attack spaces per the priority order
given in the bullet above.
When finished, and if a Special Activity is permitted and no Ambush
occurred yet, conduct Ambush, or failing that, Extort per 8.4.2 above.
If none: If no such Attack is possible, check to see if the Rally
conditions in 8.4.5 below are met.
Ambush: Ambush (4.3.3) in the first two spaces selected above per
the Attack priorities. If no Ambush occurred, Extort per 8.4.2 above,
otherwise conduct no Special Activity.

8.4.5 Rally. If the conditions for Terror, Event play, or Attack were
not met, and either a Rally (in the first or second bullet below) would
place at least one Base OR the number of FLN Bases on the map
(both in Algeria and abroad) multiplied by two is greater than the
number of all Guerrillas in spaces with FLN Bases (Underground
or Activated, in Algeria and abroad) plus 1d6 divided by two (round
down), then Rally as follows.
Stopping when whichever limit is reached first, FLN will Rally in
up to six spaces, or expend up to two-thirds (round down) of its
Resources in doing so (unless FLN begins the Operation with 8

16

Colonial Twilight

or fewer Resources, in which case it observes no limit). FLN will
pause to Extort if at 0 Resources (whether at the start or during the
Operation) and Extort is possible. Finally, at the end of the Rally,
FLN will Agitate, if able (per the bullets 6 or 9 below).
Important: In the course of executing the priorities below, FLN will
never Rally to place a second FLN Base in any space in Algeria.
Important: When conducting the Rallies below, place Guerrillas
until none are left in Available, then from the map (as detailed in the
fifth bullet of 8.1.2 above), and finally, during Rallies thereafter, flip
Active Guerrillas at FLN Bases Underground. Within that, place or
flip Guerrillas such that at most the Population Value of the space
plus 1 Guerrillas, at least one of them Underground, will exist in
each Base space. (See Playbook’s 1-Player Example of Play.)
•	 First, in all spaces with three or more Guerrillas, no Government
cubes (ignoring this condition if conducting a Limited Operation
per the Sequence of Play) and room for a Base: replace two
Guerrillas with a Base, replacing Active Guerrillas if possible (as
per 8.1.2).
•	 Then, in all spaces with four or more Guerrillas and room for
a Base: replace two Guerrillas with a Base, replacing Active
Guerrillas if possible.
•	 Then, at all spaces with FLN Bases with no or one Underground
Guerrillas, but in Morocco or Tunisia and in spaces with 0
Population only if no Guerrilla is Underground there: place
Guerrillas (first selecting spaces in Algeria, then or within that, in
spaces with cubes, then or within the above, where there is one or
more Population, then or within the above, where there are least
Guerrillas Underground).
•	 Then, shift the France Track marker (3.3.1) toward box “F”, if
able.
•	 Then, at all non-City spaces at Support that have no Underground
Guerrilla: place Guerrillas (in highest Population Value spaces
first).
•	 Then, if able (at FLN Control or Base), select and reserve
Resources to Agitate at the conclusion of this Rally Operation,
in a space with 2+ Population (conducting also a Rally there if
none yet).
•	 Then, in up to two spaces with the highest Population Value: place
Guerrillas (first in a Neutral space where able to gain FLN Control
in, then or within that, where able to remove Government Control,
that is, to make the space Uncontrolled or FLN Controlled, then
or within the above, in a Wilaya with a City and, then or within
the above, prioritize spaces with the least Terror markers).
• Then, in up to two spaces where Guerrillas and no FLN Base
already exist: place Guerrillas (first selecting spaces in Algeria,
then or within that, in spaces where there are the largest number
of Guerrillas, and then or within both of the above, where there
are no Government Cubes).
•	 Finally, if no Agitation space was selected in the 6th bullet above,
Agitate for the greatest possible shift in one space with FLN
Control or a Base (conducting also a Rally there if none yet).
When finished, if a Special Activity is permitted, conduct Subvert,
or failing that, Extort per 8.4.2 above.
If none: If no such Rally is possible, then March. If a March was
not possible either, Pass (8.4.1).
8.4.6 March. If the conditions for Rally were not met, then March
as follows.

Revised May 2018

FLN will expend up to two-thirds (round down) of its Resources in
doing a March (unless FLN begins the Operation with 8 or fewer
Resources, in which case it observes no limit) pausing to Extort if
at 0 Resources (whether at the start or during the Operation) and
Extort is possible. When conducting the actions below, execute them
such that FLN will not March the last Underground Guerrilla, or
either of the last two Guerrillas, from any FLN Base space, nor will
it March the last Guerrilla from any space at Support. FLN will not
March so as to trigger Government Control of any populated space.
Important: Unless Dead Zones is in effect (5.4), if and as helpful
to fulfilling any of the priorities below, FLN will use the ability of
Guerrillas to March again even if they just Marched but are still in
the same Wilaya (3.3.2). Also, if and as helpful, FLN will March
out of Morocco and/or Tunisia (even if becoming Active due to
the Border Zone Track, 1.3.4, 1.3.7) as well as combine Marching
Guerrillas from multiple source spaces to enter single destinations.
Also keep in mind the third bullet of 8.1.2 for instructions on the
March order of Active versus Underground Guerrillas.
•	 First, March to get one Underground Guerrilla to each FLN Base
in Algeria that does not have one (prioritize spaces to which the
March costs the least).
•	 Then, March one Guerrilla to each space at Support (or two
Guerrillas to up to one City space if the Amateur Bombers
Capability is in effect) if no Guerrillas are there already. (If
multiple candidates, March first to where the marching pieces
will stay Underground, then or within that, prioritize spaces to
which the March costs the least.) Important: Except in the final
Campaign (that is, the next Propaganda Card will be the last one
of the game), FLN will March into spaces at Support even if this
sets the Guerrilla to Active due to the number of cubes there.
•	 Then, March to remove Government Control (that is, with enough
Guerrillas to make the space Uncontrolled) in one populated
Sector not at Oppose (if there is a choice, March first to a Mountain
space, then or within that, take the one with the highest Population
Value and, then or within the above, the space to which the March
costs the least).
•	 Then, March exactly three Guerrillas (possibly from multiple
sources) to a non-Resettled Population 0 space with room for a
Base (first where there are the fewest Government Cubes, then
or within that, to a Mountain space, then or within the above, to
the space to which the March costs the least, then or within the
above, prioritize the March during which at least one Guerrilla
stays Underground).
When finished, if a Special Activity is permitted, conduct Subvert,
or failing that, Extort, as detailed in 8.4.2 above.
If none: If no such March is possible, then Rally. If a Rally was not
possible either, Pass (8.4.1).

8.5 Propaganda Round Procedures for the NonPlayer Faction

8.5.1 Resources and Commitment Phase. If this is the final Propaganda Round, the 1-Player game ends at the end of this phase.
Judge Victory as in 8.6.
Optional rule: For a different kind of challenge and lesser difficulty,
conduct the full final Propaganda Round as normal.
8.5.2 Support Phase. If this is the final Propaganda Round,
Non-Player FLN will conduct all Agitation (6.3.2) they can.
Otherwise, FLN will expend up to two-thirds (round down) of its

© 2017 GMT Games, LLC

Colonial Twilight
Resources. If Resources are insufficient for Agitation everywhere
it is possible, Agitate first for the greatest shift, then where Support,
then where fewest Terror markers, then randomly. Remove Terror
only if a shift would be achieved.
8.5.3 Redeploy Phase. FLN will Redeploy to get at least the Population Value plus 1 Guerrillas in each Base space, but having no
more than three Guerrillas per space with a Base. Otherwise, spread
Guerrillas as evenly as possible between Base spaces, within the
pieces’ current Wilaya. If the CROSS-WILAYA REDEPLOYMENT
Capability is in effect, FLN will Redeploy to get the Population
Value plus one Guerrillas, but not more than three in each Base
space across Algeria.
IMPORTANT: FLN will never Redeploy the last Guerrilla of a
Support or City space.

8.6 One-Player Victory

A one-player game ends during a Propaganda Round Victory Phase
(7.2) only if the Non-Player Faction has a positive victory margin. To
win, the player must avoid that situation through each Propaganda
Round and have the higher margin after the final Round. If not, the
FLN wins the game.
Non-player victory: An armistice is concluded with total independence for a new Algeria, which becomes a symbol of Western
humiliation and a source of inspiration for continued anti-colonial
revolt across Africa.
Player victory: If the player does survive to the final Round with
the higher victory margin, subtract the FLN Victory Margin from
the player’s to find the degree of success:
5 or less – Negotiated Future. Algeria does win a form of independence from France, but neither the stability nor good governance of
the new country is guaranteed.
6 or more – Vive la France! Diplomacy and strong-arm methods
have extinguished the virus of armed revolt. Algeria continues as
an integral part of France, now and forever.
EXAMPLE: A solo Government player keeps the FLN from reaching
a positive victory margin through all Propaganda Rounds. At game
end, with Support + Commitment at 30, Government has a –5 Victory Margin. Oppose + Bases is 24, for an FLN Victory Margin of
–6. This is a difference of 1, for a Negotiated Future. A very closely
negotiated future...

10.0 Scenario Guide

Choose a scenario and decide who will play
which side. Give each player a Faction foldout. Set up the pieces and prepare the card
deck per the instructions below for that scenario. The FLN player starts as First Eligible
in all scenarios.
In the Short and Medium scenarios, some
Event cards will be set aside. They will not
be used and may not be inspected. Optionally, sort through the unused Event cards and
reveal the ones that confer Capabilities – unshaded for the Government and shaded for the
FLN (players must agree whether or not to
implement #18, Torture, at game start). Place
markers appropriately; these are in effect at
the beginning of the game. The other cards are
not used and may not be inspected.

Short: 1960-1962: The
End Game

Deck: Give the Coup d’Etat and OAS Pivotal
Event cards to the Government and FLN player respectively. The Recall de Gaulle Pivotal
Event starts in play. Shuffle 36 random Event
cards and divide into three piles of 12 Events,
shuffle one Propaganda card into each pile,
and stack the piles. Set aside the remaining
Event cards.
