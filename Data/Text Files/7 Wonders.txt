Game overview and goal
A game of 7 Wonders takes place over 3 Ages, each using one of the 3 card
decks (first the Age I cards, then Age II, and finally Age III).
These Ages are each played similarly, with each player having the opportunity
to play 6 cards per Age to develop his or her city and build their Wonder.
At the end of each Age, each player compares their military might with their
two neighboring cities (belonging to the players to their right and left).
At the end of the third Age, the players count their victory points ; the
player with the most points wins the game.

Game Elements
Wonder Boards
Each board represents the Wonder the player can build and the resource
it produces from the start of the game (shown on the upper left of the
board). These boards are double-sided and offer two different versions
of the Wonder. Each Wonder is composed of two, three or four stages,
represented on the board. Each stage has a construction cost and gives
a bonus when finished.

Game Set-up
One deck of cards per Age

Cards cost
The area in the upper left indicates the construction cost. If that area is
empty, the structure is free and requires no resources for its construction.
Example : the Marketplace is free, the Mine costs one coin, the Baths
require one stone to be built and the Arena requires two stones and
one ore.

Coins
The coins come into play in commercial transactions tying a city to its two
neighboring cities.
There is no limit to the number of coins a player can accumulate during a game.
Accumulated coins are worth victory points at the end of the game.

Conflict Tokens
The Conflict tokens are used to represent the military victories and defeats
between neighboring cities.
4 types of tokens are used :
• the Defeat tokens with a value of -1 are used at the end of each of
the 3 ages.
• the Victory tokens with a value of +1 are used at the end of Age I.
• the Victory tokens with a value of +3 are used at the end of Age II.
• the Victory tokens with a value of +5 are used at the end of Age III.

Starting in Age II, some structures can be built either by paying the requisite
resource(s) or, alternatively, they can be built for free if the player has built
during the previous age the structure indicated on the card.
Example : the construction of the Stables requires one brick, one wood
and one ore OR possession of the Apothecary.

3 Players  : 5 Guilds
4 Players  : 6 Guilds
5 Players  : 7 Guilds
6 Players  : 8 Guilds
7 Players  : 9 Guilds

Note :
- If you have correctly removed the cards at the beginning of the game,
all of the cards in play should be dealt at the beginning of each Age (7
cards per player).
- For inquiring minds, the number of Guilds to be kept is equal to the
number of players +2.

Wonders

Cards
In 7 Wonders, all the Age cards represent structures.
There are 7 different types of structures, easily recognizable by the border color of their card.
• Raw Materials (brown cards) : these structures produce resources :

For each of the 3 decks, return to the box all cards which are not used
based on the number of players.
Example : in a 6 player game, the 3+, 4+, 5+ and 6+ cards are used. The
7+ cards are returned to the box.
Moreover, for the Age III deck :
• Remove the 10 Guilds (purple cards) and randomly (and secretly) keep
only the number required based on the number of players.
• Then, shuffle the kept Guilds cards kept with the other cards to make
up the Age III deck.

The lower right area indicates which structures (if any) may be built for
free in the following age due to this card.
Example : if built during Age I, the Scriptorium will allow the building of
the Library and the Courthouse for free during Age II.

Shuffle the 7 Wonder cards, face down, and hand one to each player. The
card and its facing determine the Wonders board given to each player as
well as the side to be used during the game.

• Manufactured Goods (gray cards) : these structures produce resources :
• Civilian Structures (blue cards) : these structures score victory points.
• S cientific Structures (green cards) : these structures score victory
points depending on your progress in the three scientific fields :
• C ommercial Structures (yellow cards) : these buildings earn coins,
produce resources, change commerce rules and sometimes earn
victory points.
• Military Structures (red cards) : these buildings increase your military
might. This comes into play during Conflict resolution.
• Guilds (purple cards) : these buildings allow players to score points
according to specific criteria.
Note : the Age III deck contains no Raw Materials (brown cards) or Manufactured Goods (gray cards), but it does contain the Guilds (purple cards).

The lower center area indicates in which configuration – number of players
– the card is used.
Example : in a 4 player game, the 3+ and 4+ cards are used.

Notes :
- For your first few games, you should use side A of the boards, as they
are simpler to use.
- If all the players agree, the Wonders boards can be chosen instead of
randomly given.

Coins
Each player begins the game with 3 value “1” coins which they place on
their board.
The remaining coins form the bank (players may “make change” between
the value “3” and “1” coins as needed).

Conflict Tokens
The Conflict tokens form a reserve, next to the coins.

·3·

Construction in 7 Wonders

- its player can build the Barracks (cost : 1 Ore) or the Scriptorium
(cost : 1 Papyrus) as his city produces the required resources.

Throughout all 3 ages in a game, the players will get to build structures
(cards) and Wonders (board).
• Most structures have a resource cost. Some are free and some have
a coin cost. Some also have a resource cost and a free construction
condition.
• The Wonders all have a resource cost.

Coin Cost
Some brown cards cost a coin which must be paid to the bank on the turn
in which they are constructed.
Example : the construction of the Timber yard costs 1 coin.

Free Construction
Some cards have no cost and can be put into play for free.
Example : the construction of the Eastern Trading Post is free.

Resource Cost
Some cards have a resource cost.
To construct them, the player must produce the corresponding resources
AND/OR buy them from one of his or her two neighboring cities.

Production
The resources of a city are produced by its Wonder board, its brown cards,
its gray cards, and some yellow cards.
To build a structure, a player’s city must produce the resources indicated
on its card.
Example : Giza produces 2 Stones, 1 Clay, 1 Ore, 1 Papyrus and 1 Textile :

- its player cannot build the Aqueduct (cost : 3 Stones) as his city only
produces two of the three stones required by that structure.

Important : the resources are not spent during construction.
They can be used each turn, for the entire game. The production
of a city is never reduced (the cards played are never discarded).

Example A : a player wants to build a University (cost : 2 Wood +1 Glass +
1 Papyrus). Her city only produces a single Wood and a single Glass.
One of her neighbors produces a wood resource, while the other
produces a papyrus resource..
The player pays 2 coins to each neighboring player to gain their
respective resources and build her structure.
Example B : during a game turn, both neighboring cities buy from her 2
Stones for a total of 8 coins (2 per resource).
In the same turn, she can build a Library (cost : 2 Stones + 1 Textile)
thanks to her resources, even though she has sold them to her
neighboring cities.
Example C : the player mentioned previously would like to build a Forum
(cost : 2 Clay) ; she produces 1 Clay and a neighboring city also produces some.
At the beginning of her turn, she does not have enough coins in the
treasury. Even if the neighboring city buys one of her resources this turn,
she can’t spend the coins gained to immediately buy the missing Clay.
This money will only be available for commerce starting on the
following turn. The construction of the Forum is therefore impossible
this turn, the player will have to take a different action...

Commerce

Free Construction (Chains)

Often, a player will want to build a structure requiring resources he or
she does not produce.
If these resources are produced by a neighboring city – players sitting
directly to the left or right of that player – the player will be able to purchase the missing resource(s) through commerce.
The resources a player can buy from their neighboring cities are :
• the resources initially produced by the city (as indicated on the board)
• the resources from its brown cards (raw materials)
• the resources from its gray cards (manufactured goods)
However, it is impossible to buy the resources produced by some commercial structures (yellow cards) or by some Wonders : these resources are
reserved to their owner.
For each resource bought, the player must give 2 coins to the owner of
the resource.
Clarifications :
• selling a resource to a neighboring city DOES NOT prevent a player
from using it, during the same turn, for his own construction purposes.
• it is possible, during the same turn, to buy one or more resources
from both neighboring cities.
• the resources bought can only be used on the turn in which they
are bought.
• players can never refuse to sell resources.
• some commercial structures (yellow cards) reduce the monetary
costs of buying resources from 2 to 1 coin.
• if both cities neighboring a player produce a coveted resource, that
player is free to purchase from either player.
• to buy resources, the player must have the coins at the beginning of
the turn. The coins earned through commerce during a turn cannot
be used on that turn, only during the next one.

Some structures in Age II and Age III have, to the right of their resource
cost, the name of a structure of a previous age.
If the player has built the structure named there during a previous Age,
that player can build the structure for free, meaning without having to
fulfill the resource cost.
Example : the Library can be built for free during Age II if the player has
built the Scriptorium during Age I.

·4·

Example : built during Age I, the Theater allows a player to build the
Statue for free during Age II and this, in turn, allows a player to build the
Gardens for free during Age III.

Game Overview

A game begins with Age I, continues with Age II and ends with Age III. Victory points are counted only at the end of Age III.

Overview of an Age
At the beginning of each Age, each player receives a hand of 7 cards, dealt
randomly, from the corresponding deck.
Each Age is made up of 6 game turns. During each turn the players put into
play a single card, simultaneously.
A game turn takes place as follows :
• 1. Choose a card
• 2. Action
• 3. Give your hand of cards to the player sitting to your left or right
and receive another hand of cards from the player sitting next to you.

2.b. Build a Stage of a Wonder
To build each stage of his or her Wonder, the player will use a card of their
choice as a construction marker :
To do that, the player must pay the price shown on the Wonder board and
not the one shown on the structure’s card.
The player then plays the card, face down, half hidden under the Wonder
board to show that this stage of their Wonder is now built. The card then
has no other effect, and is not considered to be a structure.
Example : a player wants to build the second stage of his Wonder, the
Lighthouse of Alexandria. He chooses one card from his hand. His City
grants him the two units of Ore required for his construction, he therefore places his card in front of the wonder stage, half covered by his
board in order to indicate that this stage has been constructed.

1. Choose a Card
Each player looks at their hand without showing it to other players and
selects a card before placing it face down before them.
The remaining cards are placed between their left-hand neighbor and
themselves (see end of an Age).

2. Action
Once every player has selected his or her card, they perform their action
simultaneously.
Three actions are possible with the chosen card :
• a. Build the structure
• b. Build a stage of their Wonder
• c. Discard the card to gain 3 coins
Note : during your first game, you can follow the action of each player,
one after the other, to become more familiar with the game...

2.a. Build the Structure
Most often, the player will build the structure represented by the selected
card (see Construction in 7 Wonders).
Important : a player can never build two identical structures
(meaning those with the same name/the same illustration).
CARD PLACEMENT
The brown and gray cards are placed beneath one another starting
from the upper left corner of the Wonders board. This allows players
to quickly see all resources produced by each player.
The other cards are placed face up, in the area in front of the player’s
Wonders board. All of this area corresponds to a player’s city.
In order to save space, stack your cards by color while leaving the name
of each structure visible.

• d uring Age I, the hand of cards is passed to the player
sitting to the left (clockwise).
• during Age II, the hand of cards is passed to the player
sitting to the right (counter-clockwise).
• during Age III, the hand of cards is passed to the player
sitting to the left (clockwise).

Special case : sixth turn
At the beginning of the sixth and final turn of each Age, the players will
receive a two-card hand from their neighboring player.
Each player then chooses one (like in previous turns) and the second is
then discarded, face down.
The selected card is then played normally.
Then the Age ends.
Clarification : the unselected and discarded card is discarded without the
players getting 3 coins for it.
Example : Sophie gets a hand of 7 cards at the beginning of the first Age.
In the first turn, she puts into play one of her cards.
She then hands the remaining 6 cards to the player sitting to her left,
and gets a hand of 6 cards from the player to her right.
Later, during the sixth game turn, she gets a 2 card hand from the player
to her right. She discards one and puts the other one in play according
to the game’s rules.

End of an Age
Clarification :
• The stages of a Wonder MUST be built in order, meaning from left to right.
• the construction of the Wonder is not mandatory. A player can win
the game without having finished (or even started) the construction
of his or her Wonder.
• the card used to mark the construction of a Wonder stage remains
hidden. Players would be advised to use a card they do not want to
give their neighbor (see Move on to the next hand).
• most Wonders have 3 stages but these are not associated with Ages.
It is therefore possible to build multiple Wonder stages in a single
Age or to begin construction during age III.
• each stage can only built once per game.

2.c. Discard the Card to Gain 3 Coins
A player can choose to discard his or her card to take 3 coins from the bank
and add them to his or her treasury.
The cards discarded this way remain face down and form a discard pile in
the center of the table. It can be useful to discard a card you cannot build
but which would be of interest to your neighbor.
Note : if a player has chosen a card but is unable to build either the structure or the Wonder stage, that player is then forced to discard the card
and takes 3 coins from the bank.

3. Move on to the next hand
Each player takes the hand of cards handed from his or her neighbor.
Be careful : the direction of the hands rotation changes with
each Age :

·5·

Each Age ends after its sixth game turn.
The players must then proceed to the resolution of military conflicts.
Each player compares the total number of shields present on their military
structures (red cards) with the total of each of the two neighboring cities :
• If a player has a higher total than a neighboring city, that
player takes a Victory token corresponding to the Age just
played (Age I : +1, Age II : +3 or Age III : +5)
• If a player has a lower total than that of a neighboring city,
that player takes a Defeat token (-1 victory point)
• If a player has an equal total to that of a neighboring city,
no token is taken.
Each player therefore gets, depending on the situation, 0, 1 or 2 tokens
which are placed on his or her Wonder board.
Example : Age II has just ended. Alexandria (3 Shields) shares a border
with Rhodes (5 Shields) to the left, and Ephesus (2 Shields) to the right.
Alexandria takes a Defeat token (-1 victory point) and places it on the
left side of their board as well as a Victory token (+3 victory points,
Age II), placed on the right side of their board.

End of the Game

The game ends at the end of the third Age, after the Conflict tokens have
been handed out.
Each player totals their civilization points and the player with the highest
total is declared the winner.
In case of a tie, the player with the most coins in his or her treasury is the
winner. A tie on coins is not broken further.
Note : a booklet of scorecards is in the box to help you count the points
for your first few games... or keep track of your more memorable games !
Totalling the points

Count the victory points in this order :
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

1. Military conflicts
2. Treasury contents
3. Wonder
4. Civilian structures
5. Scientific structures
6. Commercial structures
7. Guilds

1. Military Conflicts
Each player adds their Victory and Defeat tokens (this total can be negative !).
Example : Alexandria has finished the game with the following tokens :
+1, +3, +5, -1, -1, -1 for a total of 6 points.

2. Treasury Contents

Sets of identical symbols

For every 3 coins in their possession at the end of the game, players score
1 victory point. Leftover coins score no points.
Example : Alexandria has finished the game with 14 coins in their
treasury, which earns them 4 victory points (4 sets of 3 coins plus one
partial set).

Each player adds the victory points of their Civilian structures. This amount
is indicated on each Civilian structure.
Example : Alexandria has built the following civilian structures : Altar
(2VP), Aqueduct (5VP) and Town Hall (6VP) for a total of 13 victory points.

For each of the 3 existing scientific symbols, the player wins the following
points :
• only 1 symbol : 1 victory point
• 2 identical symbols : 4 victory points
• 3 identical symbols : 9 victory points
• 4 identical symbols : 16 victory points
Note :
- the number of points gained is equal to the number of symbols squared.
- there are 4 green cards for each symbol, for a maximum of 16 victory
points per family of symbols.
- this maximum can be increased with the Scientific Guild and the Wonder of Babylon : 5 identical symbols earn 25 victory points and 6 identical symbols earn 36 victory points.
Example : Alexandria has built 6 scientific structures with the following
symbols : 3 , 2 , 1 . They score 9 points for the family of 3
(3x3), 4 points for its (2x2) and finally 1 for the (1x1), for a total
of 14 victory points.

5. Scientific Structures

Sets of 3 different symbols

The scientific cards earn victory points in two very different ways : from
sets of identical symbols and from sets of 3 different symbols.

For each group of 3 different symbols, each
player scores 7 victory points.
Example : Continuing the above example, Alexandria has built 6 scientific structures but only has a single group of 3 different symbols, they
score 7 extra points for a total of 21 victory points.
If Alexandria had built an extra structure with the symbol, they
would’ve scored : (9 + 4 + 4) + (7 + 7) = 31 victory points.

3. Wonders
Each player then adds to their score the victory points from their wonder.
Example : Alexandria has built all 3 stages of their Wonder (side A) ;
10  victory points (3 for the first phase and 7 for the third) are added to
their total.

4. Civilian Structures

Be careful : the victory points earned by both methods are
cumulative.

6. Commercial Structures
Some commercial structures from Age III grant victory points.
Example : Alexandria has built the Chamber of Commerce. This structure
is worth 2 victory points for each gray card present in their City. Alexandria has played two gray cards : 4 victory points.

7. Guilds
Each Guild is worth a number of victory points depending on the configuration of the player’s city and/or that of the two neighboring cities (see
description of the structures).

·6·

STRATEGIC ADVICES
• Block your opponents : to win at 7 Wonders, you must keep an eye
on your two neighboring cities to analyze their strategy. Try to block
them by using the cards which would give them an advantage. You can
use them to build your Wonder stages or by discarding them when
you need coins.
• Strategies : multiple strategies can lead to victory : specialize in structures of a single color or collect the different types of structures,
wage war or neglect your military, producing goods in abundance or
rely on commerce...
• The march of progress : if you build scientific structures, try to make
groups of different symbols, as they tend to earn more points.

“Expert” variant for 2 players

The following rule adjustments allow play with 2 players.
In addition to the standard game material, you’ll need the two specific
cards found in the box.
Be careful : we suggest you play a few games with 3-7 players
before trying the game in its 2-player variant !

Border card

Free city card

Game set-up
The players use the same cards as in the 3-player configuration (3+ cards only).
Each player is given a board, and then a third board is placed beside them.
This board will be called the Free city in the rest of this variant.
The Border card is placed between the two players.
Each player is given a 7-card hand and the remaining 7 cards make a draw
pile, placed face down, to the right of the Border card.
The player to the left of the Free city adds the Free city card to his or her hand.
The players and the Free city each get 3 coins from the bank to start the game.

Game Overview
The game proceeds the same way as it would with 3 to 7 players.
The difference is in the management of the Free city : the players will play,
in turn and in addition to their own card, a card for it.

Free city card

1. Choose a Card

3. Move on to the next hand

The player who holds the Free city card in his or her hand takes the first
card of the draw pile and adds it to their hand.
That player will then pick two cards from his or her hand, first one for their
own city and then one for the Free City, while his or her opponent picks
a card for themselves. Each player then places their remaining cards on
their own side of the Border card.
Each player then places the remaining cards on their side of the Border card.
Clarification :
The Free City cannot discard a card to get 3 coins unless it cannot play
a card. The player must then choose, when possible, a card which can
be played by the Free City (structure construction or wonder building
stage). The choice of this card is made AFTER choosing the card to be
played for his or her own city.

Once all three cards are played, the players take the stack of cards on the
other side of the border. During the next turn, it’s the other player who’ll
play for the Free city, and so on until the end of the game.
Example : Ludwig and Peter start a game. They each get a hand of 7
cards and place a draw pile made up of the 7 remaining cards 7 to the
right of the Border card. Ludwig, to the right of the Free city, adds to his
hand the Free city card. On the first turn of the game, Peter chooses one
card from his hand to play and Ludwig takes the first card of the Free
city draw pile and adds it to his hand. He then chooses one card for the
Free city and one for his own City. The players reveal their chosen cards,
starting with the Free city and play them. Then they take the stack of
cards on the other side of the Border card, so Peter winds up with the
Free city card for the second turn of the game. It’s therefore up to him
to draw a card and play for both his City and the neutral City...

Border card

End of an age

2. Action
The player holding the Free city card plays the Free city’s card followed by
his or her own while their opponent performs their own action.
Rules for the Free city :
• The Free City can buy resources from its two neighboring cities according to the normal commerce rules. When a resource is available in
both neighboring cities, the player controlling the Free City gets to pick
which city to buy the resource from (no matter what its cost may be).
• If the card chosen for the Free city can benefit from a free construction (chain), this free construction MUST be performed.
Note : during the sixth turn of the age, there is only one card remaining
in the Free city’s draw pile. This last card is discarded at the same time as
the seventh and last card of the players.

The player who begins with the Free city card changes each age :
• Age I : the card is held by the player to the left of the Free city.
• Age II : the card is held by the player to the right of the Free city.
• Age III : the card is held by the player to the left of the Free city.
The rules for Conflict resolution remain unchanged.

End of the Game
The player who has the most victory points wins the game.
In case of a tie, the player with the most coins in his or her treasury wins
the game.

Description of the Wonders

The 7 boards representing the Cities and their Wonders are double-sided (A and B) to allow for some variety in your games.

Side [A]

A

The A sides of the Wonders are organized according to the same principle :
• the first stage is worth 3 victory points.
• the third stage is worth 7 victory points.
• the second stage gives a special effect specific to the Wonder :
Clarification: the resources produced by the boards are not considered to be cards.

The Colossus of Rhodes

The Lighthouse of Alexandria

The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus

the player adds 2 Shields to their total in each conflict resolution.

the player gains a resource of their choice from the 4 Raw material types
[Stone, Clay, Wood, Ore] every turn.
Clarification : this resource cannot be sold through commerce.

the player takes 9 coins from the bank and adds them to their treasury.
Clarification : the 9 coins are taken from the bank only once, immediately
after this stage has been built.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon

The Statue of Zeus in Olympia

The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus

at the end of the game, the player gains an extra scientific symbol of
their choice.
Clarification : the choice of symbol is made at the end of the game, when
counting victory points, and not when this stage of the Wonder is built.

the player can, once per Age, build a structure of their choice for free.
Clarification : the player can place the card used as a construction marker
above the Wonder board and replace it underneath when this ability has
been used.

the player can look through all of the cards discarded since the beginning
of the game (those discarded for coins as well as those discarded at the
end of an age), pick one, and build it for free.
Clarification : this special ability takes place at the end of the turn in which
this stage is built. If players discard cards this turn (as in the case of the 6th
turn of an age), the player can also choose from among them.

The Pyramids of Giza
the Pyramids don’t have a special ability, their second stage is worth 5
victory points.

·8·

B

Face [B]
The B sides of the Wonders are slightly more complex. Nevertheless, both sides remain balanced and can be used in the same game.

The Colossus of Rhodes

The Lighthouse of Alexandria

The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus

The Colossus is built in 2 stages :
• the first stage is worth 1 Shield, 3 coins and 3 victory points.
• the second stage is worth 1 Shield, 4 coins and 4 victory points.

• the first stage allows the player to gain one resource of their choice
from among the 4 raw materials [Stone, Clay, Wood, Ore] each turn.
• the second stage allows the player to gain one manufactured good
of their choice chosen from among the 3 types [Glass, Textile, Papyrus] each turn.
• the third stage is worth 7 victory points.
Clarification : these resources cannot be bought by neighboring cities.

• the first stage is worth 4 coins and 2 victory points.
• the second stage is worth 4 coins and 3 victory points.
• the third stage is worth 4 coins and 5 victory points.
Clarification : the coins are taken from the bank only once, immediately
after the stage has been built.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon

The Statue of Zeus in Olympia

The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus

• the first stage is worth 3 victory points.
• the second stage gives the player the option of playing their seventh
Age card instead of discarding it. This card can be played by paying
its costs, discarded to earn 3 coins or used in the building of the third
phase of the Wonder.
• the third stage grants the player a scientific symbol of their choice.
Clarification :
- during the sixth turn, the player can therefore play both cards they have
in hand. If the second stage of the Wonder is not built, the Babylon player
can then build it on their sixth turn and then play the seventh card instead of discarding it.
- the choice of the symbol is made at the end of the game and not on the
turn in which the stage of the Wonder is built.

• the first stage allows the player to purchase raw materials [Stone,
Clay, Wood, Ore] from his or her two neighboring cities for the price
of one coin instead of two.
• the second stage is worth 5 victory points.
• the third stage allows the player to “copy” a Guild (purple card) of
their choice built by one of their two neighboring cities.
Clarifications :
- the first stage is equivalent to the two Trading Posts, Eastern or Western
(yellow cards) : their effect is not cumulative, but the construction of either
the Eastern or Western Trading Posts remains possible...
- for the third stage, the choice of the Guild is made at the end of the game,
when counting points. The player totals the victory points as if they had
built that Guild.
