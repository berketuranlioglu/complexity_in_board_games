2. Tips Regarding These Rules
This rules booklet may, at first glance, appear quite difficult to
understand and make the game seem more complex than it really is.
Please don’t let this deter you from learning this world class board
game. Unfortunately, a game of this complexity requires more than a
page or two of rules to describe it and much of the rules include
pictures and step-by-step examples to ensure ease of understanding
the game flow. This game will keep you interested right up to the
final round and guarantees wonderful replay value.
First, read through Section 3: Short Description of the Game
/ Aim of the Game and look through the game’s contents, referring
as you do so to Section 4: Explanation of the Game’s Contents.
This should enable you to grasp the principal mechanism of the
game, which is precisely described in Section 6.2.8: Converting

Meeting Markers into Votes. It may well help if you play through
the example given, using a State Board. Once you’ve done this, you
will have gained an understanding of the heart of the game and can
start playing.
The game is played over 7 rounds, each of which follows the
same course. You should play slowly through the first round, working
systematically from each section to the next. The importance of
each step is described at the start of each section in » italic type «.
Then follow the rules for each section. At the end of the game,
there is a final scoring round, which decides the winner of the game.
So, take the destiny of your party into your hands and lead them
to victory. If you can do it, you will be a true powerbroker, a true
“Macher”.

3. Short Description of the Game / Aim of the Game
» As a player, you have the task of leading your party through 7 state elections. Your most important aid in this is money. You need
money to place Shadow Cabinet Cards, to buy Media Markers, to buy Election Meeting Markers and to bid on Opinion Poll Cards. You
will need to be careful with your money though, because you will not get any more until the end of each round. «

3.1 The Election Campaign

Bid for Starting Player

Each player will represent one of the 5 traditional German
political parties. The parties are:

In every round, each player secretly writes down an amount of
money on their score sheet. This is their bid for the current round.
The player who bids the most amount of money may choose which
player is the starting player for the round. In some phases of the
game, it is an advantage to start and in others, the last player to play
has the advantage. A player may bid zero if they are not particular
about who goes first and if all players bid zero, then each player will
simply roll a die and the highest roll chooses who goes first.

CDU/CSU - Christian Democratic Union / Christian Social Union
SPD – Social Democratic Party of Germany
FDP – Free Democratic Party
Die Linken – The Left Party
Die Grünen – The Green Party
The game starts with a preliminary phase, which sets up a starting
position on the game board. This allows players to see what the first
four rounds will look like and do a little pre-planning to set
themselves up for the game. Once that is sorted out, the game then
officially begins with the first election round. The course of each
election round is as follows:

Party Platform Conference
Each player has a party platform determined by their Party
Policy Cards. This is the basis of their political campaign. In some
states this platform may not be very popular since the voters have
different views about these issues. Changing a party’s platform may
improve its chances in that state. During this phase, players have the
opportunity to do this, but may only change one Party Policy Card per
round. The number of coinciding Party Policy Cards to Public Opinion
Cards, also called the “Coincidence Rating”, is a direct factor in
determining the number of votes obtained in that state.

Shadow Cabinet

negative. This is a direct factor in determining the number of votes
obtained in that state.

The politicians in the Shadow Cabinet support the player during
the election campaign.
Appendix A lists the Shadow Cabinet
members associated with each picture. The game includes cards
which represent various members of a Shadow Cabinet that allow the
player to carry out certain actions to either benefit their campaign
or disrupt another player’s campaign. The more expensive the card,
the more it can affect the outcome in a certain state. The cards
offer the following types of actions:

Convert Party Meeting Markers into Votes
The conversion of the Party Meeting Markers into votes is given
by the following formula:
Votes = Meeting Markers x (Coincidence Rating + Popularity Rating)

So, in order to gain a lot of votes in a state, a party should have a
high number of Party Meeting Markers in the state, a positive
Popularity Rating and a high Coincidence Rating.

Collect Votes
Cause one issue to become a key issue for that state

3.2 Winning an Election

Force other players out of the media

Score Current State

Improve the public’s opinion towards your party

Once the campaign is over, the number of votes the party
received is converted into seats. The votes received also decide
which party or coalition has won the state. Seats won are worth
victory points which directly lead to winning the game. The winner of
the election also gets some further advantages in that they may
place a Media Marker on the top of the National Board and, in
addition, can influence the National Opinion. Both lead to further
victory points at the end of the game. Coincidence between Party
Policies and National Opinions can also lead to more Party
Membership. For this reason, it is important to try to win some of
the state elections. Simply coming in second every round will not get
you the bonus points from the Media Markers and National Opinion.

Worsen the public’s opinion towards other parties

Form Coalitions
Two players may form a coalition for a single election in one
state. This improves the chances of winning the election since the
votes for both parties are counted together. In order to form a
coalition, the two parties must have at least two Party Policy Cards in
common in their platform. This may be another reason for a player to
change a Party Policy Card in the Party Platform Conference phase
mentioned on page 5.
Buy Media Markers

Collect Money

Buying Media Markers increases your party’s ability to speak
directly to the public. As a result, your party has more opportunity
to convince the public that your Platform is the correct one for that
state. The player who has the plurality of the Media Markers in a
state may change one Public Opinion Card in that state. Ideally, the
newly chosen Public Opinion Card coincides with a Party Policy Card in
your platform, which will earn more votes and improve the chances of
an election victory.

At the end of each round (excluding the 7th), the players receive
new cash. The amount of cash that a player receives depends on
their success in the preceding election and on their Party
Membership (in rounds 1, 3 and 5). This cash enables the player to
compete in later elections. However, any player who finds that they
have cut things too fine may be able to improve their financial status
by taking a contribution from an outside body. This carries a risk,
however, in that accepting outside contributions may cause some
party members to stop supporting you throughout the election. Once
all cash has been paid out, the current round is over.

Organize Party Meetings
Party Meetings are the basis for the gathering of votes. Each
player has only a limited number of Party Meeting Markers, so it is
important to divide them between the various states in a planned and
timely manner to maximize the number of votes earned.

3.3 The End of a Round
At the end of each round of the game (excluding the 7th) a few
changes must be made to the boards to set-up for the next round.

Auction Opinion Polls

3.4 Aim of the Game

Opinion polls are offered to each highest bidder every round
for possible publishing (1 poll auctioned per state). This is a chance
for each player to improve the public’s opinion towards their party
and/or worsen the public’s opinion towards other parties. This is
called the “Popularity Rating” and it can be either positive or

The game ends after the 7th round. Players get victory points by
winning seats in the state elections, having influence over the
National Media, having strong Party Membership and having a strong
coincidence between your Party Platform and the National Opinion.

4. Explanation of the Game’s Contents
4.1 Cards and Tiles
Party Policy Cards
The Shadow Cabinet cards allow the player to carry out certain
actions to either benefit their campaign or disrupt another player’s
campaign. The members of the Shadow Cabinet are listed in
Appendix A. Each card has;

These cards represent the
policies that form your
party’s platform.
There
are seven policies that are
the major issues of this
election and they are
explained in more detail in
Appendix A. The policies
with a dark background
represent a “NO” (:) or
“LESS” (ª) policy.
The
policies
with
a
light
background represent a “YES” (;) or “MORE” (©) policy.

4. A list of the possible actions that the
card can be used for.

Opinion Poll Cards
Public Opinion Cards

The Opinion Poll cards can either improve the party’s popularity with
the public or worsen an opposing party’s
popularity with the public. Each card
has;

These
represent
the
opinions of the electorate
for each of the proposed
policies. The opinions with
a
dark
background
represent either “NO” (:)
or “LESS” (ª).
The
opinions with the light
background
represent
either “YES” (;) or
“MORE” (©).

1. A list of possible popularity modifiers
for each party,
2. The number of popularity modifiers

publishing the results of the poll.

State Cards and Tiles

Contribution Cards

Each State Card and Tile shows
a map of Germany and the
location of the state within
Germany.
The State Cards
show the relationship between
votes and seats won in each
state. The left column shows
the number of votes
a party
received in that state and the right column shows the corresponding
number of seats
won as a result.

These cards show how much money a party may receive by means of
contributions from outside sponsors. Each card has;
1. The amount of the contribution,
potential
loss
in
party
2. The
membership as a result of accepting
the contribution, and
potential
gain
in
party
3. The
membership as a result of declining
the contribution.

The State Tile only shows the maximum
number of seats a party can get in a state. It
is used for quick reference on the State
Boards to help a player decide how much that
state is truly worth in the overall campaign.

5.2.1.

The State Boards
Each player should put one of their Party Markers
on:
the 0 space of the Popularity Scale of their
colour and
the 0 space of the Vote Scale.

Each player should put one of their Meeting
Markers
on:
a Meeting Marker Space of their colour.

5.2.1.1 State Cards and Tiles

This board is now the current election state. The remaining boards,
traveling clockwise, will then get;

Shuffle the 16 State Cards and place one next to each of the State
Boards in the indicated spot. The remaining 12 cards are placed face
down on the Organization Board. The matching State Tile is then
placed on the State Tile space and the remaining State Tiles are
placed on the Organization Board.

2nd board: 3 Public Opinion Cards face up and 1 Public Opinion
Card face down.
3rd board: 2 Public Opinion Cards face up and 2 Public Opinion
Cards face down.

5.2.1.2 Public Opinion Cards

4th board: 1 Public Opinion Card face up and 3 Public Opinion
Cards face down.

Choose one of the State Boards with a Party Membership Pay Out
Tile space on it to be the first electoral state. Deal four Public
Opinion Cards, face up, onto each of the spaces provided. If any of
the cards have identical or contradictory opinions, place the most
recently dealt card on the bottom of the deck and continue dealing
until there are four face up cards, all pertaining to different issues.

The 4th board is now the last state in line for elections. In all cases,
any identical or contradictory face-up cards are dealt with in the
same way as the first board. The remaining Public Opinion Cards are
shuffled and placed face down on the Holding Space for Public
Opinion Cards on the Organization Board.
5.2.1.3 Party Membership Payout Tiles
Place the Round 1 Party Membership Payout Tile in the appropriate
spot on the 1st board and the Round 3 Party Membership Payout Tile
on the 3rd board.
Note: the above illustrated State Board example shows the set-up
for the 3rd board in line for elections.

Cards and all the Opinion Poll Cards, face down, on their appropriate
spaces on the Organization Board.
Place the remaining State Tiles, Key Issue Tiles, No-Coalition Tile and
Round 5 Party Membership Payout Tile on their appropriate spaces on
the Organization Board.
Lastly, deal 6 Public Opinion Cards from the top of the pile, face up
along the bottom of the Organization Board. In this situation,
duplicate and identical cards are allowed within the Exchange Pool
and are simply placed on top of each other but slightly offset so all
cards can be seen. These cards are referred to as the exchange
pool.

6. Course of Play
» The real rules start here. The game starts with a first round and then progresses over 7 rounds. Aside from the first round which

has the preliminary phase, rounds 1 through 6 follow these phases;
6.2 The Election Round
6.3 Score the Current State / Collect Money
6.4 End of the Round
Round 7 will only consist of Phase 6.3 Score the Current State. «

6.1 The Preliminary Phase
» The preliminary phase serves as a chance for players to set themselves up on the State Boards prior to actually starting the game.

The players have the opportunity to see the available seats in each state and the public’s opinion towards certain issues. This will help
players prepare for states where victory could be more difficult to achieve. «
In the first column, the player has chosen to increase Party
Popularity by one and gain votes in Bayern. The player would then
move their Party Marker up one on the Party Popularity Scale and
place their Party Marker on the “6” of the Vote Track on the Bayern
board. The player also chose to gain Party Meeting Markers in
Hessen. The player places 6 of their Party Meeting Markers on the
spaces provided on the Hessen board.

The players each take their scoring card and secretly write down
their starting positions on the front. The pad shows two separate
columns with 3 and 4 checkboxes in each respectively. Each player
chooses ONE option from each column. The options for each column
are as follows;
Column 1;
¾ Increase Party Popularity by one,
¾ Gain Party Meeting Markers,
¾ Gain votes.
Column 2;
¾ Gain Media Markers, and
¾ Increase Party Membership

In the second column, the player has chosen to gain Media Markers in
Berlin. The player places 2 of their Media Markers on the spaces
provided on the Berlin board. Lastly, the player chose to start the
game with increased Party Membership. The player moves their
Party Marker to the “9” place on the Party Membership Track.

In each of the above cases except for “Increase Party Membership”,
the player must write down the state in which they wish to get the
selected option and the player may choose the same state multiple
times.

All actions during the preliminary phase are free.
It is possible, after the preliminary phase, to have more Media
Markers in a state than the 5 that are allowed. In this case, the
Media markers are simply stacked and count towards determining
who has media control in phase 6.2.5. No more media markers may be
purchased during that phase but they may be replaced by Shadow
Cabinet actions in phase 6.2.3.

Example;

6.2 The Election Campaign
6.2.1

Bid for Starting Player

6.2.3

Shadow Cabinet

The Shadow Cabinet supports the player during the election
campaigns. With the aid of their Shadow Cabinet members, they
can carry out certain actions in the states, which may drastically
improve their chances of winning. «

In every round, each player secretly writes down an amount of money
on their score sheet for the current round as their bid.

»

The possibilities given by each Shadow Cabinet Card are different.
There are some strong cards which offer a larger choice of actions
and some weaker cards which are more restricted.
These
differences are reflected by the price attached to each card and the
possible actions that are listed. Some of the cards, however, also
have a telephone symbol appearing in the top right corner of the
picture on the card. These cards enable a player to form coalitions in
the region where they are played (see 6.2.4 below).
Possible Actions of a Shadow Cabinet Card:
This selection allows a player to move their Party Marker up
the Vote Scale in the selected state by the amount
indicated.

The player who bids the highest amount of money pays that amount
to the bank and may choose which player is the starting player for
the round. The chosen player then places their player token on the
“Start Player” space on the Organization Board. In the case of two
players bidding the same amount of money, those players secretly
write down another amount of money that is AT LEAST as much as
their previous bid. Then, if there is still a tie, each player simply
rolls a die and the highest roll pays their last bid to the bank and
then chooses a starting player as normal.

This selection allows a player to designate one issue in the
selected state as a key issue in the election OR reduce a
previously designated key issue back to a normal issue. The
player who played the card should either choose a Key Issue Tile
from the pile on the Organization Board and place it on one of the
face up Public Opinion Cards in that state or remove a Key Issue Tile
already in that state. The purpose of this tile when it is on a Public
Opinion Card is to double the importance of this issue when
converting Meeting Markers into votes (see 6.2.8). Only one Key
Issue Tile may be in effect in a state at any time and an issue with a
Key Issue Tile on it cannot be removed until it is reduced to a normal
issue.

If all players bid zero then each player simply rolls a die and the
highest roll chooses a starting player. In some phases of the game, it
is an advantage to start and in others, the last player to play has the
advantage. A player may bid zero to save money, or if they do not
care who goes first.
6.2.2

This selection allows a party to strengthen their influence
with the media AND weaken another party’s. The player
using this action must first remove one Media Marker
belonging to another player from the board, return it to that player,
and pay that player €4,000 for the privilege. The player then places
one of their own Media Markers in place of the old one, paying
€4,000 to the bank.

Party Platform Conference

» The conference gives each player the chance to change their
party’s platform. «
Each player has five Party Policy Cards face up in front of them
which show the party’s current political platform. Each player also
has three Party Policy Cards face down in front of them. This phase
represents discussions within the party as to what policies they
should change within their platform. The starting player goes first
and the remaining players follow in clockwise order.

This selection allows a player to improve the public’s
opinion towards their party. The player moves their Party
Marker up the Popularity Scale in the selected state by
the amount indicated. Note that a party’s popularity may NEVER be
greater than +3.

The player picks up their face down cards and looks at them. If the
player has less than three cards in hand, they draw cards to bring
their hand back up to three. The player may discard as many of
these cards as desired, placing them on the Discard Pile on the
Organization Board and then draws that many from the top of the
Party Policy Cards deck. Now, the player may remove one card from
their Party Platform to the discard pile and replace it with one of the
Party Policy Cards in their hand, face up. Only one policy per player
may be changed in a round.

This selection allows a player to decrease the public’s opinion towards
another party. The player moves another party’s Party Marker down
the Popularity Scale in the selected state by the amount indicated.
Note that a party’s popularity may NEVER be less than -3. Control of
the media does not protect a player against this action.
The starting player may choose one or more of their Shadow Cabinet
cards and place them face down next to the State Board to which
they want to apply it. A player may only place one card in each state

14

per round. Once the starting player has placed all the desired cards,
the other players follow in clockwise order. Once all players have had
a chance to play Shadow Cabinet cards, they are turned face up and
each player pays the corresponding amount to the bank. Then, in
player order, each player carries out ONE of the actions listed on all
the Shadow Cabinet Cards they played. If a player has played a card
with a telephone on it, they should now place one of their Coalition
Tiles in the appropriate space on the corresponding State Board
where the Shadow Cabinet Card was played. All Shadow Cabinet
Cards are removed from the game once used and returned to the box.
For this reason it is important you use Shadow Cabinet Cards
effectively.

in the Exchange Pool on the Organization Board that is neither
identical nor contradictory to any face-up cards already on that
State Board as explained in 5.2.1.2. Specifically, this means to take
the undesired Public Opinion Card from the State Board and place it
in the Exchange Pool. Then, take the desired Public Opinion Card
from the Exchange Pool and place it in the empty space on the State
Board. In this situation, as in 5.2.3 above, duplicate and identical
cards are allowed within the Exchange Pool and are simply placed on
top of each other but slightly offset so all cards can be seen. There
will only ever be six cards in the Exchange Pool at any time.
An additional benefit to controlling the media in a state is that the
party is protected against the negative effects of published opinion
polls as explained in 6.2.7 below.

Forming Coalitions

» Forming a coalition helps the two parties concerned in the
current election. Coalition partners add their votes together,
improving their chances of winning the election (see 6.3.2).
Coalitions may only be formed in the current electoral state. «

6.2.6

» Election meetings are the central point for all the work that a
party puts into an election.
They form the basis for the
acquisition of voters and therefore the basis of the election
result in the state. «

If there is more than one Coalition Tile on the Coalition Tile Space on
the current State Board at this point, the parties whose tiles are
there may attempt to form a coalition. A coalition only ever involves
two parties though there may be multiple coalitions. Two parties may
only form a coalition if at least two of their Party Policy Cards are
identical. Such a coalition is voluntary and requires the agreement of
both players. However, if at least three of their Party Policy Cards
are identical, either party may force a coalition upon the other party.
Beginning with the starting player and continuing clockwise, each
player may decide if they wish to force a coalition on another player.
If the player chooses to force a coalition, that player simply stacks
the two Coalition Tiles together. If a player is already involved in a
coalition, they may not enter into a second (voluntary or forced). As
a reminder of a coalition, players not involved in a coalition should now
take back their Coalition Tiles and the players involved in a coalition
should leave their Coalition Tiles stacked on the State Board.
6.2.5

Organize Party Meetings

Beginning with the starting player and continuing clockwise, players
buy and place Meeting Markers onto their corresponding spaces on
They
the four State Boards. Each Meeting Marker costs €1,000.
may only place a maximum of four Meeting Markers per state per
turn. There are only 10 Meeting Marker spaces per party per state
and once all the spaces are full, that party may not place any more
Meeting Markers in that state. A party can make space for future
turns by converting existing Meeting Markers into votes (see 6.2.8).
6.2.7

Auction Public Opinion Polls

Public Opinion Polls allow a player to improve the public’s
opinion towards their party and/or worsen the public’s opinion
towards other parties. However, the bidding on Public Opinion
Polls carries a certain amount of risk as they are auctioned off
prior to knowing the results. One Public Opinion Poll is auctioned
off per round per state. «
»

Buying Media Markers

» Buying Media Markers makes it possible for a party to have
some influence over the opinions of the public in a region. To
succeed in this, the party must have a plurality of Media Markers
in a state. «

Deal one Public Opinion Poll card, face down, to the appropriate space
on each State Board. Then, starting with the current electoral state,
the starting player may initiate the bidding process on the Public
Opinion Poll or pass. The initial bid may not be zero. Bidding
continues clockwise and each player must bid a higher amount than
the previous player or pass. Players who have passed may not enter
the bidding again for that state in this round. The player who makes
the highest bid pays that amount of money to the bank and takes the
Public Opinion Poll for that state, looks at it and decides whether to
publish the results or not. If all players pass, the opinion poll is
discarded face down with no effect, and without being revealed.

Beginning with the starting player and continuing clockwise, players
may buy a Media Marker and place it on the state board of their
choice. Each Media Marker costs the player €4,000. If they do not
wish to buy a Media Marker, they may pass. This does not prevent
them from buying and placing a Media Marker later during this phase.
Play continues in this way until all the players have passed
successively. This means that one player may continue to buy and
place Media Markers even if all the other players have passed.

Publish Public Opinion Poll:
If a player decides to publish the results of a Public Opinion Poll,
they may carry out UP TO two of the results of the poll. The party
simply moves the Party Markers for the affected party either up or
down the Popularity Scale by the amount indicated on the poll.
However, if a party has a plurality of Media Markers in a region, it is
immune to any negative effects of an opinion poll.

Media Markers may only be placed on an empty space on a State
Board and there are only five spaces on each board. Once all five are
full, no further Media Markers may be placed in that state. Once all
players have passed, players should check whether any player has a
plurality of markers in any region. This means that a player need only
have more Media Markers in a state than any other player. Starting
with the last state in line for elections and proceeding counterclockwise, if a player has control of the media in a state, they may
EXCHANGE one FACE-UP Public Opinion Card in that state with one

Do Not Publish Public Opinion Poll:

15

Markers into votes. A player may only convert Meeting Markers into
votes if they have at least 5 Meeting Markers in a state. The
starting player is the first to decide in each region whether they
want to convert and the other players follow in clockwise order.
When the players arrive at the current electoral state, there is no
reason to convert the Meeting Markers into votes since this state
will be scored later in the round (see 6.3.1).

If a party decides not to publish the results of a Public Opinion Poll,
it gets to roll two dice and moves its Party Marker up the Party
Membership Track by an amount equal to the TOTAL of the two dice
added together.

The number of votes gained per marker is not always the same. The
number is dependent upon the party's Factor, which is a combination
of the party's current Popularity Rating and its Coincidence Rating.
To calculate Factor, players simply add their party's Popularity
Rating to their Coincidence Rating. Players then use the Factor to
calculate votes as follows;

Publish: adjust either one or two
party’s trends an amount indicated on
the top half of the card.
Do Not Publish:
gain party
membership in an amount equal to the
total of two dice.

Votes = Meeting Markers x Factor
A player need not convert all their markers in a state at this point
but instead, convert only a portion of them to keep some available for
a later round.

In both cases, the Public Opinion Card is placed on the Public Opinion
Card discard pile on the Organization Board FACE DOWN to ensure
that unpublished opinion polls remain unseen by other players. The
bidding then proceeds to the next electoral state until all four Public
Opinion Poll cards have been auctioned off this turn. When there are
no more Public Opinion Cards in the draw pile, simply shuffle the
discard pile to make a new draw pile.
6.2.8

The Popularity Rating is given by the position of the player’s Party
Marker on the Popularity Scale in that state and can range from +3 to
-3.
The Coincidence Rating is determined by the number of Party Policy
Cards that are in agreement with the Public Opinion Cards in that
state. For every Policy Card that is in agreement with the Public
Opinion, the party earns a +1 to Coincidence Rating (+2 if the Public
Opinion is a key issue) and for each Policy Card that is in
disagreement with the Public Opinion, the party earns a -1 to
Coincidence Rating (-2 if the Public Opinion is a key issue). If there
are Party Policy Cards whose issues are not reflected in the Public
Opinion, those cards are worth 0 to the Coincidence Rating.

Converting Meeting Markers into Votes

» This is the central point of the game. The players have the
opportunity to convert the work that they have done towards the
election into real votes. The players must determine whether it
is better to convert their votes now, or if waiting would be a
better idea. «
In each state in turn, starting with the 4th region and moving
counterclockwise, the players may decide to convert their Meeting

Public Opinion Cards

Party Platform

In the above example, the coincidence rating would be +1 and the party’s popularity is at +2. The Factor is +3. The party has 8 Meeting
Markers in this state so the total votes gained (assuming the player wishes to convert all Meeting Markers) are;

+3 x 8 = 24 Votes
16

A player will always receive a minimum of 1 vote for every 2 Meeting
Markers (Factor = 0.5) regardless of how low their Factor actually is.
Even if 4 of a player’s Party Policy Cards are in complete
disagreement with the 4 Public Opinion Cards (-4) and their
Popularity is at -3 on the Popularity Scale (total Factor = -7), the
player will still have a Factor of 0.5 with which to convert votes with.
In this case, a player can only earn 1 vote for each FULL multiple of
two Meeting Markers as it is not possible to earn a half vote.

player has more votes than all other parties COMBINED in the state,
they may EXCHANGE one FACE-UP Public Opinion Card in that state
with one in the Exchange Pool on the Organization Board that is
neither identical nor contradictory to any face-up cards already on
that State Board as explained in 5.2.1.2. This means take the
undesired Public Opinion Card from the State Board and place it in
the Exchange Pool. Then, take the desired Public Opinion Card from
the Exchange Pool and place it in the empty space on the State
Board. In this situation, as in 5.2.3 above, duplicate and identical
cards are allowed on the Exchange Pool and simply placed on top of
each other but slightly offset so all cards can be seen. There will
only ever be six cards in the Exchange Pool at any time.

If a party gets 50 or more votes, their Party Marker is left on the
50 space on the Vote Scale. Any votes over 50 are not counted. If a
later player also earns a total of 50 or more votes, their Party
Marker is placed on top of the first one and the players stay in that
order when the state is finally scored. The last player to reach the
50 space is the leading party in the election. Markers which have
been converted are returned to the player and may be used in later
rounds. Immediately following marker conversion in each state, if a

It will be won by the party or coalition that gets the most votes

Single Party Victory
If a single party wins the election by a number of votes (rather than
“by a nose”), they may place one Media Marker on the National Board.
They may only do this, however, if they have at least one Media
Marker on the current State Board. The marker is placed in the row
of spaces at the top of the National Board corresponding to the
current round. They may also take two Public Opinion Cards from the
current state and place them in the National Opinion spaces on the
bottom of the National Board. They must place the cards in the first
free spaces, starting from the left of the board. There are two
conditions in which a player may place a card on a space which already
has a card on it when there are still open spaces available;
1.
The player may wish to “secure” a card
which is already a National Opinion,
making it more difficult to remove
from the National Opinion board. To
do this, the player places a Public
Opinion card from the current state
on top of an identical existing card.
This secured National Opinion Card
can
only
be
removed
by
a
contradictory Public Opinion Card.

«

6.3.1

Determine Seats

Beginning with the starting player and proceeding in clockwise order,
players convert all
their
remaining
Meeting Markers in
the current state into
votes as described in
6.2.8. Then, using the
State Card on the
board, every player
converts the number
of votes that they
have into seats. The
number of seats should be noted on the back of the player’s score
card in the party’s column beside the round in which it was scored.
6.3.2

Decide Election Winner in Current Election

The victor in the current election is decided by the number of votes
that the parties have earned. The party with the most votes wins.
If more than one party has the same number of votes, then the last
party to get to that number of votes is said to have won “by a nose”.
If two parties have formed a coalition, the votes for BOTH parties
are added together. The coalition wins if it has more combined votes
than any single party or other coalition. Totals of more than 50 are
allowed for coalitions. If a coalition has the same number of votes as
another coalition, the coalition with the highest Party Marker on the
Vote Track wins. If there are two or more Party Markers tied for
the highest on the Vote Track, then the party or coalition whose
Party Marker is on top wins “by a nose”.
6.3.3

2.

The player may wish to remove an existing National Opinion.
To do this, the player places a Public Opinion card from the
current state on top of a contradictory existing card, even
if it is secured. The previous National Opinion card(s) is
discarded.

In either of the above cases, there can never be two identical or
contradictory opinions on the National Board.
When all 5 National Opinion spaces are full, the player may replace
one of the old cards (provided it is not secured) with a Public Opinion
Card from the current state. If the card is secured, it can only be
replaced by its opposite Opinion Card.

If a party wins the election “by a nose”, they may still place 1 Media

take one Public Opinion Card from the current state and place it in
the National Opinion spaces as explained above.

In the example below, one of the player’s Policy Cards matches a
National Opinion Card. The player would move their Party Marker up
the Party Membership track by two.

The party that was beaten “by a nose”, may also place a Media
Marker on the National Board as explained above, but do not have the
opportunity to place a National Opinion card.
Victory by a Coalition
If a coalition wins an election, either by a number of votes or “by a
nose”, then both parties in the winning coalition may place one Media
Marker on the National Board if they had one in that state. Each
party may also place one Public Opinion Card from the current state
on the National Board as explained above starting with the player
that gained the greater number of votes. If both parties in the
coalition had the same number of votes, then the player whose Party
Marker is on top gets to place first. The coalition or party that lost
“by a nose” receives no benefits.
6.3.4

6.3.5

Pay Out Election Money

» The parties now get money, which they urgently need to help
them win future election rounds. There are two separate pay
outs, one based on the seats gained in the current election and
one based on Party Membership. «

Increase Party Membership

The parties may now increase their party membership
»
depending on how many of their Party Policy Cards coincide with
the National Opinion Cards. «

Seats Gained
The player receives €1,000 for each seat gained in the current
election, i.e. if they won 12 seats, they receive €12,000.

All players now check if any of their Party Policy Cards match any of
the National Opinion Cards. For each matching card, the party moves
its Party Marker up the Party Membership Track by an amount
indicated above the matching National Opinion Card.
Secured
opinions are simply treated as if they were normal opinions in this
case.

Party Membership Payout (Rounds 1, 3 and 5 ONLY)
The players receive €1,000 for each party member. For example, if
their Party Marker is currently on the 10 space of the Party
Membership Track, they receive €10,000. This money is only paid at
the end of rounds 1, 3 and 5.

6.4 End of the Round
» At the end of each round, the players will set up for the next
election round and consider accepting contributions. «
6.4.1

End of Round 1
After the current State has been cleared and set-up for round 2,
place the Round 5 Party Membership Pay Out tile on the appropriate
space of the State Board.

Set-up for Next Round

At the end of each round, the parties must change a few things in
preparation for the next round.
1.
The current State Board is cleared of all cards, which are
placed in the discard pile on the Organization Board. All
markers are returned to their starting positions as in 5.2.1.
2. Draw the top State Card from the pile on the Organization
Board and place it on the appropriate space on the recently
cleared State Board. Find the corresponding State Tile
from the pile and place it on the State Tile space.
3. Deal four new Public Opinion Cards onto the board, one
face-up and three face-down.
4. Each of the other three State Boards now has one more
Public Opinion Card turned face up. If, as a result of this,
any of the cards have identical or contradictory opinions (ª
and © or : and ; for the same issue), place the most

End of Round 3
Set-up for round four is the same except that when dealing the new
Public Opinion Cards onto the board, deal two face-up and two facedown. Place the No Coalition Tile on the Coalition Tile space of the
State Board. This is to remind players that no coalitions may be
formed in the 7th and final round of the game.
End of Rounds 4, 5 and 6
After the current State has been cleared, remove the State Board
and return it to the box as it will no longer be used. Continue with
step 4 as in phase 6.4.1 for each of the next State Boards.

This round is very short. Immediately after Round 6, proceed to

recently turned over card on the bottom of the deck and
deal a new one from the Public Opinion Card pile. Continue
dealing until each face up card pertains to a different issue.
This newly set-up board is now the last state in line for
elections and the board with four face-up Public Opinion
Cards is now the current state.

6.4.2

Party Contributions

» The cash gained from seats and party membership is often not
enough to finance a party’s plans. The players may, therefore,
decide to accept an outside contribution. «
Beginning with the starting player, each player in turn chooses one of
their Contribution Cards and places it in front of them. If they

6.4.1.1 Special Set-ups

18

intend to accept the contribution, the card is played face-up and if
they intend to refuse the contribution, the card is played face-down.
Parties who have played their cards face-up take the amount of
money shown on the card from the bank. Taking the money, however,
carries the risk of losing party members. Upon accepting the
contribution, the player must roll the amount of dice shown below the
contribution amount on the card. The player then moves their Party
Marker down the Party Membership Track an amount equal to the
LARGEST SINGLE NUMBER showing on the dice.

the amount of dice shown below the declined contribution amount on
the card. The player then moves their Party Marker up the Party
Membership Track an amount equal to the TOTAL amount shown on
the dice.
In addition, the player who declined the largest
contribution gets an extra bonus and may roll three more dice. The
player then moves their Party Marker up the Party Membership
Track an amount equal to the TOTAL amount shown on the dice. This
increase in Party Membership is in addition to the increase the party
received by declining the contribution. If two or more players each
decline the same highest contribution, neither gets this bonus. Used
Party Contribution Cards are returned to the box and can no longer
be used for the rest of the game.

Once all the players who placed cards face-up have played, the
players with face-down cards turn them over. By declining the
contribution, the party increases in membership. The player must roll

7.4 Coincidence Between Party Platform and
National Opinion

Players should enter the total number of seats won over the 7 state
elections in this row.

Players receive victory points for each National Opinion Card that
coincides with their Party Policy Cards.
The points for each
coincidence are given in the silver stars below the National Opinion
Cards on the National Board. In addition, there is a row for bonus
points gained for coincidence between Party Policy Cards and secured
National Opinion Cards. The player gets 5 bonus points for each
Party Policy Card that coincides with a secured National Opinion Card.

7.2 Media
Players should enter the sum of the points gained for any Media
Markers they have on the National Board. The points for each Media
Marker are given in the silver stars. In general, Media Markers
placed in later rounds score less than markers placed in earlier
rounds.

Players now sum all of their points and enter the total in the last row.
The player with the highest total wins the game.

7.3 Party Membership
Players enter their total Party Membership as shown on the National
Board at the end of round 7. In addition, the player with the highest
total Party Membership gets a bonus 10 points and the player with
the second highest total Party Membership gets a bonus 6 points. If
two or more players are tied for the highest total Party Membership,
the 16 points is divided evenly (rounded down) amongst all the tied
players and every other player gets nothing. If two or more players
are tied for the second highest total Party Membership, they all
receive nothing.

9. Tips for Playing Die Macher
» There is no strategy for this game that will ensure victory, but here are a few tips to help you achieve a high number of Victory
Points. «
Don’t try to win the game on your own. Coalitions are very useful,
especially in catching a player who has taken an early lead. Always
keep an eye on your Party Platform, and that of other parties, so that
you can form coalitions with them. Don’t let political scruples stop
you from making a good deal.

The game is characterized by a lack of everything. Players always
have either too little cash or Media Markers or Meeting Markers. Be
careful when playing to keep some resources back as a reserve,
rather than using it all up at the start of the game.
Don’t let your fellow parties know how much cash you have.

Don’t try to win every state election. The limited number of markers
makes that impossible, even if you have enough money. Let some
states go in order to focus on others. Look to see how many total
seats are up for election in each state as smaller states offer less
seats and may not be worth spending too many resources on.

The game has some elements of negotiation, which require discussion
with other players. Negotiations bring interaction into the game, and
heighten its dramatic elements, however, no agreements made during
the game are binding. It is the player’s responsibility to decide how
much they should trust the other players and to ensure that any
treachery is suitably rewarded.

The last (7th) state is especially important. Quite often, the winner
of the game doesn’t emerge until this election. You should pay special
attention when planning for this election.
