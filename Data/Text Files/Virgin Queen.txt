Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

1. INTRODUCTION

Virgin Queen is a game for two to six players based on the military,
political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of
Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls
one or more major powers that dominated Europe at the time. The
major powers represented are the Ottoman Empire (shortened in
these rules to “Ottoman”), Spain, England, France, the Holy Roman
Empire (shortened to “Holy Roman”) and the Protestant (representing both Huguenot and Dutch factions).

2. GAME MAP

The game is played on a 22” x 34” map that depicts the areas of the
world critical to European rulers in the late 16th Century. The main
playing area represents Europe and is referred to as the “Europe
Map” in these rules. Cities and towns that played an important role
in the history of Europe during this period are represented on the
Europe map as square, circular, and eight-pointed symbols called
“spaces.” A network of lines called “connections” link these spaces.
A space connected to another by one of these lines is an “adjacent”
space. Some of the spaces are also ports (a circular symbol with an
anchor inside). Ports allow access to a series of areas called “sea
zones” (blue regions with dotted blue boundaries).
On the left and bottom of the map is the peripheral play area called
the “World Map.” Significant colonial port towns are depicted on the
World Map with triangular symbols called “settlements.” Although
no land connections exist between settlements, each settlement is
considered to be connected to the “ocean zone” that it borders.
Units may never move directly from the World Map to the Europe
Map (or vice versa.)
The political and religious status of each space is updated throughout play using control markers. Detailed information about control
markers and Europe and World map elements is provided in this
section of the rulebook.

2.1 Space

All spaces on the Europe Map are either fortified or unfortified.
Fortified Space: A fortified space represents a walled city (or
town). A power must successfully besiege a fortified space to gain
political control of that city. Up to four friendly land units may
remain within a fortified space to defend that city against an enemy
siege. Fortified spaces also serve as winter quarters. There are two
different types of fortified spaces:
•	 Key: A key is a fortified space represented by a square. Keys
are the most influential and wealthy spaces; control of a key
gives a power victory points and cards. Keys with a doublesquare border are capitals. The Spanish power has two capitals
(Madrid and Milan). The Holy Roman starts with their capital
at Vienna but it switches to Prague mid-game. The Protestant
power has no fixed capital (but may create a capital in France
and one in the Netherlands when undertaking a Rebellion action in one of those areas). The other three powers each have
a single capital (Istanbul, London, Paris).

•	 Fortress: A fortress is a fortified space represented by a circle
with eight points. Fortresses are walled towns with little
economic value. They never grant a power additional victory
points or cards. However, a fortress’s strong defenses force a
power to besiege the space to gain political control. Players
may construct a fortress on an unfortified space during the game
(and Spain may construct them in World Map settlements).
Unfortified Space: A circle represents an unfortified space. These
spaces represent cities (or towns) that could be controlled without
a siege. Forces from two powers that are at war must fight a field
battle if they ever simultaneously occupy the same unfortified space.
Home Space: Spaces with a gray fill color are independent and are
not aligned with any of the powers represented in the game. All
other spaces are a home space for a specific power, as indicated
in the table below. This power is referred to as the “home power”
for that space.

2.2 Political Control

The political control of each space is tracked throughout the game.
By default, each space is under the political control of its home
power. As political control changes, control markers are placed on
top of the space to indicate that the political control has changed to
a non-home power. These control markers are color-coded by power
and also include a flag used by that power during the 16th century.

Controlled Space

A space that is controlled by a major or minor power is a controlled
space. Controlled spaces for a power include:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Home spaces that have not fallen to another power.
Independent (gray) spaces seized by the power.
Home spaces of other powers seized by the power.
Home spaces of allied minor powers.

Control Terminology

Friendly: The term “friendly” refers to any game element (space,
unit, stack, formation) that is controlled by the active power or an
ally of that power.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Enemy: The term “enemy” refers to any game element that is
controlled by a power that is currently in a state of war with the
active power.
Independent: The term “independent” refers to any game element
that is not controlled by a major or minor power. Independent game
elements are never considered to be either friendly or enemy for
the purposes of any rules of play.
EXAMPLES: Independent units cannot intercept moving forces
since only enemy formations may attempt intercepts. Adjacent
independent units do not prohibit unoccupied, unfortified spaces
from being controlled, an action that is restricted by the presence
of adjacent enemy units.

2.3 Religious Influence

The dominant Christian denomination (Catholic or Protestant) of
many spaces on the Europe Map may change during play.
Religious Struggle Areas: The background of the game map is
color-coded to depict the four regions where religious influence
may change during play. Spaces surrounded by this color-coding
are considered to be inside these regions. The four religious struggle
areas are:

Religious Struggle Area	 Area Color

Netherlands	
	 orange
France	
	 dark blue
England	
	 red
Scotland	
	 light blue	
Use these areas to delineate eligible spaces for any rules or cards
that specify an event takes place “in the Netherlands,” “in France,”
“in England” or “in Scotland.”
Catholic Space: Catholic spaces are shown by either the absence of
a control marker over a solid-colored space or by a control marker
on its solid-colored side. Solid-colored spaces outside the four
religious struggle areas are Catholic for the purposes of conversion
attempts in adjacent spaces (18.5).
Protestant Space: Protestant spaces represent cities where the new
reformed beliefs are dominant. Protestant spaces are shown by either
the absence of a control marker over a space with a colored border
and white center or by a control marker with a colored border and
white center. Spaces with a colored border and white center outside
the four religious struggle areas are Protestant for the purposes of
conversion attempts in adjacent spaces (18.5).

2.4 Control Markers

Control markers are used to denote a space’s political control and
religious influence. The flag and border color of the marker indicates
the political control of the space. The interior color of the marker
indicates the religious influence. One side of the control marker is
a solid color that represents Catholic religious influence while the
flip side of the control marker has a colored border with a white
interior that represents Protestant religious influence. There are
two shapes for control markers: a square marker for keys and a
hexagonal marker for all other spaces. (Note that Huguenot control
markers are light gray, a slight difference from their white home
spaces; this color change is necessary so you can tell the two sides
of their control markers apart).

Rules Manual

Square Markers

Square control markers are used to show the status of
keys. These markers are transferred between the
power cards (Section 4) and the map when a key is
captured or lost. Note these two rules:

1. Every key on the map must contain a square control marker.
Exceptions: independent keys not currently under major power
control and keys of minor powers when they are neither allied
to a major power nor captured.
2. Every square control marker must be either on the map or on
the appropriate power card.
Following these two rules ensures that the power cards are always
kept up to date with the proper information about card draws and
victory points.

Hexagonal Markers

Hexagonal markers are used to show the status of
fortresses and unfortified spaces. These markers are
kept out of play until needed to update the political
or religious status of a space. They are never placed
on power cards. There is no limit to the number of
spaces a power can control with hexagonal control
markers; if a power uses all its markers, improvise with unused
markers from other powers.

2.5 Europe Map Elements
Split Home Spaces

19 spaces are color-coded with two home space colors: one on the
top and one on the bottom. These spaces serve as home spaces for
two different powers. The space is initially under control of the
power shown on the bottom of the space (and that power controls
the space if no control marker is present). Thus the 7 split home
spaces that are orange on top and yellow on the bottom are initially
controlled by Spain, but can serve as a Dutch home space if the
Protestant player later gains political control of that location. The
12 split home spaces that are white on top and blue on the bottom
are initially controlled by France but can serve as a Huguenot home
space as well.

Pass

A connection shown with a dashed line is a pass. There are 4 passes
across the Pyrenees between Spain and France, 6 passes in the Alps
near northern Italy, and 7 passes in the Balkans. Formations of land
units moving over a pass expend 2 command points (CP) instead
of the usual cost of 1 CP for moving over a normal connection.

Passes also:

•	 block spring deployment of land units,
•	 prevent interception by an enemy formation that is adjacent
across a pass, and
•	 inhibit land units’ ability to control adjacent spaces and remove
unrest in adjacent spaces.

Units may retreat or avoid battle over a pass.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Rules Manual
Inland Waterways

Two connections on the Europe Map are
neither normal connections nor passes.
These are the “inland waterway” connections between Brielle and Rotterdam and
between Flushing and Antwerp, each
shown with a squiggly blue line. Only a
power that controls the normal port in
these connections (Flushing or Brielle)
may use this path for movement, intercept,
avoiding battle, line of communication or computing the nearest
space. However these spaces are always assumed to be connected
for the purposes of Conversion attempts (18.0). See 16.7 for more
details on the special status of Antwerp and Rotterdam.

Sea Zones

The Europe map contains 13 sea zones, divided into two groups.
8 sea zones are Mediterranean sea zones and are labeled with
blue text:
Barbary Coast	
Tyrrhenian Sea	
Adriatic Sea	
North African Coast	

Gulf of Lyon
Ionian Sea
Aegean Sea
Eastern Mediterranean

Galleons are less effective at intercepting or avoiding battle in
Mediterranean sea zones.
The other 5 sea zones (labeled with black text) are Atlantic sea zones:
Irish Sea		North Sea
English Channel		Bay of Biscay
Atlantic Ocean

5

2.6 World Map Elements

Ocean Zones: The 10 darkest blue zones on the map are the principal feature of the World Map and are called “Ocean Zones.” The
water around the Americas is divided into eight of the Ocean Zones;
the other two are across the map and represent the Indian Ocean
and South Pacific. Expeditions led by sea captains (available to the
Ottoman, English, French, Holy Roman and Protestant powers) and
Spanish patrols are the only units that may ever occupy ocean zones.
Trade Winds: Boundaries between ocean
zones are shown by a line of white dots.
Five of these boundaries are overlaid with
a light blue arrow that shows the direction
of the trade winds in that portion of the
oceans. Expeditions traveling in the opposite direction from the arrow must survive a roll on the Navigation Table to complete that move.
Hazardous Passages: Some pairs of ocean zones
are connected by travel over particularly dangerous areas of the world for 16th Century navigators
(and a number of these connections are between
areas that are not physically adjacent on the Virgin
Queen map). Expeditions may move across one
of these hazardous passages, but they must survive a Navigation
roll regardless of the direction of travel.

3. POWERS AND RULERS

This section defines players, powers, and rulers and gives high-level
information about these game concepts.

Galleys and corsairs are less effective when fighting in Atlantic
sea zones; galleons must be constructed in a port bordering an
Atlantic sea zone.
Boundaries between sea zones are shown by a line of blue dots.
Only naval leaders and naval units may occupy sea zones; land
units must always end every action in a space.

Port

Most (but not all) of the spaces near the coast act as ports, which
provide access to one or more sea zones. One-zone ports possess
a single anchor symbol. Two-zone ports have two anchors next
to them, one anchor within each of the two sea zones that may be
accessed from that space.
The following sea zones are not connected:
•	 Ionian Sea/Tyrrhenian Sea (two-zone port: Messina)
•	 Barbary Coast/Atlantic Ocean (two-zone port: Gibraltar)
However, if the two-zone port between these zones (Messina or
Gibraltar) is controlled by your power, naval units may move into
this port from one zone during one Naval Move action and then
back out to either zone during a later Naval Move action.

3.1 Player

A player is a human participant in the Virgin Queen game. Virgin
Queen can be played with any number of players from two to six.
Regardless of the number of players, all six major powers play
roles in the game. In games with less than 6 players the Ottoman
and Holy Roman powers move between an inactive state and an
active state (where they are controlled by a specific player for a
limited amount of time).

3.2 Power

A power is a nation or city-state present in the game. The Huguenot
and Dutch rebels in France and the Netherlands respectively are
merged into a single Protestant power. There are 11 powers: 6 major and 5 minor. If the text of a rule or card says “power” without
specifying “major” or “minor,” the rule pertains to a major power.

Major Power

The major powers are England, France, the Holy Roman, the Ottoman, the Protestants, and Spain. Each major power has a “power
card” (Section 4) that tracks its status with respect to allowable
actions, card draws, victory points, and current ruler. Many game
functions are conducted one power at a time in the following order
(known as “Impulse Order”):
1. Ottoman
2. Spain
3. England
4. France
5. Holy Roman
6. Protestant

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Activated Major Power

In games with less than six players, the diplomatic status of the Ottoman and Holy Roman power is evaluated during play. The player
whose power wins this evaluation gains control over that power until
the time that their diplomatic status is once again assessed. There
are a few special restrictions (and benefits) on players controlling
such an “Activated Major Power,” making them slightly different
to play than a standard major power. See the section “Games with
2 to 5 Players” in the Scenario Book for details.

4. POWER CARDS

The status of each major power is tracked on a power card. Each
of the 6 power cards contains the following sections:
List of
Actions
Initial
Card
Ruler

Minor Power

The minor powers are Ireland, the Papacy, Portugal, Scotland and
Venice. The allegiance of these states can change during play.

Bonus
VP
Box

3.3 Ruler

The ruler of each major power plays an important role during the
game, whether monarch (Spain, England, France, Holy Roman),
sultan (Ottoman), or pool of army commanders (Protestant). The
initial ruler for each power is printed on the right side of their
power card. The rulers of three major powers (Ottoman, France,
Holy Roman) change during play as the result of Mandatory Event
cards (Section 6.1). Subsequent rulers enter play when one of these
Mandatory Events is resolved. These cards are placed over the ruler
printed on the power card so that the new ruler’s attributes are visible to all players. Philip II (Spain), Elizabeth I (England), Henry
III (France), and Rudolf II (Holy Roman) are the last leader for
these powers and are never replaced through a Mandatory Event.
However, these four rulers may be killed through a Marriage result
(21.1) or Assassination (19.3; Elizabeth and Henry only). In such
a case, that power’s ruler attributes are specified by the rules in
Section 23 covering the death of that ruler.

Attributes

All rulers possess two attributes: administrative rating and card
bonus, as described below.
Administrative Rating: The administrative (or “admin”) rating of
a ruler evaluates that ruler’s ability to conserve national resources
so they can be applied in times of need. An administrative rating
is always given in terms of the number of cards that ruler can save
from one turn to the next.
Card Bonus: The card bonus of a ruler evaluates whether or not
a ruler was exceptionally resourceful in mobilizing support for his
endeavors. A card bonus is usually given in terms of the number of
extra cards a power is dealt when led by this ruler. The one exception is Suleiman’s card bonus that:
a) allows the Ottoman player to retain both his Home cards in
his hand for that turn, and
b) gives the Ottoman the Selim II card at the start of Turn 2 if
the card is still in the deck.

Additional Ruler Functions

Henry III of France and each member of the pool of Protestant
army leaders also affect the game as army leaders. See Section 5.1.
This additional army leader function is entirely separate from these
personages’ role as ruler of a major power.

Rules Manual

• 	List of Actions (upper-left): A list of each possible action that
this power can undertake during the Action Phase (Section
11), including the actions’ CP cost. The list of possible actions
differs by power. The background color of each item in the list
denotes the type of that action.
• 	Initial Ruler Card (upper-right): Attributes of the initial ruler
for this power, as described in Section 3.3.
• 	Bonus VP Box (lower-right): This is a holding area for markers
that show the player has been awarded Victory Points for one
of more of the results included in the Bonus VP list in Section
25.
The power card also contains customized information in the lower
left. Although the format of this section differs for each power, this
section always shows how to determine the number of card draws
for that power (before card bonuses are added) and the number of
base VP (before special and bonus VP are added). For some powers
this area also includes one or more special power-specific tracks or
boxes, described in more detail in Sections 10, 20.6, 21.1 and 23.

5. MILITARY UNITS

There are four types of military units: leaders, sea captains, land
units, and naval units. This section shows an example of each military unit and explains the importance of any numeric values on the
counter. The pieces provided are an absolute limit. No more may
be created for any purpose; the number provided is indicative of
the overall manpower and financial resources of each power during
this period. Military units use the same color as the home spaces for
each power (Exceptions: Huguenot military units are light gray to
match their control markers; Independent military units are brown,
unlike their gray spaces on the map).

5.1 Leaders

Leaders are placed in plastic stands so players can quickly determine their current location on the map. (Flat leader counters are
also provided for those who prefer this alternative.) The numeric
information contained on the leader counter differs slightly for army
and naval leaders. Naval leaders have a blue background for their
counters that distinguishes them from army leaders.

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Army Leader

Battle Rating: The top number on army leaders is
their battle rating. Higher battle ratings increase the
chance of successfully intercepting or avoiding battle,
and add extra dice during assault and field battle.

Command Rating: The bottom number (always appearing in a
yellow box) is the leader’s command rating. This number indicates
the number of land units the leader can control at one time.
Default Leaders: Army Leaders may be removed
from play by the Untimely Death event, assassination
(19.3), or by the “Husband murdered” marriage result
(21.1). If one of these results causes the last leader of
a power to be removed from play, place the square
counter for this leader on its back (Default Leader) side and place
it on the Turn Track. This unnamed leader will enter play in a future
turn if that power has no newly arriving leader. For the purpose of
this rule, captured leaders are “in play,” while leaders that do not
enter until a future turn are “out of play.” Huguenot leaders are
considered to be from a separate power than the Dutch leaders.

Formations

A formation is a group of land units in a single space that functions
as a combined entity for the purposes of movement, field battle, intercept, and assault. One or more army leaders may also be included
in the formation. The maximum number of land units in a formation is dependent on the Command Rating of any leaders present:
	 Leaders Present 	
	
none	
	
1	
	
2 or more	

Maximum Formation Size

4
Command Rating of leader
Sum of highest two command ratings

Army leaders are never counted when determining the size of a
formation. Formations may not include units from two different
major powers. They may include units of a major power and a
minor power which is actively allied to that major power.
FORMATION EXAMPLE: The Holy Roman leaders Schwendi
(command rating 8) and Zrinyi (command rating 6) are stacked in
Vienna with 6 regulars and 8 mercenaries. The Holy Roman spends
1 CP to move a formation to Pressburg. If the Holy Roman includes
neither leader with the formation, just 4 land units may move. If
the Holy Roman includes only 1 leader, the number of regulars and
mercenaries must be equal to or less than the command rating of
that leader. The Holy Roman player would have to move both leaders from the space in order to move all 14 land units from Vienna.

7

5.2 Sea Captains

Sea captains are historical explorers and
pirates that sail across the World Map to
attempt piracy, establish colonies, and
attempt to circumnavigate the globe.
They are added to the New World map
with the Build Expedition action (17.4). Sea captains from England
(only) are also allowed to instead serve as naval leaders on the
Europe map. Sea captains are always depicted with a two-sided flat
counter. The front of the counter (the “Full Strength” side) is much
the same as a naval leader with the sea captain’s battle rating as the
large number in the top left and a piracy rating in the middle of the
left side of the counter. The sea captains de Sores and le Clerc are
available to either the French or Protestant player: whoever first
builds an expedition with one of these counters has exclusive use
of that captain until he returns to Europe (when he once again
becomes available to the first player that recruits him).
Navigation Rating: Sea captains possess a third numeric value
listed after their piracy rating. This number (after the “N”) is their
navigation rating, a die roll modifier used to help them survive
treacherous voyages on the World Map.
Damaged: The back of a sea captain counter is the “Damaged”
side. Sea captains are flipped to this side if they take losses while
undergoing a Navigation roll or while initiating piracy. The text
on the damaged side briefly describes that captain’s special bonus.
(See the Scenario Book for a complete explanation). This bonus is
available to that captain at all times, whether or not he is damaged
or at full strength.

5.3 Land Units

There are three types of land units, all represented with circular
pieces. Land unit pieces come in different “denominations” (1, 2, 4,
and 6) to facilitate stacking. Not all denominations are available for
every power. Players may free up small denomination units at any
time by replacing several pieces (all of the same type and all in the
same space) with a stronger piece of equal total strength. If, after
freeing up small denomination units wherever possible across the
board, a power still has an insufficient number of small denomination units to properly “make change” to satisfy a Combat or Event
card result, that power loses additional units from the space where
the combat or event is occurring until a number is reached that can
be represented with the available counters.

Naval Leader

Battle Rating: The top number on naval leaders is
their battle rating. Higher battle ratings increase the
chance of successfully intercepting or avoiding battle,
and add extra dice during naval combat.

Piracy Rating: The Ottoman naval leaders Dragut and Uluch Ali
possess a second numeric value. This number (after the “P”) is their
piracy rating, indicating the number of extra dice the leader provides
when present in a sea zone where the Ottoman is initiating piracy.

The four denominations of Spanish regulars

Regulars: Regulars have a multi-colored unit symbol and a solid
stripe across the bottom of the counter in their power’s color. The
numeric value on the counter shows the number of regulars represented by this game piece. All powers, both major and minor,
have regulars.

Mercenaries: Mercenaries have a solid black unit
symbol. The background is a pale version of their
power’s color. The numeric value on the counter
shows the number of mercenaries represented by
this game piece. All major powers except the Otto-

man receive mercenaries. Mercenary units can be found on the
reverse side of regulars for these powers. Mercenaries are cheaper
to construct than regulars, but may desert a player at a key moment.

Patrol: Patrols can be constructed by Spain in an ocean
zone. They help protect World Map settlements from
piracy.

Cavalry: Only the Ottoman player possesses cavalry units. The numeric value on the counter shows
the number of cavalry units represented. Cavalry
units can be found on the reverse side of Ottoman
regulars. Cavalry aid in intercept and avoid battle
attempts, but are ineffective during siege operations.

Spanish Armada: One special naval unit,
the “Spanish Armada” is available only to
Spain. See Section 23.2.

5.4 Naval Units

Rectangular pieces are used to represent naval units. Each naval
unit always represents a single group of naval vessels. There are
no denominations of naval units. The numeric value on the counter
shows the number of dice it rolls in naval combat and the number
of enemy hits required to eliminate it. The color around the number
shows which power owns the unit. As shown in the table below,
seven powers receive naval units. Four of these powers support two
different types of naval units; the type of a unit in play is depicted
by which side of the counter is face up. Powers with two-sided
units should carefully consider the unique properties of each of the
four types of naval units when deciding which units to construct.
Restrictions on naval unit construction are found in 17.3.

The game play in Virgin Queen is driven by a single deck of 112
cards supplemented by a pool of 30 treasure counters. This section
explains each of the different types of cards, and how to manage
adding and removing cards from the deck. It also describes management of the treasures, which are treated as a specialized form
of card with limited uses.

6.1 Card Types

There are five types of cards in the game, as described below. With
the exception of Mandatory Event cards, every card may be played
as either an event, or as command points (CP). CP may be used to
take actions (Section 11), or to declare war (Section 9.4). (When
playing a Mandatory Event, the event takes effect first, then the
active power receives 2 CP to spend on actions.) If a player uses a
card as an event, he or she follows the instructions printed on the
card. Some cards have alternate sets of instructions separated by
the word “OR” in capital letters. These cards give the player an
option of playing them different ways. When playing a card with
multiple sets of instructions, only the conditions and effects in the
portion of the card chosen by the player apply.

Home Cards

Galley: Galleys are less effective when
fighting in Atlantic sea zones. They are

sails.

vessel with black sails.

6. CARDS AND TREASURES

Corsair: Corsairs are the only naval unit
that may initiate piracy in Europe without
being at war with the target power. They
are less effective when fighting in Atlantic
sea zones. They are shown as a low-sided
Galleon: Galleons fight equally well across
the map but are penalized trying to intercept or avoid battle in Mediterranean sea
zones. They are shown as a high-sided
vessel with white sails.
Race-built Galleon: Race-built galleons
are equivalent to galleons except that they
take less damage when fighting in Atlantic
sea zones. They are shown as a lower
profile galleon.

Each power has one or two Home cards available for play each
turn. The exact number varies based on power and game turn as
per the rules for adding new cards to play (6.2). With the exception of the Ottoman player while Suleiman is the Ottoman ruler, all
powers must secretly discard down to just one Home Card during
the Spring Deployment Phase at the start of each turn. Once used,
Home Cards are placed on the appropriate power card (not in the
discard pile) to show that they are not available until cards are dealt
at the start of the next turn. Home Cards can never be taken from
a power’s hand when a random draw is required (either by Event
card play, diplomatic agreement, espionage or piracy) or when a
specific card is chosen (Event card play or espionage). If a power
is forced to reveal his hand he must also show any Home Cards
that he is holding.

Mandatory Event Cards

Cards with the name of the card in red and the word “Mandatory”
printed on them are Mandatory Event cards. Mandatory Events
must be played during the Action Phase of the turn in which they
are drawn. When played, the event is always resolved first, then
the playing power receives 2 command points to spend on actions.
Mandatory Events may never be held from one turn to the next.
A player may not pass during his impulse in the Action Phase if a
Mandatory Event card is still in his hand. Mandatory Events may
either be removed from play after they occur or remain in the deck
from turn to turn; check the text on each card carefully after play.

Rules Manual
Response Cards

Cards with the name of the card in blue and the word “Response”
printed on them are Response cards. Response cards are playable as
an event in the Action Phase during any player’s impulse (including
your own). Play of a Response card interrupts a player’s impulse,
a battle, or an Event card play. Players should allow a reasonable
amount of time for play of a Response card by another player after
each action, event, naval combat, or assault. Response cards can
also be played for CP during a player’s impulse if a player does
not wish to use the card’s special ability to interrupt another player.

Combat Cards

Cards with the name of the card in black and the word “Combat”
printed on them are Combat cards. Combat cards are playable as an
event only during a field battle, assault, or naval combat in which
the card owner’s units are participating. The Combat card is played
just before that battle is resolved. Combat cards can also be played
for CP during a player’s impulse if a player does not wish to use
the card’s special ability to be played during combat.

Event Cards

All other cards in the deck are Event cards. The name of these
cards appears in black, like Combat cards. These cards are played
as events during the owning player’s impulse in the Action Phase.
They may also be played for CP during a player’s impulse if a player
does not wish to use the card’s event. Two events (Gouvernante de
France, Union of Arras) have game effects that last until the end
of the current game turn. A marker is provided in the counter mix
for each of these events. When one of these two cards is played as
an event, place the appropriate marker on the current turn of the
Turn Track to remind players that this event is in effect. One Event
card has a special use as an event that can only be played during
the Negotiation Segment of the Diplomacy Phase (Louise of Lorraine). Refer to that card for specifics on its use.

Adding Cards

The upper-right hand corner of 39 cards contains a turn number or
the phrase “When Catholic League Forms.” None of these cards are
used on Turn 1. Instead, add them to play at the start of the Card
Draw Phase of the turn specified on the card (or the turn after the
Catholic League has formed). Home cards added on a specific turn
are given directly to the appropriate power; all other cards entering
play are added to the deck (before new hands are dealt).

Dealing Cards

Each power is dealt the number of cards indicated in the lower left
section of their power card. The number of cards is determined by
the number of square control markers on the board. The last uncovered square in the “Cards and VP Per Key” section shows the
number of cards dealt to that power. Squares on a power card can
also be covered by Unrest markers (Section 12.4), further reducing
the power’s card deal. If all spaces are covered, that power still
receives 1 base card.
After computing the cards from square control markers, add one
extra card if this power receives a card bonus from their ruler. Then
add and subtract cards from this power’s total as indicated by any
+1 or –1 Card markers accumulated by this power. Once the card
total has been updated, remove all +1/–1 Card markers except
those from foreign wars still in progress or from the construction
of the Suez Canal.
These newly dealt cards are combined with the power’s Home
card(s) and any unused cards from the previous turn to form the
power’s “hand” for the upcoming turn.

Discard Pile & Cards Out of Play

After a card is played, it is either removed from the game or placed
in a single discard pile shared by all players:
Out of Play: Cards are removed from the game if they are played
as an event and the text “Remove from deck if played as event”
appears on the card or if the text “Remove from deck after [some
condition]” appears and that condition has been satisfied.
Discard Pile: Cards are always placed in the discard pile if they
lack the text “Remove from deck...” Event cards with this text are
also placed in the discard pile if they are played for CP, rather than
as an event, or if the condition listed after “Remove from deck…”
is not met. One of the cards in the game (The Virgin Queen) can
be exchanged for a card selected from those currently in the discard pile. There are a few restrictions on these retrievals from the
discard pile:
•	 Mandatory Events may never be retrieved from the discard
pile, and

	

Response Card	

6.2 The Deck

•	 A power may never retrieve a card from the discard pile that
this same power played as an Event, Response or Combat
card earlier in the turn. (This second restriction also applies
to retrieval of Grand Tour and Holy League from the discard
pile by the Gouvernante de France and Papal Bull events).

Event Card

The cards available to each power each turn consist of their Home
card(s) and a variable number of cards dealt to that power from a
single deck of shared cards. The deck is reshuffled each turn, after
any new cards for that turn have been added, and before cards are
dealt to each power.

All cards in the discard pile are reincorporated back into the deck
during the Card Draw Phase at the start of each turn. These cards
are combined with (a) the cards that were not dealt during the previous turn, and (b) the new cards entering play to form the deck
for the upcoming turn.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

6.3 Treasures

A summary of the sequence of play can be found below:

Treasure counters represent riches entering Europe from World Map possessions.
At the start of the game place all treasures in a pool with the word “Treasure”
face up so the value of each treasure is
hidden from view. Treasures are drawn from this pile as needed by
rolls for colonies and by the rules below for placing Spanish and
Portuguese treasures at the start of the turn. As treasures are spent
during play, set them aside with their values revealed to form a
discard pile of treasures expended that turn. These counters are
mixed back into the treasure pool as part of the final step of the
Card Draw Phase.

Spanish and Portuguese Treasures

After returning discards to the pool of treasures, Spain draws random treasures from this pool to fill in the Spanish and Portuguese
treasure rows (located over North Africa near the bottom of the
map). Always fill 4 of the boxes with treasures for Spain; fill the 5th
box if Spain controls the Philippines settlement. These Spanish treasures may be viewed by the Spanish player at any time. They will
return to the Spanish hand during the Winter Phase if the Spanish
can fend off World Map piracy attempts (16.5). Then deal treasures
as needed to fill the 3 boxes on the row for Portugal. Portuguese
treasures cannot be viewed by any player until they are captured by
piracy or returned to the power controlling Lisbon (20.7).

Receiving Treasures

Treasures enter the Spain player’s hand when returned to Europe
by the Treasure Fleet Mandatory Event or during the Winter Phase.
Treasures enter the hands of the other five powers by successful
colony rolls and when expeditions return home with captured loot.
Once in a hand, treasures may only be viewed by the controlling
player. They are expended during an impulse in much the same
manner that cards are played as command points. See Section 11
for a complete description of how to “play” treasures. They may
also be used to pay for declarations of war (9.4).

Mixed Hand of Cards and Treasures

Events, ransom, Europe Map piracy hits, and espionage results
force a player to have a “card” drawn out of his hand at random.
If a player has a hand that consists of both cards and treasures, the
random draw could be either a card or treasure, even though the
text always refers to drawing a “card.” Whether the random choice
is a card or treasure depends on the number of each of these two
types of items in the target power’s hand:
•	 If the target has more cards than treasures, draw randomly from
the cards (ignoring the treasures)
•	 If the target has more treasures than cards, or an equal number,
draw randomly from the treasures (ignoring the cards).

7. SEQUENCE OF PLAY

Rules Manual

The game is played in seven or less turns. Each turn covers a period
of five or six years. Each turn consists of eight phases. The fourth
phase, the Action Phase, is the most time-consuming phase, for
it includes a variable number of rounds where each major power
plays one card. Each such card play is called an “impulse.” Players
use the final phase, the Victory Determination Phase, to decide if a
winner can be declared (or if another turn is required).

Rules Manual

8. CARD DRAW PHASE

11

8.2 Add Fortresses and Jesuits

The first phase is the Card Draw Phase. On each turn, players use
this phase to add new personages (leaders, sea captains, royals,
artists, and scientists); add fortresses and Jesuits (Spain only); add
new cards to the deck; deal cards and award treasures from colonies.

8.1 Add New Personages

If this is Turn 2 or later, new historical personages enter play. These
new units are army or naval leaders, sea captains, royals, artists,
and scientists. Refer to the Turn Track to find the total number
of personages of each type that should be entering play that turn.

Leaders

Refer to the Scenario Book to find which leaders
enter play during that turn’s Card Draw Phase. Uluch
Ali enters at this time as a replacement for Dragut if
he was killed by the Dragut Falls! event on the
previous turn. Default leaders replacing army leaders
eliminated during the previous turn also enter play at this time,
though only if that power does not have a newly arriving army
leader. Naval leaders eliminated from play are also brought back
at this time. Place the counter for an arriving leader on the appropriate power card; it will be added to the map during the Spring Deployment Phase this turn (Exception: Protestant army leaders have
the option to remain on the power card until a rebellion occurs). A
power can never have a default leader in play at the same time as
a standard army leader. If a default leader for a power is either in
play or on the Turn Track when a standard army leader arrives,
remove that default leader from the game.
EXCEPTION: The Duke of Guise enters during the Winter Phase
if the Catholic League is formed (20.10). He is the only leader that
does not arrive in the Card Draw Phase.

During the Card Draw Phase, Spain
places Fortress and Jesuit markers on his
power card to limit the number of such
items he may add to play in the upcoming turn. Add markers to the power card
until Spain reaches the following totals:
Fortresses: 	
Jesuits:	

1 (unless Spain has the Coastal Fortification
science bonus, then 2).
1 (unless the English College, Douai event has
been played, then 2).

Note that Spain will place fewer markers on his power card if unused
markers remain from the previous turn.

8.3 Add New Cards to Deck/Deal Cards

If this is Turn 2 or later, new cards may be added to the deck. The
deck is then shuffled and cards are dealt to each power as described
in Section 6.2.

8.4 Refresh Treasures/Check for New World Riches

Refresh the pool of treasures and draw treasures for Spain and
Portugal as described in Section 6.3 Next, powers with colonies on
the World Map may receive treasures. The power owning a colony
rolls two dice for each and consults the appropriate column of the
Colony Table. Add 1 to the roll if this power possesses the Plantation science bonus. The results on that table are explained below:
Eliminated: Colony eliminated (though it may reenter the game
with another Build Expedition action). If one or more sea captains
are wintered here, immediately move their expedition(s) to the
adjacent ocean zone.
NE: No effect. Keep this colony for another turn.
Treasure: Draw a treasure from the pool immediately and keep
this colony for another turn.
Treasure plus Virginia Dare VP: Draw a treasure from the
pool immediately, keep this colony for another turn, and award
1 Virginia Dare bonus VP to this power.

Other Personages

Other historical personages arriving during the Card Draw Phase
are placed on the proper area for their type of unit:
Sea Captains	
Royals	
Artists	
Scientists	

Force pool of available builds for their power
Royal Weddings Chart
Patronage Chart (Artists Currently Available)
Patronage Chart (Scientists Currently Available)

The turn of entry for royals, artists, and scientists is shown on the
backside of their counter. The turn of entry for sea captains is listed
in the Scenario Book.

Naval Units

Naval units eliminated in a previous turn
are also returned to each power’s pool of
units available to be constructed.

9. DIPLOMACY

The second phase of each turn is the Diplomacy Phase.

9.1 Negotiations

The first segment of the Diplomacy Phase allows players to conduct
secret negotiations away from the game board with one or more
opponents. Several such discussions can occur during the Negotiation Segment of a single turn. This portion of the turn is the only
time players may make deals in private; all other discussions must
take place in the presence of all players. Players are free to discuss
general strategic considerations during negotiations. Cards or treasures in your hand may be revealed to other players if desired. They
may also make a limited set of agreements that alter the position of
units, leaders, cards or markers in play. Such a change is considered
to be a “change in the current game state.” The only agreements
allowed that change the game state are:
•	 Two powers may agree to end a war they are fighting. End the
war by removing the “At War” marker from the appropriate box

•

•	
•	

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598
on the Diplomatic Status Display. Exception: Once they have
gone to war, Spain and England may never agree to peace.
Two powers may form an alliance for exactly one turn (Section
9.2), but not if they are currently at war and are not agreeing
to end that war (see above).
A power entering an alliance may loan naval units and naval
leaders to the other power in that same alliance for one turn
(Section 9.2).
A captured army leader may be returned. Place that army leader
in his capital if possible. If not, place him in a friendly home
key.
A power may yield political control of spaces it controls to
another major power. Any units occupying these spaces are
displaced (12.5). However this granting of a space can only
occur if one of the following conditions is true:
(a) the space is being given back to its Home power,
(b) the space is in France and is being exchanged between
France and the Protestant (either direction), or (c) the space
is in the Netherlands and is being exchanged between Spain
and the Protestant (either direction).

•	 A power may agree to give another power up to two random
card draws from their hand. Such a card must always be chosen at random; players cannot exchange specific cards. Two
players may not give each other card draws in the same turn;
such an exchange can only occur in one direction on a given
turn. (Remember that Home cards are ignored when drawing
randomly from a player’s hand.)
•	 A power may agree to give another power up to two randomly
drawn treasures from their hand (using the same rules as for
drawing cards in the previous bullet).
•	 All powers except the Ottoman may agree to give another
power up to four mercenaries. All powers except the Ottoman
and Holy Roman may receive mercenaries in such a deal. Two
players may not give each other mercenaries in the same turn;
such an exchange can only occur in one direction on a given
turn. The power granting mercenaries removes the specified
number of mercenaries from any single space or combination
of spaces. If the Holy Roman player is granting mercenaries,
he may also remove mercenaries from the Mercenaries for Hire
Track on his power card. The power receiving the mercenaries
then takes the equivalent number of mercenaries from his force
pool and adds them to his capital (or distributes them as desired
between his capitals). Each capital receiving mercenaries must
be currently on the map, free of unrest, and controlled by the
receiving power. Mercenaries for Hire not granted during
negotiations are lost; the Holy Roman player should drop the
marker to the “0” space on the track on his Power Card at the
end of the Negotiation Segment.
•	 Two powers may agree to marry a male Royal and a female
Royal (Section 21). Stack the royal cards for these two royals
near the Royal Wedding table. They are considered “betrothed”
until their marriage is evaluated during the Marriage Resolution
Phase near the end of the turn. (Exception: If Mary Queen of
Scots is the female Royal, resolve the wedding immediately).
A power may also announce that a male and female royal both
under control of his power are going to marry, though this is less
advantageous than a marriage to a royal from another power.

Rules Manual

Restrictions:

o	 Royals from two different powers may not agree to marry if
those two powers are currently at war and are not agreeing to
end that war (the powers may go to war later in the turn; if so,
the marriage is not cancelled).
o	 Two Royals from the same family (indicated by the “V” for
Valois on some French Royals or the “H” for Hapsburg on all
Spanish Royals) may never agree to marry.
o	 Mary Queen of Scots may not be part of a marriage agreement
if captured in England.
o	 No army leader may be part of an agreement if currently captured (though they may be captured during the turn without
affecting the marriage).

Players should agree to a time limit for the Negotiation Segment
before discussions begin. Suggested limits are:
• 10 minutes in face-to-face play
• 48 hours in email play
When this time limit is reached (or discussions have ended), each
power (in Impulse Order) declares any agreements it has made that
will result in a change in the game state. Announcements can be
made as individual items, or as a group of agreements that need
to be ratified together. All powers involved in an agreement that
follow later in Impulse Order must confirm all the contents of this
declaration when it is their turn in the Impulse Order. If they do
not confirm the full deal, none of the items in the agreement take
effect. If the agreement is confirmed by all parties, the players
immediately change the game state by updating diplomatic status,
marking and moving loaned naval units, returning army leaders,
changing political control of spaces, drawing random cards or
treasures, exchanging mercenaries, or stacking the cards for a royal
couple near the Royal Wedding table.

Restrictions:

o	 Each agreement included in an announcement must be possible
at the time it is declared. You may make more announcements
than can possibly be accepted (as long as each individual one
is valid.) [EXAMPLE: England has 2 mercenaries on the map.
It is valid for England to announce both a deal where France
receives those mercenaries and another deal where the Protestant receives them; in this case the first power to confirm the
deal will make it impossible for a later power to confirm the
other deal that involves those same mercenaries.]
o	 Conditional announcements (i.e., ones where you place a
caveat on whether or not an agreement goes through based on
the diplomatic actions of powers coming after you in Impulse
Order) are not permitted in any form. [EXAMPLE: England
may not announce a deal where they grant 2 mercenaries to
France if France agrees to go to peace with the Ottoman.]

Non-Binding Agreements

The only portion of an agreement that is binding between powers
is the portion that changes the current game state. Since items such
as a diplomatic action on a future turn, a promised card play, or
a coordinated movement of troops can’t be executed at this time,
they do not change the current game state and are examples of a
non-binding portion of an agreement. Non-binding agreements can
be made at any time between players but they are never announced
and there is never any repercussion within the game mechanics for
breaking them (though there might be some repercussions at your
gaming table!).

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

9.2 Alliances

Alliances are agreements between two major powers to cooperate
for one turn. Alliances must be announced to all players at the end
of the Negotiation Segment. A single power may be part of more
than one alliance in the same turn. Two or more powers each in
alliance with the same power need not be allied with each other.
The restrictions on creating an alliance and the effects of forming
one are detailed below.

Restrictions

o	 An alliance may not be created if the two powers are currently
at war.
o	 Spain and the Protestant may never become allies.
o	 France may ally with Spain or the Protestant but not with both
these powers on the same turn.

Effects

An alliance provides these benefits:
o	 Spaces controlled by either power become friendly to both
powers. This means that land units may enter spaces controlled
by their ally during movement and retreat.
Naval units (other than corsairs, patrols and the
o	
Spanish Armada) may be loaned to an ally for 1 turn.
Such a loan must be announced at the same time as
the alliance; naval units may not be loaned later in
the turn. Two players may not loan each other naval units in
the same turn; such an exchange can only occur in one direction
on a given turn. Place one of the receiving power’s “Loaned”
markers on each unit received. Then move the loaned unit to
the nearest port controlled by the receiving power, counting
each sea zone traversed as 1 space along such a path. A loaned
unit is treated just like any other naval unit of the receiving
power (it moves, fights, retreats, and intercepts as if it was one
of that power’s naval units). The naval units stacked in a single
port do not need to be loaned as a complete group. A naval
leader stacked with the on-loan units may also be loaned to the
allied power. Naval units may not be loaned unless there is a
path of sea zones connecting their current port with a port of
the receiving power. This path may not include a port space
(such as Gibraltar).
o	 If a stack of land units from two major powers is attacked, they
combine their units and army leaders into one defensive force.
Either power may retreat their units and/or leaders from the
space (with each power making a separate Avoid Battle roll).
If units from two major powers defend together, battle and assault losses are split evenly between the powers until a power
is eliminated; roll randomly to see who suffers any odd loss.
Add an “Allied” marker to the space that serves as a
cross-reference between these powers on the Diplomatic Status Display. The alliance is always terminated
at the end of the turn. Alliances do not allow land units
from the two powers to move, conduct sieges, assault, intercept, or
avoid battle together. Furthermore, Alliances do not create a new
state of war with any third party power (i.e., a power does not add
an “At War” marker with its new ally’s enemies). However, as
described above, all allied units will add to the defense of a space
even if only one of the defending powers is at war with the attacker.

13

9.3 Ransom of Leaders

The second segment of the Diplomacy Phase allows a power to
regain a captured army leader whose return was not negotiated in
the Negotiation Segment. The power that captured the army leader
randomly draws one card (the ransom) from the hand of the power
requesting the leader back. Place that army leader in his capital if
possible; if not place him in a friendly home key. Any number of
army leaders may be ransomed in this segment. However, there
is never any requirement to ransom an army leader; a power may
choose to let him remain a captive indefinitely.

9.4 Declarations of War

The third segment of the Diplomacy Phase allows a power to declare war on one or more other powers, major or minor. Follow the
DOW procedure below, completing in full for each power before
starting the procedure again for the next power in Impulse Order.

Declaration of War (DOW) Procedure

1. DOW on Major Powers: This power announces
whether or not they wish to declare war on one or more
major powers. For each such declaration, add an “At
War” marker to the appropriate box in the Diplomatic
Status Display. These powers are now at war until a peace is agreed
to in a future Diplomacy Phase.
2. DOW on Minor Powers: This player then announces whether or not he wishes his power to declare war on
one or more minor powers. For each such declaration,
add an “At War” marker to the appropriate box in the
Diplomatic Status Display. The declaration of war on a minor
power also triggers the resolution of that minor power’s diplomatic status (possibly allowing a major power to intervene on
behalf of this minor, see Step 4). Finally, remove the declaring
power’s Influence marker from this minor power’s column on the
Diplomatic Influence table; this major power may not influence
this minor for the rest of the game.
3. Pay DOW Costs: The player now computes the total CP cost
of the declarations he made in Steps 1 and 2. The cost of each
declaration is found by cross-referencing these two powers on the
Diplomatic Status Display and looking at the number found in the
appropriate box. [This cost is variable when Spain declares war
on England, see 9.5]. This power must play one or more cards or
treasures from his hand with a CP value that is equal to or greater
than the total CP expenditure. Those cards and treasures are placed
in the proper discard pile as if they had been played for CP in the
Action Phase (Section 11.0). Home cards and Mandatory Event
cards may not be used to declare war.
4. Intervention on Behalf of a Minor Power: If one or more war
declarations were directed at a minor power, resolve the Diplomatic
Status of each minor power as specified in 24.6 (if more than one
minor was the target of a DOW, the order of resolution is chosen
by the active player). Remove the power declaring war and any
power listed as a “Deactivate” power from those considered during this Diplomatic Status check. The power that wins the status
check earns the right to intervene on behalf of the Minor Power.
That player must then choose one of these options:
o	 Intervention: The minor becomes an ally of the power that
won the Diplomatic Status check. That winning power is now
at war with the major power that declared war on the minor
(even if those two powers had earlier declared an alliance for

14

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

the turn). If units from those powers share a space, displace all
units that are not in a space their power controls (12.5).
o	 Isolation: The right to add that minor power as an ally is
forfeited. However the power that won the Diplomatic Status
check does avoid going to war with the power that declared war.
The option to intervene now passes to the power that finished
second in the Diplomatic Status check. If this second power
also chooses isolation, than the minor remains inactive without
a major power ally.
No matter which option is chosen, all powers lose their diplomatic
influence with this minor (since it was reset during the Diplomatic
Status procedure).

DOW during the Action Phase

The following occurrences can place two major powers into a state
of war during the Action Phase:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The Ottoman Tribute or Holy Roman Intercession events,
Rebellion (18.4),
Spanish troops entering Scotland or Ireland,
English troops entering the Netherlands,
Activation of a minor power

In any of these cases, add an At War marker to the Diplomatic Status
Display. If naval units of the two powers now at war occupy the
same sea zone, fight an immediate naval battle between the two
powers with the power earlier in Impulse order as the attacker.

Restrictions on Declarations of War

There are several restrictions which apply to declarations of war.
Some of those restrictions apply at all times; others only apply
to declarations made during the War Segment of the Diplomacy
Phase, as detailed below.

Restrictions at All Times:
You can not declare war on:

•	 a power whose box on the Diplomatic Status Display lists
“N/A”, “Possible Ally”, or “Ally Only” as the cost of a war
declaration.
•	 a minor power that is allied to a major power (you have to
declare war on the major power instead).
•	 a power (major or minor) that is currently your ally.
•	 Portugal if the Death of King Sebastian Mandatory Event has
not yet been played.
•	 an independent fortified space (Metz or Florence) since those
independent spaces may be besieged by any power without a
DOW.

but ended as the bitterest of enemies. The rise in tensions between
these powers means the cost of a declaration of war between these
powers varies during the game. The cost starts at 5 CP. The following events reduce this cost:
•	 Papal Bull event causes Elizabeth to be excommunicated
(subtract 2 CP),
•	 Scottish Lords Rebel event causes Mary Queen of Scots to
be captured (subtract 2 CP),
•	 England chooses to execute Mary Queen of Scots after an assassination attempt on Elizabeth or after an English Catholic
Rebellion action (subtract 3 CP).
Markers are provided to track the status of
Mary Queen of Scots and to show that Elizabeth has been excommunicated. Place these
markers when any of the above events occur
so the current DOW cost between these powers can be easily computed. The cost can never drop below 1 CP.

Immediate War Triggers

In the bottom right corner of the Diplomatic Status Display is a
list of occurrences that immediately trigger a state of war between
England and Spain. If any of these triggers occur, England and
Spain immediately enter a state of war.

Spanish Units Entering Ireland or Scotland

As an exception to the normal rules for land and naval movement,
Spanish units may not enter a home space for the minor powers
Ireland and Scotland at the start of the game for any reason. However, once the cost of a DOW between England and Spain drops
to 3 CP or less, Spain may move land and naval units into home
spaces for these two powers. All normal conditions for entering a
space still apply (e.g., spaces must be controlled by a power that is
either allied to Spain or at war with Spain). A Spanish unit entering one of these spaces is an immediate war trigger (see above).

No Peace

Once at war, England and Spain may never agree to peace.

10. SPRING DEPLOYMENT

The third phase of each turn is Spring Deployment. At this time,
each major power undertakes a series of activities to prepare for the
upcoming Action Phase. Some steps in the procedure apply to only
one power; skip those that do not apply to you. The first player in
Impulse Order completes all the below steps before the next player
in Impulse Order begins this process.

Spring Deployment Procedure

Restrictions During Diplomacy Phase:
You can not declare war on:

• 	a power that you have made peace with during the current
Diplomacy Phase,
• 	a power that you have formed an alliance with during the current Diplomacy Phase.

9.5 War between England and Spain

Rules Manual

The one exception to the declaration of war rules listed above is
for declarations of war between England and Spain. These two
powers started the period represented in Virgin Queen as close
allies (Elizabeth and Philip were sister-in-law and brother-in-law)

1. Treasure Fleet Escorts: Spain may move galleons from home
ports to the Treasure Fleet Escorts box on the Spanish power
card or vice versa (but not in both directions in the same turn).
No more than 2 galleons may be present in the Treasure Fleet
Escort box at any time.
2. English Sea Captain Placement: The English have several
Sea Captains with a 1 Battle Rating. These units can serve as
either World Map sea captains or as Naval Leaders on the Europe
Map. At this time, the English player takes any sea captain he
wishes to use as a Naval Leader and places him on an English

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

naval unit in an English home port. Any captain placed on the
Europe Map functions as a naval leader for all purposes for the
remainder of the turn. Sea captains that wintered in an English
colony may not be moved at this time.
3. Holy Roman Religious Preference: If this is the first turn of
a 6-player game, the Holy Roman player must record their secret
Religious Preference. See 23.5.
4. Place Arriving Leaders: Now add army and naval leaders that
arrived this turn to play. Army leaders are placed in any fortified
home space under friendly control. Naval leaders are placed in
any home port under friendly control. If no such space exists, the
leader remains on the Turn Track until next turn. The Protestant
player has the option of not immediately adding his leaders to the
map and instead waiting to add them during a rebellion action.
If so, place them on the Protestant power card to show that they
are eligible to enter via rebellion. Don John is placed as either
an army leader or a naval leader. He may switch leader type at
any time during a Spanish impulse if he occupies a port space
under friendly control.
5. Choose Home Card: All major powers have two different
Home cards, though the second Home card for many players
does not enter play until after Turn 1. If this is a turn where your
power has more than one Home card, one of those two cards must
be secretly discarded from play at this time. (Exception: The
Ottoman does not have to discard a Home card when Suleiman
is ruler). Place the Home card that you do not want face down
on your power card. The card that you do want to use during
this turn’s Action Phase remains in your hand. Activated major
powers never receive any Home cards; discard all home cards
for these powers at this time.
6. Move Formation from Capital: All powers with a capital
(including activated major powers) may move a single formation from one of their capitals to a friendly-controlled space.
This special move costs no CP. The following restrictions apply:

Restrictions:

•	 Only land units and army leaders that start this phase in their
capital may use spring deployment. Spain and the Protestant
may use spring deployment from either one of their capitals
(but not both).
•	 The power must be able to trace a path of any length from their
capital to the destination space. All land spaces on the path must
be friendly-controlled and no land space on the path may be in
unrest. The path may also cross one sea zone (only) following
a path from one friendly-controlled port on that sea zone to
another.
•	 The number of land units in the formation is limited by the
command rating of any army leaders present.
•	 The path may not cross a Pass.
•	 If any other major power has naval units in ports that border a
sea zone, even naval units of an allied power, the path may not
cross that sea zone (unless those naval units have been loaned
to the deploying power for the turn).
•	 No more than 5 land units (plus army leaders) may cross a sea
zone during spring deployment.

15

11. THE ACTION PHASE

During the Action Phase, the powers take impulses in the order
described in Section 3.2. The power initiating an activity is referred
to as the “active power” throughout these rules. Each impulse starts
by completing one of the following three activities:
•	 Playing a card for Command Points (CP)
•	 Playing a card as an event
•	 Passing
Unless the power passed, he may then extend his impulse by playing a treasure.
Playing a card for Command Points (CP): All cards except
Mandatory Event cards can be played for CP during an impulse.
When played for CP, a card provides a number of CP equal to the
number in the shield in the upper-left corner of the card. These CP
are then expended to perform one or more of the actions listed in
Section 11.1 below. The card played is placed in the discard pile
and will be used again in future turns. Remember that a concise
list of the actions that a power may employ is given in the upper
left of their power card (Section 4) and that the background color
behind the name of the action within this list denotes the type of
each action. When playing a card for Command Points, players
should note the types of the actions they are selecting (because the
same action types may not be repeated if the impulse is extended
by play of a treasure).
Playing a card as an event: Mandatory Event cards, Home cards,
Event cards, and some Response cards (but never Combat cards)
may be played as events during a power’s impulse. Important Note:
some events may only be played by powers specified on the card,
or if certain conditions have been met. Read the printed effects on
the card and execute them immediately. Note that some Event cards
(and all Mandatory Event cards) grant CP that can be used with that
event; these CP are expended to perform any of the actions listed
in Section 11.1 below. After being played as an event, the card is
placed on the discard pile, unless the card text states “Remove from
deck if played as an event”; such cards are permanently removed
from the game. The cards Virgin Queen, Gouvernante de France
and Papal Bull allow a player to retrieve cards from the discard
pile; however, each card may only be played as an event once in
a given turn. You may play an event that directs another power to
take an action (for instance any power may play Sea Beggars to
allow the Protestant power to gain control of a space, add units,
and make a piracy attempt); in this case, the player listed on the
card resolves the action, not the active player.
Passing: Late in the Action Phase, powers may pass for their impulse. Powers may never pass if:
•	 Their Home card has not been played,
•	 A Mandatory Event is in their hand that has not been played,
or
•	 They have more cards in their hand than their ruler’s Administrative Rating.
A power must pass if it has no cards left in its hand. A power holding one or more cards that passes during an impulse does not have
to continue to pass. This power may play one of these held cards
when their turn for an impulse arises later in the Action Phase. The
Action Phase is over when all 6 powers have passed in consecutive impulses.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

16

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Extending the impulse with a treasure: As long as a player played
a card for either CP or as an event, he may extend the impulse by
also playing a treasure. Three types of treasures are resolved automatically when played:
•	 Draw Card: Discard the treasure and then draw a card from
the deck. The card must be held for a future impulse.
•	 Science Bonus: Immediately choose an unclaimed science
bonus for your power as if you earned it through Patronage
(22.2).
•	 1 VP: Place this treasure in your Bonus VP box. It does not go
to the treasure discard and reenter play.
All other treasures have a value in CP (from 1 to 5). When they
are played these CP are expended to perform actions just as if you
were playing a card for CP. However, the actions chosen must
all be of a different type than those chosen if a card was played
for CP earlier in the impulse (no such restriction exists if a card
was played as an event). If the impulse is extended after play of
a Mandatory Event, the actions while extending the impulse must
be a different type than the action(s) from the 2 CP received from
the Mandatory Event card.
EXAMPLE: Spain plays Morisco Revolt for 3 CP to start their
impulse. They build a galleon in Corunna at a cost of 2 CP and
then spend the final CP on 1 point of diplomatic influence on the
Papacy. Spain then extends their impulse with a 4 CP treasure.
Because they choose a blue (naval) action building the galleon
earlier in the turn, they may not choose any of these actions: Build
Galley, Galleon; Upgrade Armada, Naval Move, Initiate Piracy.
Likewise, Spain may not Buy Diplomatic Influence since they have
already performed that action. They will need to spend these 4 CP
on land (brown), piracy defense (gray), religious (purple), patronage (green), or espionage (yellow) actions.

11.1 Actions

Each action in the game costs from 1 to 5 CP. Exact rules for the
execution of each action are found throughout Sections 12 through
19 and in Section 22. Some actions cost a variable number of CP
(including Build Expedition, Assassination, English Catholic Rebellion, and Patronize Artist or Scientist actions). Spending a higher
number of CP on these actions increases their chance of success (or
allows colonists to be included with an expedition). CP are spent
on one action at a time. That action is then executed to completion
before any remaining CP are spent (i.e., actions are not predesignated). CP may not be accumulated from one impulse to another;
they must be spent (or discarded) in the impulse in which the card
that provided the CP was played. A power may choose to execute
the same action back-to-back within an impulse. This is very common with movement actions so units can move multiple spaces. It
is also common when constructing units (especially mercenaries)
and when playing CP to Buy Diplomatic Influence.
EXCEPTION: The actions Patronize Artist and Patronize Scientist
may each only be taken once per turn by a power.

Rules Manual

12. CONTROL AND UNREST

Political control of spaces can change based on actions (i.e., Control
unfortified space, or a successful assault), negotiation, or Event card
play. A line of communication (LOC) from a fortified home space is
required to initiate actions that change space control; rules for LOC
are therefore included in this section. Spaces can also enter unrest
through Event card play. If unrest is present in a space, most of the
benefits of controlling that space are lost. Unrest is removed through
the same action that is used to gain control of an unfortified space.

12.1 Line of Communication

A power has an LOC to a space if it can trace a path of spaces and
sea zones to that space from a friendly-controlled, fortified space
that is a home space for that power or one of its allies (this even
includes home spaces of minor powers allied to your major power
allies). All spaces on the path (except the space where the path
ends) must be:
•	 friendly-controlled,
•	 free of enemy units (including naval units and leaders), and
•	 free of unrest.
One or more adjacent sea zones may be part of the LOC if they each
contain a friendly naval unit. The path must connect to these sea
zones through a friendly-controlled port (except the space where the
path ends, which can be a non-friendly port). An LOC is required
for the Assault and Control Unfortified Space actions.

12.2 Unfortified Space

A power may spend 1 CP on the Control Unfortified Space action
to gain political control of a space if the following requirements
are all met:

Requirements:
•	
•	
•	
•	

The space is independent or controlled by an enemy power.
The space is unfortified.
The active power has an LOC to the space.
Either (a) land units controlled by the active power occupy
the space, or (b) land units controlled by the active power are
adjacent to the space and enemy land units are not adjacent.
[For the purposes of this requirement, two spaces connected
by a pass are not considered adjacent.]
•	 The space is not occupied by land units from another power
(unless those units are allies of the active power).

NOTE: In case (b) above, the land units controlled by the active
power adjacent to the space do not have to have an LOC themselves;
the LOC requirement is only to the space being converted. Units
conducting a siege and under siege must all still be considered
when evaluating case (b).
Place a new control marker on the space to indicate the new
owner (unless it is reverting to its original owner and no marker is
required). Make sure to place the new marker on the proper side
so the religious influence is unchanged. If this space is a port that
contains naval units, those naval units must immediately retreat to
a sea zone adjacent to that port following the instructions found in
Step 9 of the Naval Combat Procedure.

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

12.3 Fortified Space

Political control of fortified spaces only changes based on Negotiation (Section 9.1), Siege (Section 15), Rebellion (Section 18.4),
and Event card play. See the appropriate section for further details.

12.4 Unrest

Unrest markers are placed on spaces due to Protestant
and Catholic Conversion attempts (Section 18) and
numerous events. Four events (Homeland Uprising,
Morisco Revolt, Puritans, and Rising of the North)
specify that markers must be placed in unoccupied spaces; these
are spaces that do not contain land or naval units (or leaders) of
any power. All other causes of unrest can affect occupied spaces.
Unrest has the following effects:

are placed in the nearest port controlled by their power. Count sea
zones as a space when determining the shortest path. If two spaces
are equidistant, the space is chosen by the owning player.

13. Movement

A power may move land units with either the Move Formation In
Clear action (1 CP) or the Move Formation Over Pass action (2
CP). All land movement is restricted by the formation rules (Section 5.1). Land movement may trigger interception attempts by
enemy formations. Enemy stacks are also allowed to try to avoid
battle and withdraw into fortifications in response to Move actions.

13.1 Land Movement Procedure

The following restrictions limit the use of a Move action.

Effects:

•	 Units may not use spring deployment, retreat, or avoid battle
into or through a space in unrest.
•	 No LOC can be traced through a space in unrest.
•	 No units may be constructed in a space in unrest.
•	 A Protestant Conversion attempt may not be initiated against
an adjacent space if a space in unrest is the only space under
Protestant religious influence adjacent to that target space.
•	 A Catholic Conversion attempt may not be initiated against
an adjacent space if a space in unrest is the only space under
Catholic religious influence adjacent to that target space.
•	 The space is not considered to be Protestant when computing
victory points (VP).
•	 A key in unrest is not credited when tracking the number of VP
earned and cards to draw. Place an additional Unrest marker on
one key box of the affected power’s card for each key under
unrest. Remove these markers when the unrest is removed from
that key.
•	 A fortress in unrest does not roll a die against a piracy attempt
in an adjacent sea zone.

Spaces under unrest may be the target of Protestant and Catholic
Conversion attempts or Rebellions.

Removing Unrest

A power may spend 1 CP on the Control Unfortified Space action to
remove unrest from a space if at least one of these conditions is met:
a. land units controlled by the active power occupy the space,
b. land units controlled by the active power are adjacent to the
space and land units of an enemy power are not adjacent. [For
the purposes of this condition, two spaces connected by a pass
should not be considered adjacent.]
Removing unrest does not require an LOC to a space in order to
remove unrest (unlike gaining political of an unfortified space where
an LOC is required).

12.5 Displacement

17

If control of a space changes due to negotiation, intervention after
DOW on a minor power, rebellion, or an event card play, units
friendly to the previous owner of the space may be displaced as
described on specific cards and rule sections. When displacement
occurs, any land units and army leaders occupying these spaces are
placed in the nearest fortified space controlled by their power or
in their capital (if under friendly control). Naval units and leaders

Restrictions:

• 	All land units and army leaders being moved must start the
action in the same space and it must be permissible to move
them in a single formation.
• 	Formations may always move into a space controlled by their
power or into an independent space. A formation may only
move into a space controlled by another power if either:
◊	 the active power is at war with the power controlling the
destination space, or
◊	 the active power is allied with the power controlling the
destination space.
•	 Formations may not move into a space containing land units
from another power unless the space satisfies one of these
conditions:
◊ 	all units in the space are allies of the active power (and this
is not a fortified space where one ally has another ally under
siege);
◊ 	all units in the space are enemies of the active power (and
this is not a fortified space where one enemy has another
enemy under siege);
◊ 	this is a space controlled by an enemy power and all units
in the space are either from that enemy power or allied to
them. When resolving this movement, treat the units already
in the space as “enemy units” for all purposes. Adjacent units
from a power with units in the space are also considered as
enemy units and may intercept into the space if desired;
◊ 	this is a fortified space under siege where either: (a) all units
inside the fortification are allied to the active power and all
besieging units are enemies of the active power, or (b) all
units inside the fortification are enemies of the active power
and all besieging units are allied to the active power.

Independent regulars in an independent key (Section 22.6) never
prevent the entry of a formation, though that formation might have
to fight off troops from an enemy power before being able to siege
the independent key.
•	 No army leader or unit may participate in a Move action if
it was part of a formation that lost a field battle earlier in the
impulse.
•	 No army leader or unit may participate in a Move action if it
occupies an enemy fortified space that their power placed under
siege (Section 15) earlier in the impulse.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

18

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

•	 One or more army leaders may move without accompanying
land units as long as they don’t enter a space controlled by an
enemy power or containing enemy units. If an army leader is
ever alone in an unfortified space when enemy land units enter
due to enemy movement, retreat, or interception, that leader is
captured. Place the captured leader on the enemy power card.
He may be regained in the Diplomacy Phase of an upcoming
turn (see Section 9).

The two Move actions follow the same procedure:
Land Movement Procedure

1. Declare Formation: The active power declares which formation of land units and army leaders will be moved.
2. Declare Destination Space: The active power declares the
destination space for the move. The destination must be adjacent
to the formation’s current space.
3. Expend CP: Two CP are expended if the move is over a pass;
otherwise the cost is just one CP.
4. Play Response Cards: Other powers may play the Response
card Storms to disrupt this Move action.
5. Conduct any Interceptions: Interceptions (Section 13.2)
may occur if an enemy stack is adjacent to the destination space.
Interceptions may add enemy units to the space being entered.
Once all interceptions have been resolved, the land units and army
leaders being moved are placed in the destination space. If any
interceptions succeeded, skip to Step 8 and resolve a field battle.
6. Conduct Avoid Battle: If the destination space contains
enemy land units, all or some of them may try to avoid battle
(Section 13.3).
7. Withdraw into Fortification: If after unsuccessful interception and avoid battle attempts (if any) the enemy stack in
a fortified destination space has 4 or fewer units present, those
enemy units have the option of withdrawing into fortifications
(Section 13.4).
8. Fight Field Battle: If enemy land units are still present in the
space, and those land units are not inside fortifications, then a
field battle occurs in this space (Section 14).

13.2 Interception

An enemy power with land units adjacent to a Move action’s destination space may attempt to intercept the moving formation. If
multiple enemy stacks are adjacent to the destination space, each
may attempt to intercept. Each such attempt is announced and
resolved before announcing and resolving any other attempts. If
multiple stacks from different enemy powers all want to intercept,
resolve the interception attempts in Impulse Order. Once one power
succeeds, no other power may attempt an interception (even if
that other power is an ally of the intercepting power). Formations
belonging to the successful intercepting power may however continue to attempt to intercept from any number of adjacent spaces.

Restrictions:

•	 Formations moving due to avoid battle, interception, and retreats may not be intercepted.
•	 Formations may never intercept across a pass.
•	 Only units of a power that is At War with the active power may
intercept.

Rules Manual

•	 Units and army leaders that have already tried to intercept a
movement in this same impulse (whether or not they were
successful) may not try to intercept again.
•	 Units and army leaders currently under siege may not try to
intercept. If a besieging force moves out of a space under siege,
the stack formerly under siege may not intercept the move out
of that fortified space.
•	 All land units and army leaders allocated in Step 1 of the Interception Procedure (see below) must start the Move action
in the same space and it must be permissible to move them in
a single formation.
•	 Leaders may not intercept by themselves unless the destination
space contains units friendly to that leader.
•	 Formations moving into a friendly fortified space that is not
under siege may not be intercepted.
•	 Formations moving into a space that already contains land units
may only be intercepted if the intercepting units belong to the
same power as the units in the destination space, or to a power
allied to the units in the destination space. Such an interception
is not allowed if there are units under siege (from any power)
in that space at the start of the active formation’s move.
•	 Units may not intercept into a space controlled by another power
unless the power controlling the space is either an enemy or an
ally of the intercepting units.

Interception Procedure

1. Declare Formation: An intercepting power with land units
and/or army leaders in a space adjacent to the movement destination declares which formation will attempt an interception.
This formation does not need to include all of the units present.
2. Roll Dice: The intercepting power rolls two dice and adds the
best single Battle Rating of an army leader (if any) in the intercepting formation to the dice sum. The Ottoman power adds 1 to
its result if at least 1 cavalry unit is in the intercepting formation.
A non-Ottoman power subtracts 1 from the result if it is trying
to intercept a stack containing Ottoman cavalry. A power with
the Telescope science bonus adds 1. If the modified dice roll is
9 or more, the Interception Attempt is successful.
3. Place in Destination Space: If successful, the intercepting
formation is placed in the destination space. This formation is
treated as if it were present in the space before the moving formation arrived. Once one power succeeds, no other power may
attempt an intercept (even if that other power is an ally of the
intercepting power).
4. Repeat for other Formations: Return to Steps 1-3 and resolve
interception attempts from any other adjacent space. Additional
attempts from a space already chosen in Step 1 are not permitted.
5. Fight Field Battle: If any of the interceptions were successful,
fight a field battle (Section 14) in the destination space. All units
from the intercepting power must participate in this battle; they
may not avoid battle or withdraw into a fortification.

13.3 Avoid Battle

When a power enters a space containing a stack of enemy land units,
some or all of those enemy units may try to move to an adjacent
space to avoid battle. If the destination space contains land units
from more than one major power (who are allies), each major power
may, in impulse order, announce and resolve an avoid battle attempt.
Each such attempt is announced and resolved before announcing and

Rules Manual

resolving any other attempts. Minor power allies in that space avoid
battle as a single group with units of their affiliated major power. A
power is never required to try to avoid battle; it is always optional.

Restrictions:

•	 Units may not avoid battle into an independent space or a space
controlled by another power unless that power is an ally of the
power avoiding battle.
•	 Units may not avoid battle into a space in unrest or a space
containing enemy units.
•	 Land units may not avoid battle into a sea zone.
•	 Units may not avoid battle into the space just vacated by the
enemy formation the units are trying to avoid.
•	 Units and army leaders currently under siege may not avoid
battle.
•	 Units of a power may not avoid battle if any units of that power
intercepted into the battle space during this Move action.
•	 A leader alone in a space may not avoid battle. (If the space
is unfortified, he is captured (13.1); if the space is fortified he
must withdraw inside).

Avoid Battle Procedure

1. Declare Attempts: Each major power with land units in the
destination space of the Move action declares and resolves (in
impulse order) an avoid battle attempt. Follow steps 2-5 for each
such power before going on to the next.

2. Designate Destination Space: This power designates an adjacent space into which the units avoiding battle will try to move.
The space must satisfy the restrictions listed above.
3. Choose Units: The power chooses which land units and army
leaders will attempt to avoid battle. The total number of units
chosen may exceed the number that can be moved as a single
formation. Any number of units may be left out of the avoid
battle attempt (you can even leave out all land units to have an
army leader avoid battle by himself).
4. Roll Dice: The power avoiding battle rolls two dice and adds
the best single Battle Rating of an army leader (if any) present in
the stack of units leaving the space to the dice sum. The Ottoman
power adds 1 to its result if at least 1 cavalry unit is in the stack
avoiding battle. A non-Ottoman power subtracts 1 from the result
if it is trying to avoid a formation containing Ottoman cavalry. A
power with the Telescope science bonus adds 1. If the modified
dice roll is 9 or more, the Avoid Battle Attempt is successful.
Exception: If every unit in the formation attempting to Avoid
Battle has already lost a field battle during this impulse, it may
Avoid Battle automatically—no dice roll is necessary.
5. Place in Destination Space: If successful, the units selected
to avoid battle are placed in the chosen adjacent space.
6. Repeat for other Formations: Return to Steps 2-5 for each remaining power with units in the destination space of the Move action.

13.4 Withdrawing into Fortifications

Enemy units in the destination space may withdraw inside fortifications in Step 7 of the movement procedure if the following
conditions are all met:
•	 the destination space is fortified,
•	 the enemy power (or an ally of the enemy power) controls the
destination space,

19

•	 there were 4 or fewer units (plus any number of army leaders)
present in the space after interception and avoid battle attempts
were resolved.
A power is never required to withdraw into its fortifications; it is
always optional. If they do withdraw, all units present must withdraw together. If units from more than one power are defending the
space when the active formation enters, the power controlling the
space decides whether or not to withdraw into the fortifications. If
the units decide to withdraw inside fortifications, a field battle is
avoided during this impulse. If the active formation has more units
than the number of units inside the fortification, this fortification
is now under siege (Section 15). If the active formation does not
have more units, it has two choices:
1. If there are CP remaining to be played in this impulse, the
active formation may spend 1 CP (or 2 CP if the move is over a
pass) to continue movement into an adjacent space. [However,
if they are later forced to retreat from this new space back into
the fortified space, they are eliminated.]
2. Otherwise the active formation must retreat back into the space
from which it entered the fortified space. This retreat does not
cost any CP, but the retreat must abide by all retreat restrictions
listed in Section 14.1.

14. Field Battle

A field battle occurs due to a Move action into a space occupied by
an enemy formation or because of a successful interception. Each
power involved adds up how many battle dice they will roll. This
number of dice is then rolled to see how many “hits” are scored.
Each hit inflicts a casualty on the opponent. The side which scores
the most hits on its opponent is the victor and retains the space. The
defeated force must then retreat to an adjacent space.

Field Battle Procedure

1. Play Response Cards: Both sides (starting with the attacker)
have one final chance to play the Response card Reiters to change
the number of units in the space.
2. Attacker Adds Up Battle Dice: The active player is always
considered the attacker in a field battle. The attacker adds up the
number of dice he will roll as follows:
•	 1 die for each land unit in the moving formation.
•	 1 die for each Battle Rating point from the highest-rated
leader in the attacking force.

3. Defender Adds Up Battle Dice: The intercepting player or the
player with the stack of units in the destination space is always
considered the defender in a field battle. The defender adds up
the number of dice he will roll as follows:
•	 1 die for each defending land unit in the space.
•	 1 die for each Battle Rating point from the highest-rated
leader in the defending force.
•	 1 die for being the defender.
4. Attacker Declares Combat Cards: The attacker declares
any Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the battle.
5. Defender Declares Combat Cards: The defender declares
any Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the battle.
If more than one major power is controlling defending units in
this space, each of these powers may play Combat cards.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

20

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

6. Roll Dice: Both sides roll their dice. Each roll of a “5” or a
“6” is considered to be a hit.
7. Declare Winner: The side scoring the most hits is declared
the winner of the battle. In the case of a tie, the defender is
declared the winner.
8. Take Casualties: Each side eliminates 1 land unit for each hit
scored by the opposing side. If both sides are eliminated, the side
that rolled more dice retains 1 unit. If both sides are eliminated
and the two sides rolled the same number of dice, the defender
retains 1 unit.
9. Capture Leaders: If one or more leaders are present on a side
that is completely eliminated, they are captured by the enemy.
Place a captured leader on the power card of the adversary which
defeated him. He may be regained in the Diplomacy Phase of an
upcoming turn (see Section 9).
10. Conduct Retreats: The units of the losing power retreat as
described in 14.1 (unless they were all eliminated).
11. Check for Siege: If the battle occurred in a fortified space
and the active player won, check to see if the active formation
has more units than the losing player has inside the fortifications. If so, this space is now under siege (Section 15). If not,
the active player must retreat his force as specified in Section
15.3, Breaking a Siege.

14.1 Retreat

All remaining units and army leaders from the losing power must
retreat. If the battle occurred in a fortified space, and the power
controlling that space lost the battle, then any number of land units
up to four (at the owner’s discretion), and any number of army
leaders, may withdraw into the fortifications. The stack of units
remaining outside the fortifications after such a withdrawal (or all
losing power units if the battle did not occur in a fortified space)
must then retreat to a single adjacent space chosen by the owner of
those units. That space must meet all the restrictions listed below.
If no legal space exists, all units in that stack are eliminated; any
army leaders present are captured.

Restrictions:

•	 Units may not retreat into a space in unrest or a space containing enemy units.
•	 Land units may not retreat into a sea zone.
•	 Units may not retreat into an independent space or a space
controlled by another power unless that power is an ally of the
retreating power.
•	 If the defender lost the battle, his units may not retreat into the
space from which the enemy entered.
•	 If the active power lost the battle, the space chosen must be the
space from which this formation entered the battle.

Rules Manual

15. Siege

Land units in a fortified space are placed under siege if they withdraw into fortifications during enemy movement (Section 13.4)
or after a field battle (Section 14.1) and enemy land units in that
space outnumber them. The land units under siege may not move,
attack, intercept, or avoid battle until the siege is broken (Section
15.3). (Naval units in a port under siege may move). Note that it
is possible for a fortified space to be under siege by two powers at
once if those powers are allies, both are at war with the power that
controls this fortified space, and each power possesses more units
in the space than the power inside the fortifications.

15.1 Assault

A besieging power may spend 1 CP on the Assault/Foreign War
action in an attempt to gain control of the space, but not in the same
impulse in which the space was first put under siege by that power.
A space may only be subjected to one assault in a single impulse
(though a power may initiate multiple assaults in different spaces
in the same impulse). Assaults are conducted by a single formation
of units and army leaders in the same space as the fortification.
Requirements for an Assault action are as follows:

Requirements:

•	 Units controlled by the active power must have placed the
space under siege during a previous impulse. Fortified spaces
that are empty also have to be put under siege in one impulse
before they can be assaulted in a later impulse.
•	 The assaulting power has an LOC to the space.
•	 The power that controls the fortified space does not have a
naval unit in an adjacent sea zone.
•	 If the power that controls the fortified space has naval unit(s)
in that space, there is a greater number of naval units from the
assaulting power in adjacent sea zone(s).

Corsairs are ignored for the purpose of these last two requirements
(naval blockade).

Assault Procedure

1. Declare Formation: The active player declares which formation of land units and army leaders will be making the assault. All
requirements listed above must be met at this time.
2. Play Response Cards: Other powers may play the Response
card Storms to disrupt this Assault action. The active player has
one final chance to play the Response card Reiters to change the
number of units in the space.
3. Add Up Attacker’s Dice: The active player is always considered
the attacker in an assault. The attacker adds up the number of dice
he will roll as follows:
If against a fortified space with no defending land units:
• 1 die for each land unit in the assaulting formation (cavalry
units are ignored).
• 1 die for each Battle Rating point from the highest-rated leader
in the assaulting force.
If against a fortified space with 1 or more defending land units
(even if all units are cavalry):
• 1 die for every 2 land units in the assaulting formation (cavalry
units are ignored), round fractions up.

• 1 die for each Battle Rating point from the highest-rated leader
in the assaulting force.

battle if he does not want to risk losing them. There are three possible results in this relief force situation:

4. Add Up Defender’s Dice: The player controlling the space is
always considered the defender in an assault. The defender adds
up the number of dice he will roll as follows:

•	 If the active player wins the resulting battle, the besieging forces
retreat and the siege is broken.
•	 If the active player loses the battle but the number of hits scored
by both sides is equal, the active player may choose to retreat
any units or army leaders that participated in the battle into the
fortifications (including units that were part of the relief force
that entered the space). The total number of units inside the
fortification may never exceed 4 after such a retreat. All other
attacking units retreat as per Section 14.1.
•	 If the active player loses the battle and the number of hits he
scored was less than his opponent, only units that started the
impulse inside the fortification may retreat back inside. All other
attacking units retreat as per Section 14.1. If all attacking units
in the relief force were eliminated, any attacking army leaders
in the relief force are captured and there is no retreat.

• 1 die for each defending land unit in the space (cavalry units
are ignored).
• 1 die for each Battle Rating point from the highest-rated leader
in the defending force.
• 1 die for being the defender (2 if this power has the Ravelin
science bonus).
5. Attacker Declares Combat Cards: The attacker declares any
Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the assault.
6. Defender Declares Combat Cards: The defender declares any
Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the assault. If
more than one major power is controlling defending units in this
space, each of these powers may play Combat cards.
7. Roll Dice: Both players roll their dice and add up the number
of hits they have scored. Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is considered
to be a hit.
8. Take Casualties: Each side eliminates one land unit from their
stack of units in the space for each hit scored by the opposing side.
(Cavalry units may be taken as losses.)
9. Successful Assault: If the attacker scored at least 1 hit, no defending land units remain in the space, and at least 1 attacking unit
survived the battle, the assault is successful. The attacker gains political control of the space. All besieged army leaders are captured.
Place a captured leader on the power card of the adversary who
defeated him. He may be regained in the Diplomacy Phase of an
upcoming turn (see Section 9). If the defender has naval units or a
naval leader in the space, place them on the next turn of the Turn
Track. In a future turn, the leader will reenter play and the naval
units may be rebuilt. The Response card Sack! (or Spanish Fury if
this assault was at a key) may be played.
10. Unsuccessful Assault: If no attacking land units remain, the
attacker did not score at least one hit, or any besieged land units
remain, the assault is unsuccessful. If the number of besieging land
units still exceeds the number of defending land units, the space
remains under siege. If not, the attacking force must retreat as described in 15.3. If all attacking land units are eliminated, surviving
attacking army leaders are displaced (12.5).
If, earlier in the impulse, units and leaders joined a stack of that
power’s units already besieging a fortified space, those newly arrived units and leaders may participate in the assault and can be
included in the calculation in Step 3 (provided that the full complement of attacking forces used can fit within a single formation).

15.2 Relief Forces

A formation friendly to the units in the fortification may enter a
fortified space under siege and initiate a field battle in an attempt
to break the siege. In this “relief force” situation, units and army
leaders inside the fortification that are controlled by the same major
power as the relief force may participate in the field battle. These
forces inside the fortification may participate even if the total number of units now exceeds the allowable formation size (based on the
leaders present in that space). The player may choose to withhold
units that started the impulse within the fortification from the field

15.3 Breaking a Siege

A siege is broken immediately if the besieging stack no longer
contains more land units than are in the fortification (cavalry units
are included in these counts). This may occur if part of the besieging force leaves the space as part of a Move action, a successful
interception, or a successful avoid battle attempt. It may also occur
if the besieging stack takes severe losses during an assault or battle
against a relief force, or due to an Event card play. When the siege
is broken, the stack must retreat to any adjacent space that meets
the following restrictions. This retreat does not cost any CP. If no
such legal space exists, all units in that stack are eliminated; any
army leaders present are captured.

Restrictions:

•	 Units may not retreat into a space in unrest or a space containing units that are not from (or allied to) the retreating power.
•	 Units may not retreat into a sea zone.
•	 Units may not retreat into an independent space or a space
controlled by another power unless that power is an ally of the
retreating power.

16. NAVAL AFFAIRS

Naval units move, fight, intercept, and avoid battle in the sea zones
and ports of the map, much as land units do in the spaces of the
map. Naval units also provide a transport capability that allows
land units to traverse sea zones (as long as that movement takes
place in a single impulse). Naval units can also initiate piracy in
sea zones against enemy ports (or against any port in the case of
Ottoman corsairs). Sea captains use naval movement to traverse
the ocean zones of the map attempting to found colonies, initiate
World Map piracy, and circumnavigate the globe.

16.1 Naval Movement

A power may move naval units with the Naval Move action (1 CP).
Unlike land movement (where a Move action allows just one formation to move), the Naval Move action allows ALL naval units and
sea captains of that power (and their activated Minor Power allies
and any lent fleets) to perform a move, wherever they are on the
map. Naval units on the Europe Map and sea captains and patrols
on the World Map may each move based on the expenditure of the
same CP. Naval movement into sea zones (but not ocean zones)

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

22

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

may trigger interception attempts by enemy naval units. Enemy
naval units in sea zones are also allowed to try to avoid battle in
response to Naval Move actions.
All naval moves are to an “adjacent” location. Ports are adjacent to
one or two sea zones, as marked with the anchor symbol. Sea zones
are adjacent to all ports with symbols in their zone and all sea zones
that share a common sea zone boundary. Ocean zones are adjacent
to all ocean zones that share a common ocean zone boundary and to
ocean zones they are linked to by hazardous passage. Unlike ports,
World Map settlement spaces may not be entered by sea captains or
patrols. In addition, ocean zones and sea zones are never adjacent.
Naval units of two different powers that are not at war may occupy
the same sea zone after a move. (Sea captains and patrols may
occupy the same ocean zone even if their two powers are at war).
Interception attempts, avoid battle attempts, and naval combat are
only triggered against enemy naval units. Naval movements must
comply with the following restrictions:

Restrictions:

•	 Naval units must always move to an adjacent location. Movement from the Ionian Sea to the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Barbary
Coast to the Atlantic Ocean (or vice versa for any of these
combinations) is not permitted since these sea zones are not
adjacent (see Port in Section 2.5).
•	 Naval units may only move to ports controlled by another
player if enemy naval units are present in that port. (This
restriction prohibits naval moves into a port controlled by a
major power ally.)
•	 Naval leaders must be in the same stack as a naval unit controlled by the same power whenever possible. Naval leaders
may accompany any naval unit that is moving from the naval
leader’s port or sea zone. If naval movement is going to empty
the naval leader’s port or sea zone, then that naval leader must
accompany one of the naval units that is leaving.
•	 No naval unit may participate in a Naval Move if it was part
of a stack of naval units that lost a naval combat earlier in the
impulse.

Naval Movement Procedure

1. Declare Naval Moves: The active power declares which naval
units and leaders will be moving and designates the destination for
each of these units. Each unit’s destination must be adjacent to its
current location.
2. Execute Naval Move: The active power executes all naval
moves. The order of execution is not important as all moves are
considered simultaneous. Stack the newly arriving unit(s) in the
destination port, sea zone, or ocean zone as follows:
• 	If arriving in a port: the arriving naval unit(s) are placed below any land units and army leaders and are oriented normally
(horizontally).
• 	If arriving in a sea zone containing friendly units: the arriving naval unit(s) are placed on top of the other friendly units
and oriented the same way as those units.
• 	If arriving in a sea zone with no friendly units: the arriving
naval unit(s) are placed in the zone rotated 90 degrees (so they
are oriented vertically).
•	 If arriving in an ocean zone: If the expedition crossed a Hazardous Passage to reach this zone, or it moved in the opposite
direction as a Trade Wind arrow, it must survive a Navigation

Rules Manual

Check. Roll two dice and add the Sea Captain’s Navigation
rating. Add 1 more if this power has the Map Projection science
bonus. The modified die roll is then located on the Navigation
Table. Results are:
Eliminated: The sea captain is removed from the game.
Any colony aboard is lost (though it may be added to an
expedition built later in the game); any loot (treasures from
piracy) is immediately discarded.
Damaged: An undamaged expedition is flipped to the
Damaged side. If the expedition had 2 treasures of loot
from piracy, 1 treasure is lost (owning player’s choice). If
the expedition was already damaged, this voyage is ended;
place the sea captain on the Turn Track to enter next turn.
Any colony aboard is lost (though it may be added to an
expedition built later in the game); any loot is immediately
discarded.
If the expedition survived any required Navigation roll, is carrying
a colony, and there is an unoccupied gray settlement space (other
than the Philippines) connected to this ocean zone, the active power
may place the colony from this expedition on the settlement. Once
placed, colonies may not be moved.
3. Play Response Cards: Other powers may play the Response
card Storms to disrupt this Naval Move action.
4. Conduct Interceptions: Stacks of naval units that are oriented
vertically may be intercepted by enemy naval units in an adjacent
location. If multiple enemy stacks are adjacent to the destination
space, one or more naval units (owning player’s choice) from each
stack may attempt to intercept as a single stack. Each such attempt
is resolved separately and the owning player chooses the order of
those attempts. If multiple stacks from different enemy powers all
want to intercept, resolve the intercept attempts in Impulse Order.

Restrictions:

•	 Once one power succeeds, no other power may attempt an interception (even if that other power is an ally of the intercepting
power).
•	 Interception may not be attempted by naval unit(s) in a location
that now contains naval units from the active power.
•	 Interception may not be attempted into a destination space that
contains one or more enemy naval units hostile to the intercepting power that are still oriented normally.

The intercepting power rolls two dice and adds the Battle Rating
of any naval leader present to the dice sum. Subtract 1 from the
sum if a galleon, race-built galleon, or the Armada is present in the
intercepting units and this is a Mediterranean sea zone. A power
with the Telescope science bonus adds 1. A result of 9 or greater
indicates success. If successful, the intercepting naval units are
placed in the destination space and are oriented vertically. All stacks
that successfully intercept are combined into a single stack (and
will fight as a combined force in the naval combat in Step 7 below).
5. Conduct Avoid Battle: Enemy naval units in sea zones (not
ports) may try to avoid battle if both of these conditions are met
(these conditions represent a sea zone entered by the active power
in Step 2 in which no intercept occurred in Step 4):
•	 All enemy naval units are oriented normally.
•	 The naval units of the active power are oriented vertically.
Resolve avoid battle attempts in Impulse Order. The enemy power
attempting to avoid battle designates an adjacent location into which

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Rules Manual

the naval units will try to move. Adjacent ports must be controlled
by the power avoiding battle; adjacent sea zones may not contain
units from a power at war with the power avoiding battle. All of this
power’s naval units in the sea zone must avoid battle together. The
power avoiding battle rolls two dice and adds the Battle Rating of
any naval leader present to the dice sum. Subtract 1 from the sum
if a galleon, race-built galleon, or the Armada is present in the units
avoiding battle and this is a Mediterranean sea zone. A power with
the Telescope science bonus adds 1. If the modified dice roll is 9
or more, the Avoid Battle Attempt is successful. If successful, the
units are placed in the chosen adjacent location.
6. Rotate Units: After all avoid battle attempts are complete, rotate
all units that are oriented vertically to a normal orientation.
7. Conduct Naval Combat: If naval units of the active power and
an enemy power occupy the same sea zone or port, naval combat occurs in that location. The active power resolves the naval
combats that result from a Naval Move in any order it desires. If
more than one enemy power is present in that sea zone, the active
power chooses which one to fight first (allied enemy stacks are not
combined); he must continue fighting enemy naval forces until he
either loses a combat (and retreats) or has fought each enemy once.

16.2 Naval Combat

Naval combat occurs due to a Naval Move action into a sea zone
or port occupied by enemy naval units or because of a successful
interception. Each power involved adds up their combat dice and
rolls to see how many hits they score. Hits may cause casualties
on the opponent. The side with the most hits is the victor. After
the combat, one side’s units must retreat to an adjacent location.

Naval Combat Procedure

1. Attacker Adds Up Dice: The active player is always considered
the attacker in a naval combat. The attacker adds up the number of
dice he will roll per the table below.
2. Defender Adds Up Dice: The intercepting player or the player
with the stack of units that began the Naval Move action in the
destination location is always considered the defender in a naval
combat. The defender adds up the number of dice he will roll per
the table below.
Naval Combat Dice Rolled
1 die for each corsair or galley (if this galley is participating in
a combat in an Atlantic sea zone).
2 dice for each galleon, race-built galleon, or galley (if this galley
is participating in a combat in a port or Mediterranean sea zone).
2, 4, 6 or 8 dice for the Spanish Armada (23.2).
1 die for each Battle Rating point from their highest-rated naval
leader in the sea zone or port.
1 die for being the defender, but only if this combat is taking
place in a port.
3. Attacker Declares Combat Cards: The attacker declares any
Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the combat.
4. Defender Declares Combat Cards: The defender declares any
Combat cards he wants to play as events to affect the combat.
5. Roll Dice: Both players roll their dice. Each side adds up the
number of hits they have scored. Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is
considered to be a hit.

23

6. Play Response Cards: If this combat occurred in a Mediterranean sea zone, any power may play the Response card Galleasses
to give one side an attempt to score additional hits.
7. Declare Winner: The side scoring the most hits is declared the
winner of the battle. In the case of a tie, the defender is declared
the winner.
8. Take Casualties: Each side eliminates 1 galley, galleon, or racebuilt galleon for every 2 hits scored by the opposing side. The player
losing the unit(s) gets to choose which units are eliminated from
play if more than one is present. If England was participating in the
combat with race-built galleons in a sea zone (not a port), they may
ignore one hit with a “5” for each race-built galleon involved in
the fight. These hits are only ignored during this “Take Casualties”
step; they still count when determining the winner of the combat
in Step 7. If hits against the Ottoman power remain after applying
hits to galleys, each remaining hit eliminates 1 corsair. Odd hits
remaining against the losing side eliminate 1 extra galley, galleon
or race-built galleon; odd hits remaining against the winner are
ignored. If both sides are eliminated, the side that rolled more dice
retains 1 unit. If both sides are eliminated and the two sides rolled
the same number of dice, the defender retains 1 unit.
9. One Power Retreats: If the combat occurred in a port, the attacker retreats to a sea zone connected to that port that is free of
enemy naval units. (NOTE: The attacker retreats regardless of
whether or not he won the battle.) If the combat occurred in a sea
zone, the loser retreats to an adjacent port under its control (free of
enemy naval units) or an adjacent sea zone (also free of enemy naval
units). If no such location exists, the naval units are eliminated.
10. Place Units on Turn Track: If one or more naval leaders are
present on a side that is completely eliminated, they are placed on
the next turn of the Turn Track. All naval units lost in the combat
are also placed there. In a future turn, the leader will reenter play
and the naval units may be rebuilt (8.1). (Exception: A power with
the Dry Dock science bonus returns naval units to their force pool
immediately).

16.3 Naval Transport

If a power has naval units in one or more adjacent sea zones, it may
make a special move of lands units across those sea zones. This
special move is called “naval transport” and is considered to be a
special case of the Move Formation In Clear action.

Naval Transport Procedure

1. Spend CP and Move: The active power must have at least 2 CP
remaining to spend in the current Action Phase. If so, a formation
of 5 or fewer land units (plus army leaders) in a port may move to
an adjacent sea zone containing naval units controlled by the active power. This move costs 1 CP and is considered to be a Move
Formation in Clear action. Units moving by naval transport may
not be intercepted at sea. Other powers may play the Response card
Storms to disrupt naval transport. A formation under siege may not
be moved by naval transport.
2. Multi-zone Transport: The active power then continues to
move the formation to an adjacent sea zone or port at the cost of 1
CP for each such move. Moves from one sea zone to another are
permitted as long as the power has a naval unit in each sea zone and
enough CP to get the formation back to a port before the impulse is
over. Formations may never end an impulse at sea. You must end
a naval transport with one formation before starting another one
later in the impulse.

3. End at Port: Formations end their naval transport by moving
to a port adjacent to the last sea zone they entered. That port must
conform to the following restrictions:

b) If hits remain after Step (a), eliminate 1 naval unit from the
active power’s stack for every 2 hits scored (units eliminated
are chosen by active player).

•	 The port may not contain any enemy naval units.
•	 It must be a space into which the power could move using land
movement (i.e., it can not be a port of a power that the active
power is neither allied with nor at war with).

c) If exactly 1 hit remains after Step (b), eliminate 1 extra naval
unit (again chosen by active player).

Treat this movement into the final space as if it were a Move action.
Enemy units may intercept, avoid battle, withdraw into fortifications
or stay and force a field battle.
4. Naval Transport and Field Battles: If the active power loses
a field battle in the port space at the end of a naval transport, all
transported units are eliminated and any army leaders present are
captured.

16.4 Piracy on the Europe Map

If a power has naval units in a sea zone, he may spend
2 CP on the Initiate Piracy action and target any enemy
power that controls a port space adjacent to that sea zone.
In addition, if the Ottoman power has corsairs in a sea
zone, he may initiate piracy against an active major power even if
the two powers are not At War.

Europe Map Piracy Procedure

1. Declare Piracy: An active power declares that his naval units in
a sea zone are initiating piracy. A major power that controls one or
more port spaces connected to that sea zone must be specified as
the target for the piracy. Unless the Ottoman is initiating piracy with
corsairs, the active and target powers must be at war. Each power
may only initiate piracy in a given sea zone once per turn; place one
of this power’s “Piracy” markers in this zone as a reminder. Each
sea zone can be targeted for piracy by no more than two powers
per turn and each power is limited to three piracy actions per turn
(spread across all sea and ocean zones).
2. Targeted Player Adds Up Dice: The targeted power adds up the
number of dice they will roll in defense. They receive:
• 	2 dice for each naval unit (other than the armada) of the targeted
power in the sea zone where piracy is occurring (only possible
if the Ottoman is initiating piracy with corsairs).
• 	1 die for each naval unit (other than a corsair or the armada)
of the targeted power (or another power at war with the active
power) in a port or sea zone adjacent to the sea zone where
piracy is occurring.
• 	1 die for each fortress controlled by the targeted power (or
another power at war with the active power) adjacent to the sea
zone where piracy is occurring. This fortress must be adjacent
to the zone where piracy is occurring and may not be in unrest
or under siege. (NOTE: This die is for fortresses, not fortified
spaces, so keys do not give you these dice.)
• 	1 die if this is piracy by the Ottoman and the Knights of St. John
unit is in a port adjacent to the zone where piracy is occurring.
3. Roll Dice Against Pirates: The targeted power rolls the number
of dice computed above. Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is considered
to be a hit. Hits are applied as follows:
a) If the Ottoman initiated piracy with corsairs, start by eliminating 1 corsair for each hit.

4. Add Up Piracy Dice: If one or more naval units from the active
power remain in the sea zone after Step 3 (and at least one Ottoman
corsair remains if targeting a non-enemy power), the active power
will roll for piracy. That power receives base dice as follows:
• 	1 die: if there is only 1 naval unit of the active power in the
sea zone or only 1 port of the targeted power connected to the
zone
• 	2 dice: otherwise
The active power then adds the Piracy rating of any naval leader
present in the zone to get the final number of dice.
5. Roll Piracy Dice: The active player rolls this number of dice.
Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is considered to be a hit. For each hit
scored, the targeted power must choose to do one of the following:
a. Eliminate a naval unit in or adjacent to the targeted sea zone,
b. Allow the active power to draw at random and keep 1 card
from his hand (it cannot be played until a future impulse),
c. Award the active player 1 VP for Piracy, and
d. Downgrade the Spanish Armada by one level if Spain was
the piracy target and the Armada was in or adjacent to the sea
zone where piracy occurred.
The active player may not be awarded a card draw if no cards are
left to be drawn from the target power’s hand. The target power
must always try and award one of these four awards for each hit.
Picking an award of no benefit to the active player is not permitted if another selection is available. If more than one hit is scored
on the same piracy action, the target power must divide the hits as
equally as possible between valid awards (i.e., an award cannot be
chosen for a second time until all possible awards are granted at
least once).			

16.5 Piracy on the World Map

If a power has a sea captain in an ocean zone, he may
spend 2 CP on the Initiate Piracy action and target either
Spain or Portugal.

World Map Piracy Procedure

1. Declare Piracy: An active power declares that his sea captain
in an ocean zone is initiating piracy against Spain or Portugal. The
targeted power must control a settlement adjacent to that sea zone.
(Note: The settlement Nombre de Dios/Panama is connected to
both the Mexican Coast and the Spanish Main.) The sea captain’s
power need not be at war with Spain or Portugal to initiate this
piracy, and Portugal may be targeted at any time, even before the
event Death of King Sebastian has made them a full participant
in the game (or even if Portugal has entered the game and become
a Spanish ally). The only restriction is that England or France may
not pirate Portugal if currently allied with Portugal. Each power
may only initiate piracy in a given ocean zone once per turn; place
one of this power’s “Piracy” markers in this zone as a reminder.
Each ocean zone can be targeted for piracy by no more than two
powers per turn and each power is limited to three piracy actions
per turn (spread across all sea and ocean zones).

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

2. Targeted Player Adds Up Dice: The targeted power computes
the number of dice they will roll in defense:
• 	Portugal: If Portugal is the target, roll 1 die for each Portuguese
settlement adjacent to this ocean zone.
• 	Spain: If Spain is the target, roll 1 die for each patrol in the
ocean zone plus 1 die for each Spanish fortress in a settlement
directly connected to this ocean zone. If no such patrols or
fortresses are present, no dice are rolled.
3. Roll Dice Against Pirates: If the targeted power receives 1 or
more dice, he makes these rolls. Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is considered to be a hit. Two hits eliminate a sea captain from the game.
One hit also eliminates a sea captain if he was damaged when piracy
was initiated. If one hit is scored against an undamaged captain,
flip his counter to the Damaged side.
4. Sea Captain Adds Up Piracy Dice: If the sea captain remains
in the ocean zone after Step 3, the active power will roll for piracy.
That power receives base dice as follows:
• 	1 die: if the sea captain is damaged or only 1 settlement of the
targeted power is connected to the zone
• 	2 dice: otherwise
The active power then adds the Piracy rating of the sea captain to
these base dice to get the final number of dice.
5. Roll Piracy Dice: The active player rolls this number of dice.
Each roll of a “5” or a “6” is considered to be a hit. For each hit
scored, the Spanish player (even if Portugal is the target) must
choose to do one of the following:
a. Eliminate a patrol in the ocean zone
b. If Spain is the target, allow the active power to draw at random one of the Spanish treasures. If Spain rolled at least one
die for the presence of a fortress connected to this ocean zone,
the Spanish player chooses one treasure to withhold from the
pool available to this random draw.
c. If Portugal is the target, allow the active power to draw at
random one of the Portuguese treasures.
d. Award the active player 1 VP for Piracy.
The active player may not be awarded a treasure if the appropriate
row (Spanish or Portuguese) is empty (or if the piracy is against
Spain, a Spanish fortress is connected to the ocean zone, and there
is only 1 Spanish treasure left). The target power must always try
and award one of these options for each hit. Picking an award of no
benefit to the active player is not permitted if another selection is
available. If more than one hit is scored on the same piracy action,
Spain must divide the hits as equally as possible between valid
awards (i.e., an award cannot be chosen for a second time until all
possible awards are granted at least once).	
6. Store Loot: Treasures earned in Step 5 are placed underneath
the sea captain’s counter. Undamaged expeditions can carry two
treasures; damaged expeditions only carry one. If after receiving
treasures in Step 5 (and combining them with any treasures received
by the expedition during earlier piracy attempts) the total number
exceeds the storage capacity of the expedition, the owning player
chooses which excess treasures are discarded.
7. Possible Return Home: If a path of connected ocean zones can
be traced from the sea captain’s location to an ocean zone of entry
for their power, and that path does not cross a Hazardous Passage,
they may opt to return home immediately. If this option is chosen,
add any loot treasures to the power’s hand; place the sea captain

25

on the next turn of the Turn Track to signify that he may reenter
play at the start of the next turn. If the sea captain instead chooses
to remain at sea, he must wait until a future piracy attempt or the
Winter Phase to have another opportunity to return home.

16.6 Circumnavigation

Sea captains can circumnavigate the globe by moving around the
map in either direction. 2 VP are awarded to the first sea captain
to circumnavigate during the game; 1 VP is awarded the second
time it occurs. Immediately award the VP, add loot treasures to the
player’s hand, and remove the sea captain from the map if any of
these conditions are met (this is not optional):
•	 Ottoman: if a sea captain returns to the Indian Ocean zone
for the first time from the Guinea Coast after having initially
moved out of the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific.
•	 Ottoman: if a sea captain returns to the Indian Ocean zone
for the first time from the South Pacific after having initially
moved out of the Indian Ocean to the Guinea Coast.
•	 English, French, Protestant: if a sea captain moves into the
South Atlantic for the first time from the Chilean Coast and
this same captain has already sailed to the Indian Ocean from
the Guinea Coast.
•	 English, French, Protestant: if a sea captain moves into the
Guinea Coast for the first time from the Indian Ocean and this
same captain has already sailed to the Chilean Coast from the
South Atlantic.

16.7 Antwerp and Rotterdam

Antwerp and Rotterdam are special inland ports marked with a
unique dark blue port symbol. As inland ports, these cities possess a subset of the properties of a full port space. These special
properties are:
•	 Naval units prohibited: No naval unit may ever enter Antwerp
or Rotterdam.
•	 Naval transport: A power conducting a naval transport
through the North Sea may move units directly from Antwerp
or Rotterdam to the North Sea (or vice versa) for 1 CP if the
port connected to Antwerp or Rotterdam by inland waterway
(Flushing or Brielle) is also under control of the active power.
•	 Assault: An assault may not be conducted against Antwerp or
Rotterdam if the power besieged in the space also controls the
port connected to this space by inland waterway (Exception:
An assault may still be conducted if the assaulting power has
naval units in the North Sea zone or if the Treachery Event
card or Siege Engineering combat card is played).
•	 Piracy: Antwerp or Rotterdam may be the target of a piracy
attempt if the power initiating piracy also controls the port
connected to this space by inland waterway.
•	 Sea Beggars: Antwerp or Rotterdam may be the target of the
Sea Beggars event if the Protestant controls the port connected
to this space by inland waterway.
•	 Religion: Antwerp and Rotterdam are always connected to
the North Sea for the purpose of allowing religious conversion
across a sea zone (18.5) regardless of which power controls the
port connected by inland waterway.
See 2.5 for information on movement, interception, avoid battle,
and religious activity across an inland waterway connection leading
to Antwerp or Rotterdam.

17. CONSTRUCTION

Rules Manual

17.3 Naval Units

There are a number of actions which allow powers to construct new
land units, naval units, expeditions, or fortresses. New units must
be constructed in one of your power’s home space that is currently
under your control (Exceptions: The cards Foreign Volunteers
and Reiters allow units to be built in a non-home friendly space).
Units may never be constructed in a space in unrest.

17.1 Force Pools

The counters provided with the game for each power are purposely
limited to reflect the total manpower of these powers during the
period. Units may never be constructed in excess of the counters
available. Players may exchange different demoninations of counters at any time to facilitate new builds [EXAMPLE: If the player
has run out of “1” counters, he could still build in a space containing 3 units by replacing the units with a “4” counter.] Since naval
units for most powers are two-sided, players should consider carefully which type of naval unit they want to construct (e.g., a power
with galleys and galleons could diminish their chance of building
a galleon fleet if they construct too many galleys).
Knights of St. John: This counter is considered to
be a Spanish regular counter for all game purposes
except:
• it can never be built with a Build Regular action
and
•	 it may never be moved from its current space.
Depending on the scenario, it starts the game as either 1 or 2 units.
If all units are eliminated, the counter may only return to the map
through play of the Knights of St. John event.

17.2 Land Units

Land units may be constructed in any friendly home space that is
not occupied by enemy units. The only exceptions are:
(a) as marked by the red circles with a diagonal slash, the Ottoman player may not build land units in Algiers or Djerba/Tripoli,
(b) the Spanish player not build land units in Oran or Malta
(marked with the same symbol), and
(c) the only unit which the Spanish player may build in the
Netherlands Religious Struggle area are Walloons. The three
Walloon regular counters represent a special subset of the
Spanish force pool. They are treated as Spanish regulars for all
purposes. The only exception is in unit construction: they can
only be constructed in spaces in the Netherlands, and they are
the only Spanish units that can be constructed in the Netherlands.

Naval units may be constructed in any friendly home port that is not
occupied by enemy units. Naval units lost in combat or assault cannot
be rebuilt on the turn in which they were eliminated. When a naval
unit is lost place it on the next turn of the Turn Track. During the
Card Draw Phase (8.1) these eliminated naval units are returned to
the pool of units available to be constructed by that power. (Exception: If a power has earned the Dry Dock science bonus, he may
immediately rebuild lost naval units of his major power. Those units
immediately return to the power’s force pool when eliminated).
Galley: The Ottoman, Spain, France,
and Holy Roman may spend 2 CP on
the Build Galley action. Add 1 galley
to the map in any home port for each
such action taken. Galleys are the only
type of unit Spain can build at Oran. The Ottoman may not
construct galleys in Algiers or Djerba/Tripoli. Spain may not
build galleys in spaces in the Netherlands religious struggle area.
Corsair: The Ottoman power (only)
may spend 1 CP on the Build Corsair
action. Add 1 corsair to the map for
each such action taken. Corsairs may
be constructed in any Ottoman home
port including Algiers or Djerba/Tripoli.
Galleon: Spain, England, France and
the Protestant may spend 2 CP on the
Build Galleon action. Add 1 galleon to
a home port that connects to an Atlantic
sea zone for each such action taken. If
England is building a galleon in London on Turn 3 or later and
the sea captain Hawkins is in that space, place the galleon counter on the race-built side. (Alternatively, existing English galleons may be upgraded to their race-built side through the John
Hawkins event). Spain may not build galleons in spaces in the
Netherlands religious struggle area.
Patrol: Spain may spend 2 CP on the Build Patrol
action. Add 1 patrol to any ocean zone connected
to a settlement under Spanish control for each such
action taken.

17.4 Expeditions

The Ottoman, England, France, and the Protestant may spend 1 CP
on the Build Expedition action. Take a sea captain of your power
and add it to the map. There are three cases:
Ottoman sea captain, Suez Canal not built: Place the sea
captain in the Indian Ocean zone on its Damaged (back) side.

The Ottoman and Holy Roman players may also construct units on
a Foreign War card if one is in progress (23.7).

Ottoman sea captain, Suez Canal built: Place the sea captain
in the Indian Ocean zone on its Undamaged (front) side.

Regulars: All powers may spend 2 CP on the Raise Regular
Troop action. Add 1 regular unit to the map for each such action taken.

English, French, Holy Roman or Protestant sea captain: Place
the sea captain in the North Atlantic or Guinea Coast ocean zone
on its Undamaged (front) side. Sea captains with a split orange
and blue background can be built by either the French or Protestant (whoever sponsors their voyage first). Le Testu may not
be used if he has already been sponsored as a scientist this turn.

Mercenaries: All powers except the Ottoman may spend 1 CP
on the Buy Mercenary action. Add 1 mercenary unit to the map
for each such action taken.
Cavalry: The Ottoman power (only) may spend 1 CP on the
Raise Cavalry action. Add 1 cavalry unit to the map for each
such action taken.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

If one of these powers has a colony marker that is not
currently in play, they may spend an additional CP
(for a total cost of 2 CP) to add a colony to the expedition. (Exception: The Ottoman can only add a col-

Rules Manual

ony if the Suez Canal has been built). Place the colony on top of
the sea captain counter. The additional CP is waived if the power
has earned the Plantation science bonus. The rules for moving
expeditions on the World Map can be found in 16.1.

17.5 Fortresses

Any power may spend 2 CP on the Build Fortress
action. Fortresses may be constructed in any unfortified friendly home space on the Europe Map that is
not occupied by enemy units or an existing fortress
marker (and is not in unrest). When adding a fortress
to the Europe Map, take it from the general supply of markers.
Spain is also allowed to build fortresses on the World Map with the
Build Fortress action if a fortress marker is available on the Spanish
Power Card. Remove that marker from the Spanish Power Card
and place it on any World Map settlement controlled by Spain that
does not already contain a fortress.

18. RELIGIOUS STRUGGLES

The struggle for the religious hearts and minds of Europe started by
Martin Luther in 1517 continues throughout Virgin Queen, though it
is confined to four areas (2.5): Scotland, England, the Netherlands,
and France. The Spanish, English, Holy Roman and Protestant
players all earn (or lose) VP based on the outcome of this struggle.
The Spanish, French, and Protestant players can win Automatic
Victories if the religious struggle swings too far in one direction.
This section presents all the rules governing the religious conflict.
After one section on basic principles, the rules below cover the three
actions that arise from the religious fight (18.2 to 18.4). These are
followed by detailed procedures for resolving Protestant Conversion
attempts, Catholic Conversion attempts, and Rebellions.

18.1 Basic Principles
Terminology

Remember that the “religious influence” (Catholic or Protestant,
see 2.3) of each space in the four religious struggle areas is tracked
throughout the game and is not tied in any way to the political control of the space. With that in mind, here is some other terminology
important to the religious struggles.
Protestant Conversion Attempt: A Protestant Conversion attempt is a step within a religious action or event in which a power
tries to turn the religious influence of a space from Catholic to
Protestant. Although only England and the Protestant may initiate
Protestant Conversions with actions, any power may initiate conversions if they play an Event card that provides such attempts.
Catholic Conversion Attempt: A Catholic Conversion attempt
is a step within a religious action or event in which a power
tries to turn the religious influence of a space from Protestant to
Catholic. Although only Spain and France may initiate Catholic
Conversions with actions, any power may initiate conversions if
they play an Event card that provides such attempts.

Core Presence

27

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

During the course of the game, the religious influence of spaces in
each of the four religious struggle areas will swing back and forth
between Catholic and Protestant. However, under no circumstances
can any action or event ever remove the final Catholic space or the

final Protestant space from one of these areas. If resolution of an
event or action would normally cause this final space to change
influence, this flip is dropped. Events and actions may not be initiated that generate conversion attempts if no spaces may be flipped
by those attempts due to this core presence rule. A space in unrest
can be counted as the final space of a particular religion in an area.

18.2 Preaching Sermons

Spain or the Protestant may spend 2 CP on the Preach Sermon action. If Spain undertakes the action, it results in 5 Catholic Conversion attempts in England. If the Protestant undertakes the action,
he can choose to take 5 Protestant Conversion attempts in France,
the Netherlands or Scotland (but he may not make attempts in more
than one area). Protestant and Catholic Conversion attempts are
resolved as per 18.5.

18.3 Suppress Heresy

Spain, England, or France may spend 2 CP on the Suppress Heresy action. If Spain undertakes the action, it results in 5 Catholic
Conversion attempts in the Netherlands. If England undertakes the
action, it results in 5 Protestant Conversion attempts in England.
Finally if France undertakes the action, it results in 5 Catholic
Conversion attempts in either France or Scotland (but France may
not make attempts in more than one area). Protestant and Catholic
Conversion attempts are resolved as per 18.5.

18.4 Rebellions

The Protestant may spend from 2 to 5 CP on the Rebellion action to
switch spaces in France or the Netherlands with Protestant religious
influence to Protestant political control. The action may add Huguenot or Dutch units to some of those spaces and place the Protestant
at war with France or Spain. Spain may start rebellions in England
through the English Catholic Rebellion espionage action (19.4) or
the Rising of the North event but does not have a Rebellion action
available like the Protestant. The detailed procedure for rebellions
can be found in 18.5.

Restrictions:

•	 If two Rebellions are initiated in the same impulse they must
target different religious struggle areas.
•	 Rebellions are not possible in Scotland.
•	 Rebellions may not be started in France if the Protestant is
currently allied with France.
•	 A rebellion may not be started if there is no valid target space
(see Rebellion Procedure, Step 1 in 18.5).

18.5 Religious Procedures

Protestant Conversion Conditions

Units and Religion

The presence of land and naval units may affect whether or not Reformation and Counter Reformation attempts can possibly succeed
or are automatically successful. These effects are applied based on
the religious affiliation of the units, as shown below:

Protestant units are:
•	
•	
•	
•	

English regulars and naval units
Dutch regulars and naval units
Huguenot regulars and naval units
Scottish regulars

a) The space is in the religious struggle area(s) being targeted
by this action or event.
b) The space is adjacent to a space under Protestant religious
influence (even if across a pass) or is a port connected to a sea
zone that contains other ports under Protestant religious influence. The adjacent space or port may not be in unrest and must
have been Protestant at the start of this step of the procedure.
c) The target space does not contain a Catholic unit or a Jesuit.
6.	Allocate Remaining Conversions: Any die that is currently
showing a “4” or a “5” is a minor conversion. For each minor conversion flip a space to Protestant religious influence that meets all
three Protestant conversion conditions. Each roll of “6” saved in Step
5 is a major conversion. For each major conversion flip a space to
Protestant religious influence that meets the first two conversion conditions. You may ignore the third condition with major conversions,
allowing you to flip spaces with Catholic units or Jesuits present.

Catholic units are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Rules Manual

Spanish regulars and naval units
French regulars and naval units
Irish regulars
Papal regulars and naval units
Portuguese regulars and naval units
Venetian regulars and naval units
Walloon regulars

7.	Add Unrest: Add each Unrest marker taken in Step 4 to the
map. The space is chosen by the power taking the conversion attempts. It must be a space converted during this action or event.
Skip placing excess markers if you have more Unrest markers than
spaces converted.

Unaligned units are:

•	 Ottoman regulars, cavalry, and naval units
•	 Holy Roman regulars
•	 Mercenaries of any power

Protestant Conversion Attempt Procedure

All Protestant Conversion attempts resulting from a single action or
event are resolved together, using the following procedure.
1.	Roll Dice: Roll one die for each conversion attempt generated by
this action or event. (Note that the first die is not rolled randomly
for conversions from the events Calvinist Zeal, Belgic Confession
and Huguenot Lent; instead that die is automatically placed down
as a “6”.)
2.	Adjust Dice: If these conversion attempts are generated by Belgic Confession, change all rolls from Step 1 of “3” to “4”. If these
conversion attempts are generated by Iconoclastic Fury, change
all rolls of “5” to “6”.
3.	Drop Misses: Rolls of “2” and “3” are misses. These dice may
be ignored for the rest of this procedure.
4.	Take Unrest Markers: If a “1” was rolled on any of the dice in
Step 1, one space of unrest will be generated by these conversion
attempts. Take one Unrest marker at this time; the unrest will be
placed in Step 7. (If these attempts generated by Iconoclastic Fury,
take one Unrest marker for each roll of “1”). You may nullify one
Unrest marker if you are willing to reduce a roll of “6” to a “5”.
5.	Allocate Major Conversions: Any die that is currently showing
a “6” is a major conversion. For each major conversion you may
either:
•	 Save the die for Step 6 so it can convert a space under a Catholic
unit or Jesuit, or
•	 Flip a space to Protestant religious influence to enlarge your
“base area” before additional conversions occur in Step 6.
Spaces flipped must meet all three Protestant conversion conditions shown in the following box.

EXAMPLE: It is the first Protestant impulse of the Tournament
Scenario. No units or control markers have changed position from
the opening setup. The Protestant player plays the card Huguenot
Lent for the event: “Take 8 Protestant conversion attempts that
can affect spaces in France. The first die is automatically a “6”;
the rest are rolled randomly.”
STEP 1: The Protestant player starts by placing one die down
on the table on its “6” side and then takes seven more dice into
his hand and rolls them. (He does not need to make any decision
about where in France he would like to make conversions until
after the dice have been rolled.) The rolls are 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
plus the 6 that was placed down.
STEP 2: Skipped (this is not one of the two events mentioned
in this step).
STEP 3: The two dice with a “2” or “3” are removed from the
table since these misses are ignored.
STEP 4: Just one Unrest marker is picked up by the Protestant
for placement in Step 7 (even though more than one roll of “1”
occurred).
STEP 5: The Protestant has 2 major conversions to allocate,
one for each of the dice showing a “6”. He decides he wants to
convert Paris, so he decides to save one die for Step 6 (that will
be used on Paris) and use the other to enlarge his “base area”
toward Paris. Orleans is flipped to Protestant religious influence.
STEP 6: The “6” that was saved in Step 5 is used to flip Paris
to Protestant religious influence. The Protestant has two minor
conversions that can flip spaces without a Catholic unit: he
chooses to convert Bourges and Dijon.
STEP 7: The Unrest marker must now be placed in Orleans,
Paris, Bourges or Dijon since those are the spaces that have
been converted. Paris is selected for the unrest, forcing the
French player to also put an Unrest marker on his Power Card
to indicate that one of his keys is in unrest.

all three Catholic conversion conditions. Each roll of “6” saved in
Step 5 is a major conversion. For each major conversion flip a space
to Catholic religious influence that meets the first two conversion
conditions. You may ignore the third condition with major conversions, allowing you to flip spaces with Protestant units present.

The map now looks like this:

6.	Add Unrest: Add each Unrest marker taken in Step 3 to the
map. The space is chosen by the power taking the conversion attempts. It must be a space converted during this action or event.
Skip placing excess markers if you have more Unrest markers than
spaces converted.

Rebellion Procedure

1. Specify Target Space and CP Spent: Choose the target space
and the number of CP to spend on this rebellion action (for rebellion
actions this is from 2 to 5 CP). Spending additional CP provides
more dice in the rebellion, allows more spaces to come under Protestant control, and places more regulars into the target space if the
rebellion succeeds. The target space must meet these requirements:

Catholic Conversion Attempt Procedure

All Catholic Conversion attempts resulting from a single action or
event are resolved together, using the following procedure:
1.	Roll Dice: Roll one die for each conversion attempt generated by
this action or event. (Note that the first die is not rolled randomly
for the events Council of Troubles, Index of Prohibited Books,
Tridentine Catechism, and English Recusants; instead that die is
automatically placed down as a “6”.)
2.	Drop Misses: Rolls of “2” and “3” are misses. These dice may
be ignored for the rest of this procedure.
3.	Take Unrest Markers: If a “1” was rolled on any of the dice in
Step 1, one space of unrest will be generated by these conversion
attempts. Take one Unrest marker at this time; the unrest will be
placed in Step 6. You may nullify one Unrest marker if you are
willing to reduce a roll of “6” to a “5”.
4.	Allocate Major Conversions: Any die that is currently showing
a “6” is a major conversion. For each major conversion you may
either:
•	 Save the die for Step 6 so it can convert a space under a Protestant unit, or
•	 Flip a space to Catholic religious influence to enlarge your “base
area” before additional conversions occur in Step 5. Spaces
flipped must meet all three Catholic conversion conditions
shown in the box below.

Catholic Conversion Conditions
a) The space is in the religious struggle area(s) being targeted
by this action or event.
b) The space is adjacent to a space under Catholic religious influence (even if across a pass) or is a port connected to a sea zone
that contains other ports under Catholic religious influence. The
adjacent space or port may not be in unrest and must have been
Catholic at the start of this step of the procedure.
c) The target space does not contain a Protestant unit.
5.	Allocate Remaining Conversions: Any die that is currently
showing a “4” or a “5” is a minor conversion. For each minor
conversion flip a space to Catholic religious influence that meets

•	 It must be in France or the Netherlands.
•	 It must be under French political control (if the space is in
France) or Spanish political control (if the space is in the
Netherlands.
•	 It must be under Protestant religious influence.
•	 The space may not be currently under siege (but it may be in
unrest).
2. Resolve Rebellion: If there were no Catholic units in the target
space the rebellion is automatically successful; skip to Step 3. Otherwise roll dice to see if the rebellion can eliminate all the Catholic
units in the target space. Roll one die for each CP spent plus one
additional die if the target is a Protestant home space. Each roll of
a “5” or a “6” is considered to be a hit. The power controlling the
space eliminates one Catholic unit under his control from the space
for each hit scored (remember that Catholic units are either regulars
or naval units but not mercenaries). If after these losses are applied
one or more Catholic units under that power’s control remain, the
rebellion fails. Skip the rest of this procedure.
3. Displace Units: Any leaders and non-Catholic units in the target
space are displaced (12.5). Catholic units in the target space that
are controlled by a power other than the space’s owner are also
displaced.
4. Control Spaces: Switch the political control of the target space to
Protestant political control. Additional spaces adjacent to the target
space and in the same religious struggle area may also be switched
to Protestant political control if they are both under Protestant
religious influence and free of Catholic units. However the total
number of spaces flipped in this step may never exceed the number
of CP spent on this action. Any units that are in these spaces and
are not controlled by the Protestant are displaced.
5. Receive Regulars: If the rebellion is in France, add 1 Huguenot
regular to the target space for every 2 full CP spent. If the rebellion
is in the Netherlands, add 1 Dutch regular to the target space for
every 2 full CP spent. The number of regulars received is limited
by the Protestant counter mix.
6. Update War State: If this rebellion is in France and the Protestant is not currently at war with France, add an At War marker to
the box for these powers on the Diplomatic Status Display. If this
rebellion is in the Netherlands and the Protestant is not currently
at with Spain, add an At War marker to the box for these powers
on the Diplomatic Status Display.

7. Add Protestant Capital: If the Protestant does not have a capital
designated for this religious struggle area (and his capital is not on
the Turn Track due to capture earlier this turn), he may add one to the
map at this time (23.6). The space chosen must be under Protestant
political control and must be a fortified space (but it does not have
to be a key). It does not have to be the target space chosen in Step
1. Add a capital marker to the space.

Rules Manual

At the end of the Rebellion the map now looks like this:

8. Add Military Leader: If there is a Protestant military leader for
this religious struggle area available to enter play, the Protestant
may add that leader to the target space chosen in Step 1.
EXAMPLE: It is the Protestant impulse and eastern France
looks like this:

19. ESPIONAGE

Starting on Turn 3, the Wars of Religion take on a nastier character,
allowing all of the powers to initiate Espionage-related actions.
(None of the actions mentioned in this rules section can be utilized
on Turn 1 or 2.) Each power receives 4 new markers into his force
pool at the start of Turn 3:
•	 Two “Informant” markers
•	 One “Assassination Used” marker
•	 One “Cipher Key” marker (use is described on the Event card
Cipher Key)

The Protestant player plays a card for 3 CP.
STEP 1: The Protestant chooses Lyon as the target space and
allocates all 3 CP to this rebellion.
STEP 2: Lyon is not a Huguenot home space, so only three dice
are rolled. The Protestant rolls 1, 2, 5, good enough for one hit.
The only Catholic unit present is the French regular, so it is
eliminated. The rebellion succeeds since all Catholic units have
been eliminated.
STEP 3: The two French mercenaries are displaced (to the closest
French-controlled fortified space or Paris, the French capital).
Orleans is chosen.
STEP 4: The Huguenot gains control of Lyon and up to 3 more
adjacent spaces under Protestant religious influence in France.
Huguenot control markers on their Protestant religious influence
side are placed on Dijon and Clermont.
STEP 5: One Huguenot regular is placed in Lyon.
STEP 6: France and the Protestant are now At War (if not
already).
STEP 7: If the Huguenot capital was off-map, it could be placed
in Lyon. However the capital is already in La Rochelle, so this
step is ignored.
STEP 8: If the Huguenot had a military leader available to enter
it could be placed in Lyon. However both Coligny and Navarre
are already on the map, so this step is ignored.

These markers are used to show the allocation of intelligence assets
by that power, as described in the sections below.

19.1 Gain Intelligence

Any power may spend 2 CP on the Gain Intelligence action. The
active player rolls the number of attack dice indicated on the Gain
Intelligence column of the Espionage table (base of two dice plus
bonus dice if indicated). Hits are scored on rolls of “5” and “6”.
Consult the bottom of the Gain Intelligence column to determine the
result of the intelligence operation. If an Informant is neutralized,
flip his counter to the reverse side. This Informant is returned to its
owning power during the Winter Phase. If a Jesuit is neutralized,
remove the Jesuit marker from the map; he may reenter play during a future Card Draw Phase if Spain has a Jesuit box available
on his power card.

19.2 Plant Operative

Any power may spend 2 CP to add an operative to play. When an Informant is
added, its counter is placed in the “Informants Spying on You” box on the power
card of the intended target. You may add an Informant
with this action if you have a non-neutralized Informant in your
force pool or one that you are willing to move off one power card
and onto another. You may not add an Informant if you already
have one on the target’s power card (whether that existing Informant
is neutralized or not). When an Informant is spying, espionage
activities initiated against the target power receive additional dice.

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Spain may also use this action to add a Jesuit to the map if any
remain on the Spanish Power Card. Remove the Jesuit marker from
the power card and add it to any space in England (no more than
one per space). A Jesuit helps promote the Catholic cause (18.5 and
19.4). Jesuits may not be placed in any other Religious Struggle area
besides England and they may only move when the God’s Secret
Agents card is played as an event.

19.3 Assassination

Each power may, once per turn, spend from 2 to 4 CP on
the Assassination action to try to remove a named army
leader (or Elizabeth I) from play. Leaders must be serving as an army leader and on the map to be chosen as a
target for assassination (i.e., Protestant army leaders held off-map,
captured army leaders, default army leaders, and Don John while
serving as a naval leader are not eligible). Spending more CP allows
the active player to roll more dice (increasing his chance of success).
The active player rolls the number of attack dice indicated on the
Assassination column of the Espionage table. Then compute the
dice rolled by the defending player in the same fashion. Each side
rolls their dice; hits are scored on rolls of “5” and “6”. Consult the
bottom of the Assassination column to determine the result. If the
target is killed, the assassinating power earns 1 VP. After resolving
the action, place the active power’s “Assassination Used” marker
on the Turn Track to serve as a reminder that this power cannot make
another assassination attempt until the next turn.

19.4 English Catholic Rebellion

Once per turn, Spain may spend from 3 to 5 CP on the English
Catholic Rebellion action (assuming it has not already initiated an
assassination this turn; place Spain’s “Assassination Used” marker
on the Turn Track when taking this action). Spending more CP allows the active player to roll more dice (increasing his chance of
success). The Spanish player rolls the number of attack dice indicated on the English Catholic Rebellion column of the Espionage
table. Then compute the dice rolled by England in the same fashion.
Each side rolls their dice; hits are scored on rolls of “5” and “6”.
Consult the bottom of the English Catholic Rebellion column to
determine the result. A result of “6 Catholic Conversions followed
by 4 CP Rebellion in England” is resolved as follows:
1. Take Catholic Conversions: The Spanish player takes 6 Catholic
Conversions that can affect spaces in England (18.5).

4. Displace Units: Any non-Protestant units in the target space
are displaced (12.5). Protestant units in the target space that are
controlled by a power other than England are also displaced.
5. Control Spaces: Switch the political control of the target space
to Spanish political control. Additional spaces adjacent to the target
space may also be switched to Spanish political control if they are
both under Catholic religious influence and free of Protestant units.
However the total number of spaces flipped in this step may never
exceed 4. Any units that are in these spaces that are not controlled
by Spain are displaced.
6. Receive Regulars: Add 2 Spanish regulars to the target space if
permitted by the Spanish counter mix.
7. Update War State: Add an At War marker to the box for Spain
and England on the Diplomatic Status Display (if not there already).

20. WINTER

The fifth phase of each turn is the Winter Phase, which starts immediately after the last impulse of the Action Rounds. During this
phase, all players complete the following actions in this order:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Spread unrest near Morisco unit
Discard unused treasures
Remove loaned naval unit markers
Return naval units to the nearest port
Return leaders and units to fortified spaces (suffering attrition
if there is no clear path to such a space)
Remove major power alliance markers
Add 1 regular to each friendly-controlled capital (or mercenaries if desired by the Holy Roman player)
Remove all piracy markers
Return Treasures from the New World
Reset espionage markers
Reset diplomatic status
Check for formation of the Catholic League

Each of these Winter Phase actions may be undertaken simultaneously by all players to speed play.

20.1 Spread Morisco Unrest

If the Morisco unit is in play, the Ottoman player
places Unrest markers on 2 unoccupied spaces
within 2 spaces of this unit.

2. Specify Target Space: Choose the target space which must meet
these requirements:
•	
•	
•	
•	

It must be in England
It must be under English political control
It must under Catholic religious influence
The space may not be currently under siege or in unrest

3. Resolve Rebellion: If there are no Protestant units in the target
space the rebellion is automatically successful; skip to Step 4.
Otherwise roll dice to see if the rebellion can eliminate all the
Protestant units in the target space. Roll 5 dice. Each roll of a “5”
or a “6” is considered to be a hit. England eliminates one Protestant
unit under his control from the space for each hit scored (remember
that Protestant units are either regulars or naval units but not mercenaries). If after these losses are applied one or more Protestant
units under English control remain, the rebellion fails. Skip the
rest of this procedure.

31

20.2 Discard Unused Treasures

Discard any treasures still remaining in a player’s hand (that he
was not able to spend during the Action Phase).

20.3 Loaned Naval Unit Markers

Remove all Loaned markers from naval units. These fleets will
return to a port controlled by their owning power in the following step, not to a port controlled by the power to which they have
been on loan.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

20.4 Returning Home

Naval units are now returned to ports as described below. Immediately after naval units have been moved to ports, all land units are
moved to fortified spaces.

Naval Units Returning Home

Naval units must be placed in the nearest port controlled by their
major power. If more than one port is the same distance away, the
owning player selects any of these equidistant ports (splitting a stack
between several ports if desired). Naval units returning home at this
time cannot be intercepted, do not fight naval combat if moving
through enemy units, never suffer any attrition, and may return to
a port that was under siege at the start of the phase. Naval leaders
in a sea zone must return to a port with one of the units that started
this phase in the same sea zone. The one exception is Don John
who also has the option to switch into an Army Leader and return
to either Spanish capital.

Land Units Returning Home

Land units in either unfortified spaces or fortified spaces not controlled by their major power must return to a fortified space that
is controlled by their power (with a limit of 4 per space except
capitals). Land units already in fortified spaces controlled by their
power have the option of returning to their home capital. Land units
already in their home capital are the only ones that are prohibited
from moving during this phase (all other land units at least have
the option to be moved at this time). Land units move according
to the procedure listed below. All land units moving between the
same two spaces are moved as a stack. Check for an open path of
any length of adjacent land spaces or sea zones from the stack’s current location to its destination. To avoid losing units to attrition, all
spaces on the path (except the space where the path begins) must be:
•	 Friendly-controlled
•	 Free of unrest.
Note that unlike the determination of LOC (Section 12.1), enemy
units are ignored at this time. In addition, paths may be traced over
any number of sea zones without a friendly naval unit being present
in the sea zone. Because alliances are in effect until the end of the
next step of the Winter Phase, land units may trace a path through
spaces controlled by allied powers. If no such path exists, the stack
takes attrition, losing half of its units (round up). The owning power
chooses which units are lost to attrition.

Land Unit Return Home Procedure

Each power performs the following steps to check the status of all
of its land units. This procedure may be performed simultaneously
for all powers.
1. Check Stacking Violations: Review all land units that are
stacked in fortified spaces controlled by their power (other than
their home capital). For each such fortified space that contains more
than 4 units, the power must return the excess units to their capital
(minor power units could also optionally return to a minor power
home key). Other land units in these spaces also have the option
of returning to their home capital (or minor key for minor power
units) if desired, even if not overstacked. The stack takes attrition
(see above) if its path must cross or end on a space in unrest or not
under friendly control.

Rules Manual

2. Return Units: Now review all land units in unfortified spaces
and in fortified spaces not controlled by their major power. These
units must either:
•	 Return to their home capital (or minor power key for minor
power units), or
•	 Return to the nearest fortified space controlled by their power
(but not if that would put more than 4 land units in that space).
The nearest space is always computed using a direct path to
the destination without regard to which power controls any of
the intervening spaces.
The player may split a stack at this time, choosing to move some
units to the nearest fortified space and returning the rest to the
home capital (or minor power key). If more than 1 fortified space
is “nearest” (i.e., they are equidistant from the stack’s current location), the player may move units to each of these spaces, as long as
the limit of 4 land units is observed. Any stack moving during this
phase takes attrition (see above) if its path must cross or end on a
space in unrest or not under friendly control.
3. Return Army Leaders: If a space containing an army leader
is vacated during this procedure, that army leader must either accompany one of the land units leaving the space throughout the
entire winter move or return to the power’s capital.

There are three exceptions to the rules in this procedure:

1. ENEMY-CONTROLLED CAPITAL: If a power’s capital
is currently controlled by an enemy power, none of its land units
may be returned to the capital. All units that would normally
have been required to return to the capital are eliminated instead.
2. SPANISH UNITS: Since the Spanish player has two home
capitals, his units may return to either during the Land Unit
Return Home Procedure.
3. HUGUENOT/DUTCH UNITS: Although the Protestant
player may have two capitals, his units must return to either the
Huguenot capital or the Dutch capital, depending on their type
(Huguenot or Dutch). See 23.6 for details.

Sea Captains Returning Home

Sea captains on the Europe Map are placed back in a power’s force
pool; they may reenter play during Spring Deployment or a Build
Expedition action on a future turn.
Sea captains on the World Map are returned to either one of their
power’s colonies or their ocean zone of entry onto the map (Indian Ocean for Ottoman sea captains; either the North Atlantic or
Guinea Coast for sea captains from other powers). You may only
return a captain to a colony or entry zone if he can trace a path of
ocean zones from his current location to this destination that does
not cross any Hazardous Passages. If a captain returns to an entry
zone, take him off of the map and add any treasures accumulated
by the expedition to the owning player’s hand; he may reenter play
on a future turn. Any colony marker he may have been carrying is
also available starting next turn. If a captain cannot reach a colony
or entry zone without crossing a Hazardous Passage, he remains in
his current ocean zone but must immediately roll another Navigation Check (16.1).

20.5 Major Power Alliance Markers

20.10 Catholic League Formation

20.6 Replacements

Checking for Formation

Remove all Allied markers between Major Powers from
the Diplomatic Status Display. All alliances declared for
this turn during the Diplomacy Phase are over; all alliances with minor powers created through play of Event
cards remain in effect.

Each power now adds 1 regular to its capital if it is
under friendly control and not in unrest. Spain and the
Protestant check both of their capitals and can receive a
regular at each capital if that space is both controlled
and not in unrest. The one exception is the Holy Roman who can
choose two alternatives to receiving the regular in his capital. The
other options are to either (a) add 2 Holy Roman mercenaries to
his capital, or (b) move the Mercenaries for Hire marker on his
power card from the “0” space to the “4” space. This final option
may be chosen even if the Holy Roman capital is controlled by
another power; this choice provides the Holy Roman player the
maximum diplomatic collateral for making deals in the upcoming
turn.

20.7 Piracy Markers/Treasures

Remove all piracy markers from the map at this time.
Then, all treasures still on the Spanish row of treasures
are added to the Spanish hand. If Portugal has entered
play, one random treasure from those remaining on the
Portuguese row is awarded to the major power that controls Lisbon
(if any).

20.8 Espionage Reset

Neutralized Informants: Return all neutralized Informants to
their owner’s force pool and flip them over to their front (nonneutralized side).
Assassination Attempts: Return all “Assassination Used” markers
on the Turn Track to their owners.
Walsingham: If the Walsingham marker is in the “Offensive” or
“Defensive” box, reset it to the “Unused” box.

20.9 Diplomacy Reset

All influence markers in a “Resolved this turn” box on
the Diplomatic Influence Table are reset to their default
values. Default values are shown by the muted colored
boxes that match the colors of each power’s control
markers. If no colored box exists for a power, this power’s marker
is placed in the “0” box.

33

At the end of the Winter Phase of Turns 3 through 6, players must
check and see if the Huguenot position in France is strong enough
to warrant formation of the Catholic League (a reactionary group
led by Henry of Guise and backed by Spain whose goal was to
drive the Huguenots from France). Once the Catholic League has
formed, skip this step in all subsequent Winter Phases.
Formation is automatic if the Protestant player controls 3 keys
in France. If the Protestant has less than 3 keys and 5 or fewer
French home spaces (including any keys) under political control,
the Catholic League is not formed; check again next turn. In all
other cases, roll 1 die and add the number rolled to the number of
French home spaces under Protestant political control. If the sum
is 12 or higher, the Catholic League is formed.

Catholic League Formation Procedure
Follow these steps after the league is formed:

1. Choose Catholic League Spaces: The Spanish player chooses
Reims and 2 other unfortified French home spaces that are not
Huguenot home spaces (i.e., solid blue spaces). These spaces
are immediately placed under Spanish political control and are
set to Catholic religious influence (if not already). If a fortress
has been built in Reims, any units there are displaced (12.5).
2. Reduce French Forces: Count the number of French regulars
on the board and divide by 3 (rounding up). The French player
must remove that many regulars from the map. Repeat this procedure for French mercenaries.
3. Add Spanish Units: The Spanish player now adds the same
number of Spanish regulars and mercenaries as the French player
eliminated to the Reims space. Place a fortress and the Duke of
Guise army leader in this space as well. If the Spanish player
did not receive at least 4 regulars in this step, boost the number
of regulars received so there are exactly 4 in Reims.
4. War Status: Spain is now placed At War with both France
and the Protestant. Although Spain may talk to both these players during the upcoming Diplomacy Segment of the following
turn, no deals may be announced between these two players
and Spain (effectively ensuring a state of war for at least one
turn). This restriction on announcements is lifted after this one
Diplomacy Segment.

The Duke of Guise may not move, intercept, retreat,
or avoid battle if it would cause him to leave the French
religious struggle area. If the rules for the return of
army leaders in winter would force the Duke of Guise
to leave the French religious struggle area, he is
eliminated from the game instead. For the purpose of this rule the
French religious struggle area also includes Metz.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

21. MARRIAGE

Rules Manual

Marriage Bonuses

All powers except the Ottoman have a
pool of male and female royal princes
and princesses for whom weddings can
be arranged. Each Royal is represented
by both a square counter and a two-sided
card. Use the counter on the Available to Wed chart to track that
royal’s current Eligibility Rating. The card provides information
on that royals’ Marriage Bonus and should be used as an aide when
arranging a marriage for that royal during the Negotiation Segment.
During the Marriage Resolution Phase, the royal couples that agreed
to marry during this turn’s Diplomacy Phase see how well their
union has worked out. This same procedure is also used to resolve
a marriage with Mary Queen of Scots during the Diplomacy Phase
(since her marriages are resolved immediately upon betrothal).

21.1 Resolving Marriages

To resolve a marriage, each power rolls one die and adds the current eligibility rating of their royal that was wed. If both royals are
from the same power, only the higher of the two eligibility ratings
is used. Add 2 more to the French royal’s roll if the Wedding Festivities marker has been added to the wedding. The bride’s sum
is then added to the groom’s sum to arrive at a final total for the
marriage; use this total to look up the result of the wedding on the
Royal Wedding Table. Remove both royals from play (Exception:
Royals are not removed if their result is “Last Minute Cancellation;” similarly William of Orange is only removed if he achieves
a result that earns VP for the Protestant). Instead of removing a
Valois royal from play, place him/her on the French power card to
mark the 1 Bonus VP earned.

Explanation of Royal Wedding Table Results

Results on the Royal Wedding table can include VP awards and
changes to the cards received on the next turn (+1 or –1). These
results apply to all powers involved in the wedding, even the Holy
Roman in a 4 or 5-player game. There are three results with additional implications:
•	 Back in pool; no bonuses: The marriage is cancelled as if it
was never agreed upon in the first place. Both royals may marry
in a future turn (though they must undergo Aging later in this
phase).
•	 Wife dies (in childbirth): This result does not affect award
of any bonuses. If the female royal was Mary Queen of Scots,
she is removed from the game as if executed (but with no VP
impact). If the female royal was Elizabeth I, apply the effects
listed in 23.3.
•	 Husband murdered: This result does not affect award of
any bonuses. If the husband was Philip II, Charles IX, Henry
III, or Rudolf II, apply the effects listed in Section 23. If the
husband was an army leader, remove him from the game (and
add a default leader to the Turn Track if he was the only army
leader for this power).

All royals in the game have a special attribute that affects the game
when they marry (assuming that their marriage result was not “Last
Minute Cancellation.”)
The following bonuses affect the resolution of the marriage:
•	 Reroll highest die (Don Carlos)
•	 Reroll lowest die if desired (Anna of Austria)
These bonuses result in actions that are taken by a power immediately after that royal’s marriage is resolved:
•	 Add influence (Lord Darnley; Mary Queen of Scots)
•	 Suppress Heresy (Elisabeth of Austria)
•	 Preach Sermon (Earl of Arran)
These bonuses specify that a marker is added to play that affects
the upcoming turns:
•	 +1/–1 card maker (Anna of Saxony; Charles II; Louise de
Coligny; Henry of Navarre; Philip II if he does not marry
Elisabeth de Valois on Turn 1, applies to the Campaign scenario
only)
•	 +1 patronage rolls (Isabella Eugenia)
•	 Loss of patronage Home Card bonus (Rudolf II)
These bonuses award VP:
•	 +1 VP per turn for not marrying (Elizabeth I)
•	 +1 VP for each marriage (all Valois royals)
Finally, there is a set of special bonuses:
•	 Leicester’s bonus affects the Aging process (21.3),
•	 William of Orange’s bonus may allow him to return to play
next turn as a 2 eligibility royal if his current marriage did not
score VP for the Protestant.

21.2 Virgin Queen VP

If Elizabeth I of England is still unmarried and on the
Available to Wed display, award 1 Virgin Queen Bonus
VP to the English player. Up to 5 such VP can be earned
during the game.

21.3 Aging

Each turn the unmarried royals age (and become less desirable
for marriage in future turns). After resolving marriages, move all
unmarried female royals down one eligibility rating on the Available to Wed display. Time is not quite as unkind to male royals;
they each get a chance to preserve their good looks by rolling a
single die. On a result of 5 or 6 their eligibility rating is unchanged
(otherwise it drops by 1).

21.4 Death of Betrothed Royal

Six royals may die between the time they agree to marry during the
Diplomacy Phase and the time to check the success of that endeavor
during the Marriage Resolution Phase (Charles IX and Leicester
may die due to Mandatory Events; Elizabeth I, Henry III, Henry
Navarre and William of Orange may die from assassination). In
this situation the marriage is ended just as if the “Back in pool; no
bonuses” result occurred, though the royal that died is of course
removed from play.

22. PATRONAGE

35

22.2 Scientists

Each player may sponsor one artist and one scientist per turn. During the Patronage Phase, players check to see if they have earned
VP or science bonuses from their work.

22.1 Artists

Each power may, once per turn,
spend from 2 to 4 CP on the Patronize Artist action. After choosing the number of CP to spend,
select an artist at random from those available to you this turn, even
if that includes artists of different types (writer, painter or architect).
Place the artist chosen in the appropriate box on the Arts side of
the Patronage table based on the number of CP spent on this action.
This artist’s work will be evaluated at the end of the turn. A power
may not undertake this action if it has no artists currently available.
An artist sponsored by the events Papal Bull, Patron of the Arts
or Commissioned from Italy does count as the one artist allowed
per power per turn. Artists from Italy may only be sponsored if one
of these three events is played, never from just spending CP on the
Patronize Artist action.

Evaluation

During the Patronage phase, players evaluate the work of each artist
sponsored during the turn. To evaluate an artist, roll 2 dice and add
the artist’s rating and any modifiers from CP spent, the Holy Roman’s “Prague Cultural Center” marker, or from being married to
Isabella Clara Eugenia. Proceed through the artists sponsored this
turn from highest rating printed on his counter to lowest rating (if
tied the artist from the power earliest in Impulse Order goes first).
If the result is:
6 or less: No victory points are earned and this artist is finished
for the game. Remove his counter from play.
7 or 8: This artist did not achieve anything of note this turn.
Remove the artist from play if he has a 1 rating; otherwise return him to the pool of available artists (so he may be used for
a Patronize Artist action in a future turn).
9: This artist did not achieve anything of note this turn; return
him to the pool of available artists.
10 or higher: If available, VP are earned by this artist (who is
finished for the game). The VP prizes earned by artists are limited by the VP markers still in play and the artist’s type (writer,
painter, or architect). An artist may only claim a 2 or 3 VP award
if they both achieved a result high enough for that award and
there is a marker available that matches the artist’s type. If there
are no available markers equal to the VP award achieved by the
artist, he must settle for the best available VP marker that does
not exceed the VP award specified by the patronage table. Note
that the 1 VP Artist markers may be claimed by artists of any
of the three types. If no VP marker can be claimed by this roll,
return the artist to the pool of available artists.

Each power may, once per turn, spend from 2 to 4 CP
on the Patronize Scientist action. After choosing the
number of CP to spend, select a scientist at random from
those available to you this turn. Place the scientist chosen in the appropriate box on the Science side of the Patronage
table based on the number of CP spent on this action. This scientist’s
work will be evaluated at the end of the turn. A power may not
undertake this action if it has no scientists currently available. A
scientist sponsored by the event Papal Bull, Patron of the Arts
or Commissioned from Italy does count as the one scientist allowed
per power per turn. Scientists from Italy may only be sponsored if
one of these three events is played, never from just spending CP
on the Patronize Scientist action. If no VP marker or bonus can be
claimed by this roll, return the scientist to the pool of available
scientists.

Evaluation

During the Patronage phase, players evaluate the work of each scientist sponsored during the turn. To evaluate a scientist, roll 2 dice
and add the artist’s rating and any modifiers from CP spent, the Holy
Roman’s “Prague Cultural Center” marker, from the Observatory
science bonus, or from being married to Isabella Clara Eugenia.
Proceed through the scientists sponsored this turn from highest
rating printed on his counter to lowest rating (if tied the scientist
from the power earliest in Impulse Order goes first). If the result is:
6 or less: No victory points are earned and this scientist is finished
for the game. Remove his counter from play.
7 or 8: This scientist did not achieve anything of note this turn.
Remove the scientist from play if he has a 1 rating; otherwise
return him to the pool of available scientists (so he may be used
for a Patronize Scientist action in a future turn).
9: This scientist did not achieve anything of note this turn; return
him to the pool of available scientists.
10 or higher: If available, VP and/or a science Bonus are earned
by this scientist (who is finished for the game). Results from
modified rolls of 10-12 or 13-14 allow the player to choose
how to divide the award between VP and Bonuses. A VP award
earned by scientists is limited by the Science VP markers still
in play. If there are no available markers equal to the VP award
earned, the player must settle for the best available VP marker
that does not exceed the specified VP award. If no VP marker
can be claimed by this roll, a bonus must be chosen. Bonuses
are likewise limited: once one power earns a science bonus, all
other powers are locked out from obtaining that same technology.
Players must claim a bonus that can be of use to their power;
players are not allowed to choose a science bonus solely for the
purpose of denying it to other powers. (See the Scenario Book
for full explanations of Science bonuses).

Le Testu

The French scientist LeTestu doubles as a sea captain.
If any result other than a 9 is received when evaluating
his work as a scientist, remove the sea captain marker
from play as well. Likewise if he is eliminated while
on the World Map as a sea captain, be sure to also remove the
scientist counter.

23. MAJOR POWERS

Rules Manual

This section identifies the rules that apply to specific major powers.

to return to Europe. He must choose 3 treasures if two galleons are
assigned as Treasure Fleet escorts, otherwise he chooses 2. If too
few treasures are present, then the entire row of treasures is chosen.

23.1 Ottoman

3. Determine Attack Zone: The Spanish treasure fleet appears in
a random location. Roll a die to determine that ocean zone:

Suez Canal

Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had excavation
work started at the current sites of the Suez and VolgaDon canals. In Virgin Queen, Ottoman players have the
ability to push through with Mehmed’s plan and complete the Suez canal.
Construction: One of the options with the Grand Vizier Home
card is to play it for an attempt to complete the Suez Canal. Roll
one die: a result of 6 or higher means the canal is constructed.
Keep track of failed attempts by moving the marker to the right on
the Ottoman power card. The chance of completion increases by
one pip with each attempt. The chances can also be enhanced (by
2 pips) if the Ottoman player earns the Excavation science bonus.
Benefits: If the canal is constructed, move the Suez
Canal marker to the “Constructed” box. The Ottoman
player receives these benefits:
• 2 Bonus VP are earned.
•	 The Ottoman receives a +1 card marker for the rest of the game
(place it in the “Constructed” Suez canal box on the Ottoman
power card).
•	 Ottoman expeditions are placed in the Indian Ocean on their
full strength side when constructed (17.4) and they may now
include colonies.

Morisco Revolt

The event Morisco Revolt causes unrest in Spanish
home spaces and adds a specific Ottoman unit counter labeled “Morisco” to the map. The following
restrictions apply to this unit:

•	 It may only be added by this event; it may not be built by
spending CP.
•	 It may never be moved more than 2 spaces from Granada.
•	 It never moves during the Winter Phase.
•	 This unit is eliminated if it is besieging an enemy fortified space
at the start of a Winter Phase.

23.2 Spain

Treasures and the Treasure Fleet

As described in Section 6, four or five treasures are placed on the
Spanish row of treasures at the start of each turn. These treasures
are threatened each turn by World Map pirates who may be awarded
a treasure from this row for a piracy hit (16.5). To more effectively
safeguard these treasures, the Spanish may assign 1 or 2 galleons to
escort the Treasure Fleet during Spring Deployment (10).

Treasure Fleet Attack Procedure

Follow this procedure when resolving the Treasure Fleet Mandatory Event:
1. Add Riches: Draw an additional treasure from the pool and add
it to the row of Spanish treasures.
2. Choose Treasures: During this step, the Spanish player reviews
the row of Spanish treasures and chooses a number of them to try

	 die roll	

Location

	
	
	
	

North Atlantic
Antilles
Spanish Main
Mexican Coast (if Philippines are Spanish,
otherwise Spanish Main).

1-2 	
3-4 	
5	
6	

The English player may choose to reroll this die once if an English
expedition is in one of these zones and an English Informant is
spying on Spain. If there is no expedition in the attack zone, step
4 is skipped.
4. Resolve Attack(s): Each expedition in the attack zone may initiate piracy at no CP cost on the chosen treasures. If more than one
power has an expedition here, resolve the attacks in Impulse Order.
Multiple expeditions from the same power attack in the order chosen
by the owning player. An expedition rolls 1 base die if damaged,
2 if at full strength. Add the piracy rating of the sea captain to get
the final number of dice. The treasure fleet fires back with 1 base
die plus 1 additional die for each escorting galleon. Each roll of a
“5” or a “6” is considered to be a hit. Subtract the number of hits
scored by the treasure fleet from the number of hits scored by the
expedition. If the result is positive, the expedition is victorious. The
resulting number is the number of times the expedition may either:
•	 draw at random one of the treasures chosen in Step 2,
•	 award themselves 1 VP for Piracy, or
•	 eliminate a galleon escorting the treasure fleet
Awards are chosen by the player controlling the expedition who
must divide the hits as equally as possible between the possible
awards. Captured treasures are stored as loot as described in the
World Map piracy procedure. If the number is negative, apply this
number of hits to the expedition. If it is just 1 hit and the sea captain
was not previously damaged, he is damaged now. In all other cases
eliminate the expedition (and discard all its loot).
5. Spain Gains Treasures: Treasures chosen in Step 3 that were not
drawn by the expedition in Step 4 are now added to Spain’s hand.
6. Possible Return Home: If the expedition was not eliminated, it
may optionally return home (using Step 7 of the World Map Piracy
Procedure (16.5).

Spanish Armada		

Initial Placement: Spain may construct
a special naval unit during the game—the
Spanish Armada—through play of their
Home card of the same name. The Armada may only be constructed in Seville,
Corunna or Lisbon (the space must be under Spanish control and
free of unrest). There are two counters for the Armada: one that
shows its strength at 2 or 4 (depending on which side is up), and
another that shows its strength at 6 or 8. The strength number tells
how many dice the Armada rolls in combat, how many total hits it
can absorb, and how many land units it may carry.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Upgrading the Armada: Spain receives CP to upgrade the Armada
from the cards Spanish Armada and Armada Indulgence (but may
also spend CP from other cards or treasures and invest them into
the armada). Every 3 CP spent can upgrade the Armada one level.
Replace the current Armada counter with one that has a strength
number 2 higher. The Armada can be upgraded to a maximum
strength of 8. The Armada must be in port in Seville, Corunna,
or Lisbon to receive an upgrade. It may be upgraded even if it
took losses earlier in the turn or if it moved into port earlier in the
impulse.
Land Units and the Armada: CP from the Spanish Armada home
card (or other cards) can be used to construct Spanish regulars or
mercenaries directly onto the Armada if it is in a Spanish home port
(or Lisbon). When the Armada is in a port space, land units and
army leaders may be freely moved between that space on the Europe
Map and the Armada, as long as the current carrying capacity of
the Armada is not exceeded. Land units in the same space as the
Armada that lost a field battle earlier in the impulse may be placed
onto the Armada and move with it during that same impulse; they
are just restricted from taking a Move action (the same restriction
from 13.1 that applies to any land units that have lost a field battle).
Land units and army leaders already on the Armada may remain
there during the Winter Phase (but units may not move onto the
Armada at this time).
Movement: The Armada moves like any other naval unit (i.e when
a Naval move is purchased for 1 CP). The Armada may move, intercept, or avoid battle in conjunction with a stack of other Spanish
naval units just as if it was another unit in that stack.
Combat: In combat, the Armada rolls the number of dice indicated
by its strength. If a Spanish naval stack takes losses, the Armada
can be downgraded to satisfy those hits. Every 2 hits applied to the
Armada drops it one upgrade level (round the losses up if Spain
must absorb an odd number of hits with the Armada). If after suffering losses the Armada can no longer hold the land units aboard,
excess land units are eliminated. If the Armada is eliminated (by
being downgraded when it is at a strength of 2), place this 2 strength
Armada counter on the Turn Track. It may be rebuilt by Spain in
a future turn.
Naval Transport: If the Armada is in a sea zone, a formation of
land units and army leaders can spend 1 CP to move between the
Armada and an adjacent port space. That port must abide by all
rules for the end space of a naval transport (16.3). If such a move
involves a formation led by a Spanish army leader, it can violate
the usual limit of 5 units per naval transport move as long as the
number of units on the Armada never exceeds the current strength
of the Armada. Land units moving onto the Armada may stop their
naval transport move on the Armada. (This is an exception to the
usual Naval Transport rule that requires land units to end a transport
move back on a land space). This special Armada naval transport
capability is distinct from usual naval transport moves through
Spanish naval units; any such standard naval transport moves would
have to be paid for with additional CP and supported by additional
Spanish naval units.
Naval Blockade: Take the strength of the Armada and divide by 2.
The Armada counts as this many naval units for the purpose of the
naval blockade requirements for initiating an assault.
Loan Prohibited: The Armada may not be lent to another power
by diplomatic agreement.

37

Dual Capital Cities

Spain has two capitals in the game: the official capital (Madrid)
and the center of their military operations (Milan). This benefits
them by allowing them to:
•	 Return home to either capital in the Winter Phase, and
•	 Add 1 regular in each capital in the Winter Phase.
Despite the dual capitals, Spain is still allowed to make only 1 move
during the Spring Deployment Phase.	

Death of Philip II

If Philip II is murdered, the effects are as follows:
•	 Spain drops to no card bonus and 1 Admin rating.

23.3 England

Virgin Queen Home Card

England’s Home Card Virgin Queen has two possible uses. First it
can be used as described in Sections 6.2 and 11 to retrieve a card
from the discard pile. The second use applies if Elizabeth agreed to
marry during this turn’s Diplomacy Phase. In this situation, England
may play the Virgin Queen Home card to break off the marriage at
the last minute (preserving England’s ability to earn 1 Virgin Queen
VP at the end of the turn). If Elizabeth “jilts” her suitor this way, the
groom’s power does receive some compensation. That power rolls
on the Jilted by Elizabeth Table and applies the result immediately.
Mercenaries received must be placed in a space where this power
is eligible to construct units. The power may divide CP between
mercenaries and diplomatic influence as they see fit if the “Spend X
CP on Diplomatic Influence and/or Mercenaries” result is indicated.

Mary Queen of Scots

As former queen of France, queen of Scotland, potential heir to
the throne of England, and a rallying point for European Catholics,
Mary Queen of Scots has a key impact on the struggles of this era.
Mary’s status is in one of these three states during the game:
•	 Alive in Scotland: Mary enters play on Turn 2 when her royal
counter is added to the game. At this time she is queen of
Scotland and available to the French player to use in marriage
negotiations. This state is shown by the absence of a marker for
Mary on the English power card. Play of the Mandatory Event
Scottish Lords Rebel triggers a change in Mary’s status out
of this state.
•	

Captured in England: If resolution of Scottish
Lords Rebel causes Scotland to become an English or Protestant ally, then her status moves to
captured in England. Reflect this change by adding the captured marker for Mary to the English
power card. When Mary is captured, England may choose to
execute her after a failed assassination attempt on Elizabeth I
or failed English Catholic Rebellion. Executing her costs England 1 VP but avoids Mary’s positive modifiers to such actions.

•	 Dead: If Mary is executed by England, flip the marker for
Mary to the “Executed –1 VP” side and place it in the English
Bonus VP box. If Mary is dead the Mary Queen of Scots card
is playable only for CP and no extra dice are awarded for the
presence of Mary during assassination attempts against Elizabeth or English Catholic Rebellions.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Death of Elizabeth I

If Elizabeth dies through childbirth or assassination, the effects
are as follows:
•	 Elizabeth is removed from the marriage pool if still present
there.
•	 The Virgin Queen Home Card is unavailable for the rest of the
game.
•	 England drops to no card bonus and 1 Admin rating
•	 Mary Queen of Scots must be immediately executed by England
if she is currently captured in England (–1 VP to England).
•	 All attempts at English Catholic Rebellion later in this same turn
can add the modifier for Mary Queen of Scots being captured
in England.

23.4 France

Control of Paris

The French power has the ability to earn special VP just by maintaining political control and religious influence over the Paris
space. Award bonus VP to France (or Spain or the Protestant) as
specified in 25.3.

Death of Charles IX

If Charles IX is murdered, the effects are as follows:
•	 France drops to no card bonus and 0 Admin Rating. This effect
lasts until the Henry III Mandatory Event is triggered, making
Henry III the new ruler of France.

Death of Henry III

If Henry III dies through murder or assassination, the effects are
as follows:
•	 Henry III is removed from the marriage pool if still present
there.
•	 Henry III army leader is removed from play.
•	 France drops to no card bonus and 1 Admin rating.

23.5 Holy Roman

Master of Central Europe

The Holy Roman has the ability to earn special VP by maintaining
political control over three keys in Central Europe. During the Victory Phase check to see if Prague, Vienna and Buda are all under
Holy Roman control and free of unrest. If this condition is true,
take a Master of Central Europe Bonus VP marker and add 1 VP
to the current Holy Roman score.

Secret Religious Preference

The Holy Roman Emperors of the period (Maximilian II and Rudolf
II) were much more sympathetic to the Protestant faith than most
other 16th Century Hapsburg rulers. Many believed these rulers were
closet Protestants who preferred the reform faith to Catholicism. In
Virgin Queen, Holy Roman players choose a religious preference
in secret that may enable them to score additional victory points.
Procedure: During the spring deployment of the first turn of the scenario (after negotiations have occurred), the Holy Roman secretly
records (on paper) their religious preference: Protestant, Catholic
or Balanced. This choice remains secret until the Holy Roman
player needs to announce his choice to either (a) earn enough VP
to win the game, or (b) add VP to his score to prevent a Domination
victory by another power. Such a declaration is made during the

Rules Manual

Victory Determination Phase. The amount of special VP earned is
shown in the appropriate Holy Roman column of the “Special VP
by Power” section of the VP display.

Change of Capital

When the Rudolf II Mandatory Event is played and
Rudolf becomes ruler, the Holy Roman player must
move his capital from Vienna to Prague. Transfer the
Holy Roman Capital marker to the Prague space to
show the change. Prague will be the Holy Roman
capital for the rest of the game.

Death of Rudolf II

If Rudolf II is murdered, the effects are as follows:
•	 The Holy Roman drops to no card bonus and 1 Admin rating.

23.6 Protestant

Huguenot vs. Dutch

The Protestant game pieces (control markers, army leaders, and
military units) are divided into Huguenot (light gray) components
that are primarily used in France and Dutch components (orange)
that are predominantly used in the Netherlands.
Hexagonal Control Markers: Although it is recommended that
Dutch control markers be used to mark spaces in the Netherlands and
Huguenot control markers be used to mark spaces in France, these
markers are actually completely interchangeable and can be used as
desired to show control of non-key spaces anywhere on the board.
Square Control Markers: On the other hand, use of square control
markers by the Protestant must follow these exact rules:
•	 Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Brussels: Use only the Dutch
square control markers from the top row of the Protestant power
card to mark control of these three spaces. Control of each of
these keys is worth 3 VP. Control of these keys does not help
the Protestant win a military victory.
•	 All other keys: Use the Huguenot square control markers from
the bottom row of the Protestant power card to mark control of
any other key besides the three listed above. Control of each
of these keys is worth 2 VP. Control of 5 keys outside the
Netherlands wins a Protestant military victory.
The Protestant player receives more cards at the start of the turn
if he has a balance of keys inside and outside of the Netherlands,
as shown by the two rows of control markers on his power card:
•	
•	
•	
•	

0 keys in either row: 4 cards
At least 1 key in each row: 5 cards
At least 2 keys in each row: 6 cards
At least 3 keys in each row: 7 cards

Army Leaders: Huguenot leaders enter play at a Protestantcontrolled fortified home space in France during either Spring
Deployment or a rebellion action in France. Dutch leaders enter play
at a Protestant-controlled fortified home space in the Netherlands
during either Spring Deployment or a rebellion action in the Netherlands. Once placed, Protestant army leaders may lead Huguenot
and Dutch units interchangeably (even a mixed stack of units from
both areas). During the Land Unit Return Home procedure each
turn, the Protestant player may elect to remove Army Leaders from
the map and place them on the Protestant power card. These army
leaders become eligible to reenter play during spring deployment
or a future rebellion.

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Split Force Pool: The Protestant power’s force pool is split into
Huguenot and Dutch units. These force pools are distinct: Huguenot land and naval units must be constructed in Huguenot (white)
home spaces; Dutch land and naval units must be constructed in
Dutch (orange) home spaces. Dutch and Huguenot units may be
grouped together as a single formation for purposes of movement
and combat and may winter in any Protestant-controlled fortified
space. However there are distinctions between the two types of units
when making winter moves to a capital (see below).

39

card that they are fighting. However a major power may never have
more than 8 units on a foreign war card at one time. Major power
units on a foreign war card cannot return home (even in the Winter
Phase) until they have eliminated all of the independent units in
the foreign war. The event Polish Royal Election ends any foreign
war between Poland and the Holy Roman. If such an event is in
progress, end the war as if all independent units were eliminated
by a Fight Foreign War action.

Capitals

The Protestant player may have two
capitals in play: one for Huguenot units
in France and one for Dutch units in the
Netherlands. However there are no fixed
locations for these capitals. Instead, the
Protestant player may designate a capital for each of these areas
during a rebellion in that area (18.5, Rebellion Procedure, Step 5).
This space now serves as a capital for army leaders and units of
that area during the Spring Deployment and Winter Phases and if
units are displaced (12.5). It may not be used as a capital for units
from the opposite area (i.e., Huguenot units may not use the Dutch
capital or vice versa) nor for units of any minor power allies of the
Protestant (such as units from Scotland). The capital remains in
that space unless the space falls to another major power. Place the
capital marker on the Turn Track at that time; it may reenter play
during a rebellion on a future turn. (Exception: The Huguenot
capital may also move due to play of the Paris is Worth a Mass
event).

23.7 Foreign War Cards

The Event cards War in Persia and War with Poland
force the Ottoman or Holy Roman player to divert land
units and/or army leaders off-map to resolve a foreign
conflict. When these events are played, place the Event
card on the map near the affected power’s home spaces. This
power then selects between 3 and 8 land units from any location
on the map (except a space under siege) and moves those units onto
the card. Units may be chosen from multiple stacks in different
spaces. One army leader may be selected from any location and
also moved onto the card. The power playing the event then
specifies the strength of the foreign army; use any available independent land units to represent these foreign units (adding available
minor power units if there are not enough independent ones available). If the foreign army starts with 5 units, the Ottoman or Holy
Roman player will receive 1 War Winner VP when the foreign units
is over; place a War Winner marker on the Foreign War card to
remind players of this fact. To resolve the conflict, the Ottoman or
Holy Roman player must spend 1 CP on the Fight Foreign War
action for each resolution attempt. A field battle then ensues between
the major power units and the independent units on the card. The
battle is resolved just like a field battle on the map, except that there
is no defender to receive one extra die and there is no retreat. If all
independent units are eliminated, the foreign war is over. All remaining major power units on the card are placed back in their
capital (or any other friendly home key if their capital is occupied
by enemy units). If the independent units were not all eliminated,
the major power will have to pay for another Fight Foreign War
action in a future impulse. The Ottoman or Holy Roman player
receives one less card if they are fighting a foreign war during the
Card Draw Phase (use a –1 Card marker as a reminder). Major
powers may construct new land units directly onto a foreign war

24. MINOR POWERS/
INDEPENDENTS

The five minor powers of Ireland, the Papacy, Portugal, Scotland
and Venice can be important partners to many of the powers. All
minor powers have two states: active and inactive. Minors may start
in either of these states as specified by the scenario setup.

24.1 Inactive Minor Powers

In the inactive state, minor power forces behave as follows:
•	 They do not move from their current space.
•	 They do not intercept or avoid battle.
•	 If there are 4 or fewer land units in a space, they will always
withdraw into the fortifications and try to withstand a siege if
their space is entered.
•	 If there are 5 or more land units, they will hold their ground and
fight a field battle. If they lose that field battle, do not retreat
their units from the space as usual. Instead, they retain up to
4 units which withdraw into the fortifications; all other land
units in excess of 4 are eliminated.
•	 Inactive naval units remain in their port and defend if that port
is attacked.

24.2 Activation

Changing a power from inactive to active is called “activation”.
Each minor power can only be activated by three different major
powers, as shown by the entries in the Activate lines at the bottom
of the Diplomatic Influence Table.
Minor powers can be activated in the following ways:
•	 An event has caused the diplomatic status of the minor power
to be evaluated (which is resolved by the procedure in 24.6).
The winning power gets to activate this minor as their new ally
if they are listed as an “Activate” power at the bottom of the
Diplomatic Influence Table.
•	 A major power declared war on this minor power and a different major power intervened according to Step 4 of the War
Declaration Procedure (9.4).

© 2011 GMT Games, LLC

40

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Activation Procedure

1. Place “Allied” Marker: Add an “Allied” marker to the box
that cross-references these powers on the Diplomatic Status
Display.

2. Declarations of War: A power currently at war with this minor power has the choice to immediately declare war (at no cost
in CP) on the major power that is activating the minor power.
That power may only declare war if none of the “restrictions at
all times” listed in Section 9.4 apply. If the power chooses to
declare war, add an “At War” marker to the appropriate box on
the Diplomatic Status Display. If the power declines to declare
war, any units of that power occupying spaces controlled by this
minor power are displaced (12.5).
3. Place Square Control Markers: Remove control markers
from any keys of this minor where the control marker is from a
major power that was eligible to activate this minor during this
status check. Keys of this minor power that now have no control
marker on them are then marked with square control markers
from the activating power.
4. Place Hexagonal Control Markers: Remove control markers
from any non-key spaces of this minor where the control marker
is from a major power that was eligible to activate this minor
during this status check. Non-key spaces of this minor power
that now have no control marker on them are then marked with
hexagonal control markers from the activating power.
5. Remove “At War” Markers: Remove all “At War” markers from this minor power’s column on the Diplomatic Status
Display (this minor power’s diplomacy is now controlled by
their major power ally).
6. Add Irish Rebels: If resolving the status of Ireland, eliminate
all land units present in the Ulster space, add a fortress to that
space (if not already present), and add 3 Irish land units there.
Ireland becomes a minor power ally of the power who won the
Diplomatic Status Procedure. If Dublin is under control of a
different major power, this new ally of Ireland may immediately
declare war on that major power at no CP cost. (Exception: If this
would be Spain declaring war on England, the current CP cost
to declare war between England and Spain must be 3 or less for
this free declaration of war to be permissible). Finally, the power
now allied with Ireland may execute a free Move Formation in
Clear action that is limited to moving a formation from Ulster to
Dublin (such a move much be permissible based on the current
diplomatic status with the power controlling Dublin).

24.3 Active Minor Powers

Activating a minor power has the following benefits:
•	 Military units and naval leaders of this minor power are treated
just like units and naval leaders of the major power. They now
move, fight, retreat, avoid battle, and affect nearby Protestant/
Catholic Conversion attempts just like the other units of that
major power. (The only difference is that minor power units
have no impulse or cards of their own.)
•	 Military units of the minor power have one additional characteristic during the Winter Phase. These units may also
return to a home key of that minor power just as if it were
an additional capital. The units of their major power ally do
not enjoy this option.

Rules Manual

•	 The controlling major power may use the Raise Regular Troop
action to build a regular of this minor power in one of this minor
power’s home spaces (assuming an unbuilt regular exists in the
counter mix).
•	 If the minor power is the Papacy, Venice, or Portugal, the controlling major power may use the Build Galley or Build Galleon
action to build a naval unit of this minor power in one of this
minor power’s home ports (assuming an unbuilt unit exists in
the counter mix).

24.4 Deactivation

Changing a power from active to inactive is called “deactivation”.
Minor powers are only deactivated in one way:
•	 An event has caused the diplomatic status of the minor power
to be evaluated and the power listed as the “Deactivate” power
at the bottom of the Diplomatic Influence Table won that evaluation.
Deactivate a minor power using the following procedure:
•	 Remove the “Allied” marker from the box that cross-references
these powers on the Diplomatic Status Display.
•	 All control markers from this minor’s former ally are removed
from the minor power’s home spaces.
•	 Units from other powers are displaced if they occupy one
of these minor power home spaces that just had a control
marker removed. Move land units to the nearest friendlycontrolled fortified space and naval units to the nearest
friendly-controlled port.
•	 Next, all land units of the minor power return to the nearest friendly-controlled, fortified home space of that minor
power. If no such fortified space is available, return them
to the nearest unfortified space. If no such space exists, the
land units are eliminated.
•	 All naval leaders and units of the minor power return to the
nearest friendly-controlled home port of that minor power. If
no such port exists, the naval units are eliminated and naval
leaders are put on the Turn Track.

24.5 Diplomatic Influence

Any power may spend 1 CP on the Buy Diplomatic
Influence action. The influence may be allocated to any
power that lists the active power in either an Activate
or Deactivate line at the bottom of the Diplomatic Influence Table. Advance the active power’s Influence marker by 1
space. No influence may be purchased if a power’s Influence
marker is already on the “9” space. Influence may also not be
purchased if the influence markers for that power are in the “Resolved this turn” box.

Rules Manual

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

24.6 Resolving Diplomatic Status

A power’s diplomatic status is evaluated based on either an Event
card play or a declaration of war (9.4). Evaluate the power’s status
using the procedure below. Diplomatic status can only be evaluated once per turn for each power; ignore a second such event if it
occurs while all of the influence markers for this power are in the
“Resolved this turn” box.

Diplomatic Status Procedure

1. Determine Competing Powers: Each major power listed as
either an Activate or Deactivate power competes for control of
the power whose diplomatic status is being evaluated.
2. Roll Dice: Each competing major power rolls a single die
and computes a final total by adding their influence points (if
any) with the target power to the roll of the die. France adds 2
to their roll if evaluating Scotland when 3 Scottish home spaces
are under Catholic religious influence; the Protestant adds 2 to
their roll if evaluating Scotland when 3 Scottish home spaces
are under Protestant religious influence.
3. Determine Winner: The power with the highest total in
Step 2 is the winner. In the case of a tie, the winner is the power
listed highest in the list of Activate powers at the bottom of the
Diplomatic Influence Table.
4. Activate: If the winner is listed as an Activate power and does
not currently have this power as an ally, then deactivate the power
from its current ally (if any) and then activate it as an ally or the
winning power. If the Activated power is the Ottoman or Holy
Roman (in a 4 or 5-player game), refer to the Scenario Book for
instructions on Activated Major Powers.
5. Deactivate: If the winner is listed as a Deactivate power, then
deactivate the power from its current ally (if any).
6. Reset Influence: All influence markers in this power’s column
of the Diplomatic Influence Table are placed in the “Resolved
this turn” box. They will be reset to their default positions during
the Winter Phase at the end of the turn.

24.7 Independent Keys and Fortresses

Two keys (Metz and Tunis) and one fortress (Florence) are found
in independent spaces. Florence and Tunis start in an independent
political state in the Campaign scenario; only Florence starts independent in the Armada scenario. Like other independent spaces,
these fortified spaces can be entered by units of any power at any
time. Independent regulars in these spaces may not move; they
simply defend against any power that may be attacking them (just
like an inactive minor power, Section 24.1). These regulars may not
be rebuilt during play (though they may reenter with the City State
Rebels Event card). As soon as these fortified spaces are captured
by a major power, these city states will no longer be independent.
Such a space will be controlled by one major power or another for
the rest of the game, unless they again revert to independent status
due to the play of the City State Rebels Event card.

25. VICTORY

There are six ways to win the game, as explained below. The first
three, Military, Religious, and Catholic Rebellion victories, occur
immediately in the Action Phase when the appropriate condition is
triggered. Victory is usually achieved in the final phase of the turn,
the Victory Determination Phase, typically by the accumulation of
victory points (VP) by each power. The three types of victory that
may be achieved in this phase are the Standard, Domination, and
Time Limit wins.

25.1 Automatic Victories

Military, Religious and Catholic Rebellion Victories are immediate
wins that end the game instantly during the Action Phase. The game
is over, even though the turn has not reached the Victory Determination Phase.

Military Victory

If a power ever gains control of enough keys that the Auto Win
space is open on their power card during the Action Phase, they win
a Military Victory immediately. None of these spaces may contain
an Unrest marker. Note that a Military Victory is not achieved if
a player reveals his Auto Win space during the Diplomacy Phase
(as deals and peace agreements conclude) unless that space is still
revealed when the Action Phase starts.

Religious Victory

If the Protestant power ever achieves religious influence over 50
spaces, it wins a Protestant Religious Victory immediately. None of
these spaces may contain an Unrest marker. If the Protestant space
count ever drops to 9, a Catholic Religious Victory has occurred.
If there are 3 or fewer Protestant spaces in France and Scotland
combined, then the French player wins; otherwise it is a Catholic
Religious Victory for Spain.

Catholic Rebellion Victory

If the Spanish player ever achieves 4 more hits than the English
player in an English Catholic Rebellion, Spain wins an Catholic
Rebellion Victory immediately. A Gunpowder Plot has succeeded
in putting a Catholic monarch on the throne of England.

25.2 Victory Points

Since Military and Religious Victories are uncommon, the game
is usually decided by accumulation of VP. Each power earns victory points as shown in the lower-left section of their power card.
A power’s current VP total is the sum of their base, special, and
bonus VP.

Base

All powers’ base VP are determined by the number of keys they
control. Award the VP shown in the last open box on their power
card. Make sure to mark a box with an Unrest marker for each key
currently in unrest. Boxes with Unrest markers are not considered
“open” when computing base VP. If all spaces are covered, that
power has 0 base VP. The Protestant player adds up base VP as
follows: take the VP from the lower “Keys in France” line and add
3 VP for each key they control in the Netherlands.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Protestant Spaces

Four powers gain special VP based on the number of spaces under
Protestant religious influence in the four religious struggle areas.
Adjust the Protestant Spaces marker on the Protestant Spaces
Track on the Religious Struggle Card whenever an action or event
causes the number of spaces under Protestant influence to go up or
down. Spaces in unrest are never included in the count of Protestant
spaces. Based on the row in which the marker resides, players can
read over to the right along that row to determine the current VP
count for Spain, England and Protestants from the current religious
situation. The Holy Roman total is also determined by looking to
the right of the Protestant Spaces marker. However, since only the
Holy Roman player knows which secret religious preference (23.5)
was selected, he keeps this total a secret. Only when he has enough
VP to win the game (or needs to add VP to prevent a Domination
Victory by another power) does he reveal the religious preference
and add these VP to his score.

Special

The special VP received by each power are as follows:

Bonus

special VP for the Protestant.

•	 Slave Trader (–1 VP)
•	 Mary Queen of Scots Executed (–1 VP)

25.3 Victory Determination Phase

During the Victory Determination Phase, first
award bonus VP for control of Paris and
Central Europe. Update each power’s VP
total on the VP track. Then all powers check
to see if any of the following three types of victories has been
achieved. If after checking for standard and domination victories,
there is still no winner, and this is not yet Turn 7, advance the turn
marker on the Turn Track to the next box and start another turn.

Paris VP

If Paris is controlled by France, Spain or the Protestant and not
under unrest, the controlling power may earn 1 or 2 bonus VP, as
listed below:
France: Gain 2 VP if Paris is under French political control, it is
Turn 5, 6 or 7, and Charles IX or Henry III is the French ruler. If
Paris is under French control but these other conditions are not
met, then 1 VP is earned instead.
Spain: Gain 2 VP if Paris is under Spanish political control, it
is Turn 5, 6 or 7, and the Duke of Guise is in Paris. If Paris is
under Spanish control but these other conditions are not met,
then 1 VP is earned instead.
Protestant: Gain 2 VP if Paris is under Protestant political control, it is Turn 5, 6 or 7, and Henry Navarre is in Paris. If Paris is
under Protestant control but these other conditions are not met,
then 1 VP is earned instead.

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion ~ 1559-1598

Central Europe VP

Award 1 Master of Central Europe VP to the Holy Roman for each
turn in which he controls Prague, Vienna, and Buda (and none of
these spaces are in unrest).

Standard Victory

If any of the powers have reached 25 VP or more, the game ends with
a Standard Victory. The power with the highest VP total is declared
the winner. If two or more powers tie for highest total, the power
with the highest total in the previous turn is declared the winner.
If the powers were tied on that earlier turn, proceed backward one
turn at a time until the tie is broken. Players should record the VP
total of each power at the end of each turn on the Victory Record
Sheet (found at the back of the rulebook).

Domination Victory

If during the Victory Determination Phase a power’s VP total is less
than 25, but is at least 5 VP greater than each of the other powers,
it wins a Domination Victory. This victory can only occur in the
Victory Determination phase of Turn 4 or later; thus do not check
for a Domination Victory during Turns 1, 2, and 3.

Time Limit Victory

If no player has won by the end of Turn 7, award the win to the
power with the highest VP total at that time. If two or more powers
tie for highest total, the power with the highest total in the previous
turn is declared the winner. If the powers were tied on that earlier
turn, proceed backward one turn at a time until the tie is broken.
A Time Limit Victory can only occur in the Victory Determination
Phase at the end of Turn 7.
