RULEBOOK

• INGREDIENT LEGEND •

(Futilis riempitivus)

UNICORN TEARS
Unicorn tears are the purest fluid known in the
world of magic. Just use a few drops to catalyze
very powerful magical effects.
Collecting unicorn tears is very easy! They
are always depressed. Find one, make fun of
his horn, and prepare for the shower.
Bring a huge barrel.

OGRE MUCUS
This extremely viscous substance is used to
thicken compounds otherwise too volatile.
Always use a mask when you handle it.
Swamp ogres often take a cold. Go to a marsh.
Bring a big box of paper tissue. Follow the
sneezing.
Not recommended for the faint of stomach.

DRAGON SMOKE
The toxic fumes exhaled by these dreadful
reptiles are often used for their high magical
reactivity. Beware, never, ever inhale them!
To obtain a dragon’s smoke, poke its nose
until it gets really, really angry. Collect the
smoke with a flask.
Run before he incinerates you.

FAIRY DANDRUFF
A very powerful ingredient. Also used by
naughty children who refuse to grow up, to
kidnap other kids and lead them astray.
Catch a fairy and gently brush its hair with a
small comb. Avoid happy thoughts, or you may
find yourself smashing through the ceiling in no
time.

Dear students,
It’s that time of the year.
Your last year at the Horribilorum Sorcery Academy for Witty Witches and Wizards is almost over, and it’s time for the final exams!
As always, the rules are the same: Take the Ingredients from the Dispenser in the Potions Lab to complete your Potions. Keep in mind that
the explosions you may trigger can be useful! The use of Potions you brew during this exam is not only allowed, but encouraged!
Use them wisely to do a quicker and better job, and it will prove your worth as a soon-to-be witch or wizard.
When enough Skill Tokens have been awarded, the exam will end. Remember, though, that in order to win the Student of
the Year Award, you’ll need to be the one who brewed the most difficult (and valuable) potions!
Good luck!

• THE GAME IN A NUTSHELL •

(De horribilis gamesibus, quickitur)

To brew your Potions, take one Ingredient marble from the Dispenser
each turn, and make Ingredients of the same color collide to make
them explode (and take them too)! The bigger the explosions, the
faster you’ll brew your potions!
Each Potion recipe may need between 4 and 7 Ingredients. They are
represented by the holes on the Potion tiles themselves.
Put the marbles of the correct color on your Potion tiles: when all the
holes have been filled with a marble of the corresponding color, the
Potion is completed.

Each Potion is worth a certain number of points, which depends on
the number of Ingredients needed to complete it and the strength of
the magical power it grants.

When a player completes 3 Potions with the same power, or 5 Potions
with 5 different powers, they receive a Skill token, which is worth 4 points.
When the required number of Skill tokens have been awarded, the end
of the game is triggered.
The player with the most points is the winner.

• GAME SETUP •

(Preparatio gameus)

1. Each player receives a Desk board and places
it in front of himself, leaving some space both
above and below it.

For your first few games, I suggest you to leave out
the Balm of Uttermost Stickiness and
Filter of Lavamancing potions. Only the
most talented potion brewers possess the
necessary expertise to handle them!

2. The player that most recently prepared a drink
is the first player and takes the First Player
token. This is just a reminder: it won’t change
during the game. Players play in turns, in
clockwise order.
3. Take all the Potion tiles and remove 2
of the 8 different kinds of Potions, either
randomly or by choice, and put them
back into the box (they won’t be used
during the game).

4. From the 6 remaining kinds of Potion
tiles, take 2 random starter Potion tiles
(marked with the symbol ) per player,
and lay them out in the middle of the table,
with the Recipe side (the one with the grey
ribbon) facing up. Starting from the First
Player and proceeding clockwise, each
player takes one Starter Potion tile. Once
all players have taken 1 Potion tile, each
player takes a second Starter Potion tile,
starting with the last player and proceeding
counterclockwise.
5. Each player places their 2 starter Potion
tiles, with their Recipe side up, on the two
Bunsen burners of their Desk. This will be
their Brewing area.
6. Once all the players have chosen their
Starter Potion tiles, shuffle the remaining
tiles together and divide them into 5 stacks,
with the Recipe side facing up.
7. Put all the Ingredient marbles in the “tank”
of the Dispenser, and make sure they roll
down to completely fill the 5 tracks of the
slide (see Refilling the Dispenser, page 7).

OR

8. Place all the Little Help tokens and the Skill
tokens near the Dispenser. Put some of the
Skill tokens in a “countdown” stack (see
End of Game, page 9). The number of Skill
tokens to be put in this stack depends on the
number of players (see the following table):

• GAME TURN •

(Turnis explanatio)

Hi, I am the professor. I talk a lot. What I say is
generally useful though, so maybe read it, okay?

A game of Potion Explosion™ is played in turns. Players take turns in
clockwise order. During your turn, you MUST choose and take 1 Ingredient
marble from the Dispenser. This may trigger one or more Explosions. In
addition, at any point during your turn, you MAY drink one or more of your
completed Potions AND/OR ask for a Little Help from the Professor.

TAKING INGREDIENTS

8 7 6 5
4 3 2 1

(Ingredientorum pick)

As described above, to take an Ingredient from the Dispenser, you simply
have to choose and take one. You can freely choose any marble that is visible
on the Dispenser, except for the 9th marble on each slide track (see the
diagram to the left). This is your regular pick for the turn.

TRIGGERING AN EXPLOSION

The red marble is
taken and starts a
chain reaction.

The three yellow
marbles collide
(and explode).
They are all taken.

Next, the two black
marbles collide and
explode. They are
also taken.

No more marbles
of the same colour
collide. The chain
reaction stops.

1

(Causatio boom boom)

As you can easily imagine, when an Ingredient marble is removed from the
slide, all the marbles above it with roll down to fill the gap. This is when an
Explosion can occur!
If two Ingredient marbles of the same color collide, they explode. When two
Ingredients explode, all of the Ingredients of that color connected to them
also explode. You take all of the exploding Ingredients, just like the one you
directly picked from the Dispenser.

2
Not all students notice this at once: when there are three or more
connected marbles of the same color, if you pick one of those from the
middle, you still trigger an Explosion by making the others collide!
That’s a pretty neat move, don’t you think?

3

4

If, after removing all of the exploding Ingredients, there is another collision
between marbles of the same color, this new collision will trigger another
Explosion, and you also take all of those exploding Ingredients. If, after that,
another collision between marbles of the same color occurs, a third Explosion
will happen, etc. (see the example to the left).
Note that those two blue Ingredient marbles in the last step of the
example—even though involved in a collision—do not explode. An
Explosion occurs only when two or more marbles of the same color
collide with each other. Moreover, if you trigger a particularly
big chain of Explosions, one or more slide tracks can end up being
partially empty. This is not a problem.

5

WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE PROFESSOR

(Professorum helpus capiendum est)

It’s better to ask for my Little Help before
you take your regular pick for
the turn. If you do it wisely,
you can create the perfect
conditions to trigger huge
chain reactions!!!

At any point during your turn (and only once per turn), before or after your
regular pick, you MAY ask for a Little Help from the Professor—i.e. take a
Little Help token and 1 Ingredient marble of your choice from the Dispenser.
LUDIX
When you take an Ingredient marble using the Little Help fromORDERUM
the professor,
you cannot trigger an Explosion, even if you make 2 marbles of the same
color collide.

For each Little Help token you lose 2 points at the end of the game.

A Little Help

USING THE INGREDIENTS

(Usando marbles ad victoriam)

After taking Ingredients, either with your regular pick, a Little Help from
the professor, or by drinking a Potion (see Drinking Potions, page 7), you
will have a number of marbles in hand. To use them, you have the following
options:
• First, you must place any Ingredients in your hand on the matching empty
holes of the same color on any Potion tiles brewing on your Desk, if
possible (a yellow marble goes on a yellow hole, etc.). Once an Ingredient
has been placed on a Potion tile, it cannot be moved until the Potion is
complete.
• If you have Ingredient marbles in hand that you cannot place on any Potion
tile in your Brewing area, you must place those Ingredients in the small
retort flask on your Desk. This is called your Ingredient Pool. During your
turn, you may freely move Ingredients between your Pool and your hand.
The Ingredient Pool can only hold up to 3 Ingredients at a time. You can
only hold Ingredients in your hand until the end of your turn (see End of
Turn, page 7).

Place marbles on holes
of the corresponding
color on your Potion

Example: Heiko has 7 marbles in his hand: 4 red and 3 black.
He has 2 blue marbles in his Pool left from his last turn. He
places the 4 red marbles and 1 blue marble taken from his
Pool on the Potions on his Desk. He wants to keep all the black
marbles, so he takes the other blue marble from his Pool back
into his hand and places the 3 black marbles into his Pool. Then
he ends his turn, and discards the blue marble back into the
Dispenser.

It goes without saying that, after you end your turn, you won’t be able
to move Ingredients out of your Pool until your next turn starts.

Effect
Point Value

COMPLETING A POTION

(Completius potionibus)

When all of the holes of a Potion tile have been filled with Ingredients, that
Potion has been completed. Put all of the marbles from the Potion back into
the Dispenser (see Refilling the Dispenser, page 7), then flip the Potion tile
from its front (the Recipe side) to its back (the Completed side) and move it
in the area below your Desk. This is your Potion area.

6

Potions are worth a certain number of points at the end of the game (as
shown on the tile itself), and they can also be drunk to activate special onetime magical effects (see Drinking Potions, page 7).

DRINKING POTIONS

(Gulpere potionibus)

A Completed
potion
The same
potion, after
drinking it.

You can also drink Potions as soon as you complete them, if you
wish. This exam aims to prove your worth as witches and
wizards, not to merely test your theoretical knowledge of
potions. Being able to make good use of the fruit of your
labor and turn it to your advantage is a critical skill!

At any time during your turn, you may drink one or more of the Potions you
have completed to activate their magical effects. Each Potion is a one-use
special power: once a Potion has been drunk, it can’t be drunk again.
To show that a Potion was used, just rotate it upside-down. Then, you can
apply its effects.
When you use a Potion to take marbles from the Dispenser, you never
trigger Explosions—Explosions can only be triggered when you use your
regular pick for the turn. In the same way, you don’t trigger Explosions when
you use a Little Help from the professor.
Using a Potion does not make you lose the Potion tile: it still counts as a
complete Potion, and it’s still worth the same number of points at the end of
the game.

REFILLING THE DISPENSER

(Dispenserium refillatus)

When you have to put Ingredient marbles into the Dispenser, you have to
follow a couple little rules:
• Randomly roll the marbles onto the lid: Do not try to direct them to the
entrance hole of any specific slide track.
• Fill all the slide tracks whenever possible: If one or more of the marbles
end up laying on top of another marble (i.e. the track they ended up going
into is already full, and they stick out from the lid), move them into the
entrance hole of the nearest slide track with empty space.

END OF TURN

(Endius turnum)

Refilling the
Dispenser

After you have taken your regular pick for the turn, you asked for the Little
Help from the professor if you wanted to, and you have drunk all the Potions
you intended to, your turn ends; follow these steps, in order:
• If you still have marbles in your hand and your Ingredient Pool is already
full, you must discard them back into the tank of the Dispenser.

You will always have 2 Potion tiles in the Brewing
area of your Desk at the beginning of each turn, and
you won’t be able to complete more than 2 Potions in
a single turn. Hah!

• If you have less than 2 Potion tiles in your Brewing area, you must choose
and draw new Potions from the top of any of the five stacks available and
place them on your Bunsen burners. Note: you may not move Ingredients
from your pool to the Potion tiles you just drew, because you already
finished your turn.
• Check to see if you earned one or more Skill tokens (see Skill tokens,
page 8).
• Check to see if the game end has been triggered (see End of Game,
page 9).

• SKILL TOKENS •

(Achievius rewardius)

Skill tokens are special rewards for students who prove themselves particularly
talented... either by mastering one specific Potion, or for being able to brew a lot
of different ones!
For each kind of Potion, when you complete your 3rd Potion of that kind (i.e.,
with the same power), you automatically receive a Skill token (but you don’t
gain another token if you complete 6 Potions of the same kind).
Also, when you complete your 5th different kind of Potion (i.e., completing
Potions with 5 different powers), you automatically receive a Skill token (but you
don’t gain another Skill token if you complete a second set of 5 different Potions).
Skill tokens are received from the “countdown” stack (or from the general pool if the
“countdown” stack is empty). Each Skill token is worth 4 points at the end of the game.
I should not have to point this out, but... better safe than sorry:
you don’t have to “create sets of Potion tiles” and “spend” them
to receive Skill tokens. Think of each Skill token as an
“achievement”: once you have obtained it once, you
can’t obtain it a second time for the same reason.
Also, a single Potion tile can be used to obtain more
than one “achievement”.

A Skill token

8

Example: By completing the potions depicted above, José
obtained 3 Skill tokens at the end of the game. The first was
obtained when completing the 3rd Filter of Lavamancing (A).
The second was obtained when completing the 3rd Elixir of
Blind Love (B). Note that even if José ended up completing 6
Filters of Lavamancing, he didn’t obtain a second Skill token
(since the token is awarded when you complete your 3rd Potion
of one same kind, not for each set of 3). Finally, the third was
obtained when completing a 5th different kind of Potion (C).
Again, even if he completed 6 kinds of Potions in total, no
additional Skill token was awarded because the goal of “at least
5 different kinds of Potions” was already achieved.

We suggest these numbers of Skill tokens so that your games last
a reasonable amount of time (not too short,not too long). But, if
you have particularly slow or overthinking players at the table,
or if you feel confident enough with the basics of
the game, feel free to agree on a different number
at the beginning of play, if you‘d like to have
shorter or longer games!

(Calculatio finalis pointibus)

During the game setup, you placed a certain number of Skill tokens into a
“countdown” stack (see table to the right). If, at the end of any player’s turn,
the last of the Skill tokens from the “countdown” stack has been taken, the
end of the game is triggered. The end of the game is also triggered if, at the
end of any player’s round, there are no more Potion tiles available.
The game continues, in clockwise order, until the player to the right of the
First Player completes their next turn (so that all players will have played
the same number of turns during the game). Even if the required number of
Skill tokens have already been awarded, players can still earn more from the
general pool, if they are able to do so.
After this, all players add up the points they obtained from all the Potion tiles
they completed and the Skill tokens they collected, then subtract 2 points for
each Little Help token they have.
The player with the most points is the winner!
In case of a tie, all the tied players (starting from the First Player, in turn
order) each take one marble from the Dispenser to try to trigger an
Explosion. The player who takes the most marbles in this way is the winner.

Example: It’s a 4-player game. Heiko was the first player at the
beginning of the game, and just finished his turn after taking
the 5th Skill token from the “countdown” stack—his second—
leaving one Skill token in the stack. Now it’s David’s turn. He
manages to earn the last Skill token from the “countdown”
stack, which triggers the end of the game. Jose and Anna
will both have one final turn to play, then the game will
end. José plays next, but does not earn any Skill token on his
turn. During her turn, Anna manages to get 1 Skill token for
“The 3rd Potion of one same kind”, and another for “The 5th
different kind of Potion”. Since the “countdown” stack is empty,
she takes them from the general pool. At the end of Anna’s
turn, the game is over. The players can finally calculate their
final scores.
