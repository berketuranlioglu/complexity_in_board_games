A Distant Plain

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.2 Components

A Distant Plain is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent
and counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict in modern Afghanistan. Each
player takes the role of a Faction seeking to guide Afghan affairs:
the international Coalition, the Afghan Government, the Islamist
Taliban, or narco-trafficking Warlords. Using military, political,
and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build
and maneuver forces to influence or control the population, extract
resources, or otherwise achieve their Faction’s aims. A deck of
cards regulates turn order, events, victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player Factions, enabling solitaire,
2-player, or multi-player games.
A Distant Plain is a volume in the COIN Series of games that
use similar rules to cover a variety of insurgencies. Volume I was
Andean Abyss, set in Colombia. The Playbook lists major rules
differences from Andean Abyss.
This rule book lists and defines key game terms in an index on
pages 16-17. The most important game functions are summarized
on several aid sheets. Game set up is explained on pages 19-20
of this rule book.

1.1 General Course of Play

A Distant Plain—unlike many card-assisted war games—does not
use hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one
at time, with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event
card shows the order in which the Factions become Eligible to
choose between the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations
and Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries
the penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next
card. Propaganda cards mixed in with the Event cards provide
periodic opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as
collecting resources and influencing popular sympathies.

A complete set of A Distant Plain includes:

•	 A 22”x34” mounted game board (1.3).
•	 A deck of 78 cards (5.0).
•	 158 medium and light blue, tan, black, and green wooden forces
pieces, some embossed (1.4; see “Available Forces” on page 19
for a complete listing).
•	 7 embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.2).
•	 6 red and 6 white pawns (3.1.1).
•	 A sheet of markers.
•	 A Sequence of Play sheet (2.0, 6.0).
•	 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0).
•	 A Non-player aid foldout (8.0).
•	 A Random Spaces sheet (8.2).
•	 3 6-sided dice—1 tan, 1 black, 1 green.
•	 A background play book.
•	 This rule book.

1.3 The Map

The map shows the country of Afghanistan divided into various types
of spaces, as well as parts of neighboring countries.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Provinces, the City of
Kabul, and roadways called Lines of Communication (LoCs). All
spaces—including LoCs—can hold forces.
1.3.2 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population value (Pop)
of 0, 1, or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to
the Government (1.6) or Control (1.7) and some Insurgent actions.
The Govern activity (4.3.1) can increase Population. Provinces are
further distinguished as Mountain or Plains, affecting Government

Assault (3.2.4) and Events (5.0), or Pakistan (1.3.5), affecting Stacking (1.4.2). Several are of Pashtun ethnicity, affecting Events and
Insurgent Operations.
1.3.3 City. The City of Kabul shows Pashtun ethnicity and a Population value of 3.
NOTE: Each Population value represents about a million Afghans.

1.3.4 LoCs. Each Line of Communication (LoC) shows an Economic value (Econ) of 1 to 4 that affects Government Resources
(1.8) and the Taliban Extort activity (4.3.1). LoCs are never Pashtun
(1.3.2-.3).
1.3.5 Foreign Countries. The map includes parts of Pakistan, Iran,
and several Central Asian republics. Only Pakistan has playable
spaces (1.3.1). They are three Provinces where only Taliban forces
may stack (1.4.2).
1.3.6 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any 2 spaces meeting one of the
following conditions are adjacent:
•	 Spaces that border on (touch) one another.
•	 Provinces separated by LoCs.
•	 LoCs or Provinces separated by Towns.

NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely terminate LoCs.

3

Police (light-blue cubes), Insurgent Guerrillas, and all Factions’
Bases.
DESIGN NOTE: Bases represent training and bivouac facilities,
political administration, and, for the Insurgents, poppy fields.
PLAY NOTE: Use “Overflow” boxes for pieces that exceed the room
in a space on the map; place the lettered marker in that space.
1.4.1 Availability and Removal. The inventory shown on the
“Available Forces” chart on page 19 of this rule book limits the
number of pieces that may be in play. Keep forces not on the map
in the Available Forces boxes. (Place Taliban and Warlord Bases in
the highest- and Coalition in the lowest-numbered empty spaces,
revealing the number of on-map Bases and Available Coalition pieces
to help track Resource earnings, 6.2, and victory, 7.0.) NOTE: See
also Casualties (3.3.3, 6.6).
•	 Forces may only be placed from or replaced with those in the
Available boxes—ignore any instructions to place forces if the
appropriate type is not available (remove rather than replace such
pieces). EXCEPTIONS: Taliban in Pakistan (1.4.2); Training
(3.2.1).
•	 Important: Taliban and Warlord players (only), while executing
an Operation, Special Activity, or Event, may remove their
own pieces to Available Forces. EXAMPLE: Insurgents without
Available Guerrillas could remove Guerrillas during a Rally
(3.3.1) in order to place them Underground.
Markers

ADJACENCY EXAMPLE: Faryab Province and the LoC ending
at the town of Shibirghan are adjacent, as are the Provinces north
and south of the LoC.

1.4 Forces

The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: Coalition
Troops (tan cubes), Government Troops (medium-blue cubes) and

•	 Once an enemy Faction is targeted, removal or Activation of
pieces to the extent of the executing Faction’s ability is required.
EXAMPLE: A Coalition Assault (3.2.4) with 3 Troops must
remove 3 Active pieces if there are that many among the Factions
targeted.
1.4.2 Stacking. No more than 2 Bases (regardless of Faction) may
occupy a single Province or Kabul. Bases may not occupy LoCs.
Only Taliban forces may occupy spaces in Pakistan (1.3.5).
•	 Ignore any instructions (such as from Operations or Events) to
place or move forces if stacking would be violated. Instruction to
replace an enemy piece never affects Taliban in Pakistan (1.3.5,
1.4.1).
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas are either
Underground—symbol end down—or Active—
symbol end up. Certain actions and Events flip them
from one to the other state. Bases, Troops, and
Police are always Active. Always set up and place new Guerrillas
Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla,
it is sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay
Active).

1.5 Players & Factions

A Distant Plain is playable by 1, 2, 3, or 4 players. The 1st player
plays the Coalition (tan) or the Taliban (black), the 2nd the other, the
3rd the Government (blue), and the 4th the Warlords (green) (2.1).
Coalition and Government are Counterinsurgent (COIN) Factions;
Taliban and Warlords are Insurgents. Insurgent Factions are enemy
to all others. Leftover Factions are Non-Players governed by rules
section 8.
No Non-Player Option: If learning the game with 2 or 3 players, ignore the Non-Player rules (8.0). Instead, players control
leftover Factions:
•	 With 3 players, Coalition controls Warlords.
•	 With 2 players, Coalition controls Government or, if preferred, Warlords; Taliban controls the remaining Faction.
Play only stops on a victory check (6.1) if all of a player’s Factions are meeting their conditions.
After a final Propaganda, use the lowest victory margin of each
player’s Factions (7.3). Players may not voluntarily transfer
(1.5.1) between their own Factions.
1.5.1 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. All negotiations are open. The rules do not bind
players to agreements.
•	 Factions other than the Coalition may voluntarily transfer
Resources (1.8) to others at any time that the giving or receiving
Faction is executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event.
•	 The Government may voluntarily transfer Patronage to Warlord
Resources, 1 for 1, when either Faction is executing an Operation,
Special Activity, or Event.

DESIGN NOTE: Kabul traditionally governed via patronage to
local leaders.

1.6 Support and Opposition

Support and Opposition affect victory and some operations and
activities.
1.6.1 Kabul and Afghan Provinces with at least 1 Population (1.3.2)
always show 1 of 3 levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition
to Afghanistan’s central government that can shift during play:
•	 Support.
•	 Neutral.
•	 Opposition.

1.6.2 Show Support or Opposition with markers
placed in Kabul or each such Province. Show
Neutral spaces by the absence of such markers.

NOTE: LoCs (1.3.4) and Provinces with 0 Population or in Pakistan
(1.3.5) never have Support or Opposition (they are always Neutral).
If a 0 Population Province receives a +1 Pop marker (4.3.1), it
becomes a 1 Pop Province in all respects.

1.7 Control

Either the two Counter-insurgent (COIN)
Factions together (Coalition and Government) or the Taliban alone Control a Province or Kabul if their pieces there exceed
those of all other Factions combined. If neither COIN nor Taliban
Controlled, the space is uncontrolled. Control affects certain Faction
activities and victory. Adjust Control markers as Control changes
due to Operations (3.0), Special Activities (4.0), Events (5.0), voluntary force removal (1.4.1), or the Propaganda Round (6.0).

1.8 Resources, Aid, and Patronage

At any moment, each Faction except the
Coalition has between 0 and 75 Resources that it uses to pay for Operations (3.0).
During Propaganda Rounds (6.3.1) and
some Events, a level of Aid (between 0
and 75) adds to Government Resources. A level of Patronage (0 to
40) adds to Government victory (7.0). Mark Resources, Aid, and
Patronage on the edge track—for Resources, with a cylinder of the
Faction’s color (1.5).

DESIGN NOTE: Patronage represents wherewithal of government
officials to reward their friends, sometimes by diverting foreign aid,
a means of governance often viewed in the West as corrupt.

1.9 Victory Markers

Similarly track with markers on the edge track the following totals that affect victory (7.0).

•	 Total Population in Support (1.6) plus the number of
Coalition pieces Available (1.4.1).
•	 Total Population in Opposition (1.6) plus the number
of Taliban Bases on the map.
•	 Total Population Controlled by the COIN Factions
(1.7) plus Patronage (1.8).
•	 Total Uncontrolled Afghan Population (1.7).
PLAY NOTE: With many Uncontrolled spaces, it can be
easiest to find Uncontrolled Population by subtracting

© 2013, 2015 GMT Games, LLC

A Distant Plain
COIN- and Taliban-Controlled Population from the total Afghan
Population of 25 (or higher total from any add “+1 Pop” markers
[4.3.1]).
NOTE: The 12 “Deception” markers are for a victory-related optional rule (7.3).

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up

Follow the instructions on pages 19 to 20 of this rule book to choose
a scenario and various play options, assign Factions to players,
prepare the deck, and set up markers and forces.

2.2 Start

Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of the
draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played first; the card
on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE: Players will see
1 card ahead into the deck (2.3.7). All played cards and the number
of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the Sequence
of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Propaganda Rounds [6.0],
advance the Prop Card marker).

2.3 Event Card

When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event; other Factions may Pass and collect Resources.

•	 Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction symbols shown at top
of the card.
•	 Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event
on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card
in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.7). Factions that did are Ineligible. (All
Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free Operations, 3.1.2.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost symbol
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible to
execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost is the
2nd Eligible. NOTE: Gray halos around some Faction symbols
relate only to Non-player instructions (8.4.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction opts to Pass, it remains
Eligible for the next card and receives +1 Resource if an Insurgent
Faction or provides +3 Resources to the Government if either COIN
Faction. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing
Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the same
options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction
Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.

Faction
Order

OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction does
not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation or possibly the
Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
•	 Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
•	 Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction may
execute a Limited Operation or instead execute the Event .
•	 Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd
Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special Activity
if desired.
NOTE: The game board and Sequence of Play aid sheet also show
these options.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is a player Operation
in just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited Operation
is a Patrol (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2), it can involve
pieces from multiple spaces but only 1 destination space. A Limited
Operation counts as an Operation. See also Final Event Card (2.3.8),
Islamabad Sponsorship (6.6.1), and Non-player Operations (8.1).
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events
(or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders
on the Sequence of Play track as follows:
•	 Any Faction that did not execute an Operation or Event (and was
not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
•	 Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise
specified by the Event; see also Free Operations, 3.1.2).

2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw deck’s
next card. Play that card, proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
Sudden Propaganda Option: For less foreknowledge, if all
players agree at Setup (2.1), whenever the next card is revealed
as Propaganda, instead switch the places of the 2 showing
cards and conduct an immediate Propaganda Round (6.0). The
switched Event card will be the first card of the next Campaign
(unless the game ends that Round). Ignore rule 2.3.8 below
regarding the Final Event Card.
2.3.8 Final Event Card. On the last Event card before the final
Propaganda Card (2.4.1), any player Operations must be Limited
(2.3.5, no Special Activities) and may not include Sweep (3.2.3) or
March (3.3.2).

2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.
FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass (2.3.3),
it may execute either:
•	 An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—
or
•	 The Event shown on the card.

2.4 Propaganda Card

If playing a Propaganda Card, conduct a Propaganda
Round (see 6.0), marking each phase on the Sequence
of Play with the “Prop Card” marker.

2.4.1 Final Propaganda. If the last Propaganda
card’s Round is completed without a victory (6.1), the game ends:
determine victory by 7.3.
PLAY NOTE: Set aside Propaganda cards to show how many have
gone by. Each series of Event cards up to a Propaganda Round is
called a “Campaign”.

3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General

A Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction aid sheet and, if applicable, selects the
map spaces to be involved. Operations usually cost Resources (not
Aid or Patronage,1.8), often per space selected; the paying Faction
must have enough Resources to pay for the Operation, including
in each selected space. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation.
NOTE: The Coalition does not have Resources of its own but often
expends Government Resources in its Operations.
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which the
Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions or pieces to be affected
(targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed or replaced. A single
Operation may target one or more Factions and ignore others. Once
targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent
possible (1.4.1).
3.1.1 Pawns. Players may mark spaces selected for Operations
(3.0) and Special Activities (4.0), respectively, (or other actions)
with white and red pawns. The pawns are for convenience, not a
limit on play.

have COIN Control (unlike in the Support Phase, by any COIN
pieces). The Civic Action costs 3 Government Resources per
Terror marker removed and level shifted, even if the Training
Operation was free. OR
•	 If Government, replace any 3 Government cubes with 1
Government Base (from map if needed, within stacking,1.4.2),
OR
•	 If Coalition and the space is Kabul, transfer 3 Patronage to Government Resources.
3.2.2 Patrol. Patrolling protects LoCs by moving Troops or Police
onto them and finding and removing Guerrillas there. If Government, pay 3 Resources total (not per space); if Coalition, the cost
is 0. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end on
a single destination space.
PROCEDURE: Move any number of your Faction’s cubes from
any spaces. Each cube may move into any adjacent LoC or Kabul
(1.3.3) and may keep entering adjacent LoCs or Kabul until the
player chooses to stop moving it or it enters a Sabotaged LoC
(3.3.4). Then, in each LoC (whether or not a cube just moved there
and even if the Patrol is a Limited Operation), Activate 1 Guerrilla
for each cube there. Then, if desired, Assault (3.2.4) in 1 LoC at no
added cost. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the Assault must be in
the destination LoC.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweep Operations may move Troops and also can
locate enemy Guerrillas. Select any Provinces or Kabul as destinations (not Pakistan, 1.4.2). Pay 3 Government Resources per
space selected. Coalition pays Resources only for spaces to which
Government Troops move. Sweep is not allowed on the final Event
card (2.3.8).
PROCEDURE: First, move any of your Faction’s adjacent Troops
desired into selected spaces. In addition, each group of Troops may

3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Operations
or Special Activities: they cost no Resources and, if executed by a
Faction other than the one playing an Event, could leave it Eligible
(2.3.6). Other requirements and procedures still apply unless trumped
by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).

3.2 COIN Operations

The Coalition and Government choose from Train,
Patrol, Sweep, and Assault Operations. NOTE: Factions other than
the Taliban may never place or move pieces into Pakistan (1.4.2).
3.2.1 Train. Training augments Government forces and can build
Support (1.6) or reduce Patronage (1.8). Select among any Provinces
or Kabul. Pay 3 Government Resources per selected space. The
Coalition may only select a Province if it has Coalition pieces and
only spends 3 Resources if it places cubes.
PROCEDURE: First, in each selected Province with a COIN
Faction’s Base and in Kabul, place up to 6 Government cubes
(any combination of Government Troops and Police). If no more
Government cubes are Available (1.4.1), cubes may be taken from
elsewhere on the map. The Coalition may place Government cubes
only if the space (including Kabul) has a Coalition Base. Then, in
up to 1 selected space, either:
•	 Conduct Civic Action (6.4.1) to build Support. The space must

EXAMPLE: The Coalition selects Kandahar for a Sweep. No LoCs
are Sabotaged. Two Coalition Troops move from Kabul onto the LoC
south and from there into Kandahar Province, taking 2 Government
Troops with them. The Coalition Troops in Zabol also could enter
Kandahar.

A Distant Plain
first move onto an adjacent LoC (1.3.4) that is free of Sabotage
(3.3.4) and then into an adjacent space. (Any Troops that move
must reach spaces paid for as destinations.) Each moving Coalition
cube may take with it 1 Government Troops cube that begins in the
same space.

•	 Then, in each selected space, Activate 1 Guerrilla (1.4.3) for each
Government cube there (Police plus Troops, whether they just
moved or were already there).
•	 If a Coalition Sweep, Activate 1 Guerrilla for each cube there (of
any Faction) only if any Coalition piece present.
•	 If a Government Sweep, Government transfers 1 Resource to
Warlords (if it has any) for each LoC entered containing any
Guerrillas (regardless of whose).
3.2.4 Assault. Assaults eliminate Insurgent forces. Select any
spaces—if the Coalition (rather than the Government) is executing
the Assault, select only spaces that have Coalition Troops. Pay 3
Resources per space selected. Coalition Assault costs 3 Government
Resources per space only if the Coalition player opts for Government
cubes there to cause enemy losses.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove Active Guerrillas
(1.4.3) per the number of cubes there, as follows.

•	 If a Government Assault, count only Government cubes and
remove 1 enemy piece for every 2 cubes (round down) there or
every 3 cubes in Mountain.
•	 If a Coalition Assault, count Coalition cubes and—only if
Government Resources paid—Government cubes and remove 1
enemy piece for each cube.
•	 In Kabul or on LoCs, count Troops and Police; in Provinces,
Troops only.
BASES LAST: Once a targeted Faction has no Guerrillas in the
Assault space, remove its Bases instead. For each Taliban Base
removed by Government Assault, add +6 Aid.
DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less hard hitting than COIN forces
but enjoy an information advantage in that counterinsurgents must
Activate (locate) them before Assaulting them.
NOTE: The Faction aid sheets use the phrase “Bases last” to
remind that an Operation cannot remove an enemy Base as long
as the owning Faction’s Guerrillas, Troops, or Police remain in
the space. A Faction’s Underground Guerrillas in a space prevent
further removal via Assault of its pieces (including Bases) until the
Guerrillas are Activated. Also, any cubes protect all COIN Bases
from Attack (3.3.3).

3.3 Insurgent Operations

The Taliban and Warlords choose from Rally, March,
Attack, and Terror Operations.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment or recover friendly forces.
Select any Provinces or Kabul. Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
•	 Taliban may only select Neutral, Opposition (1.6), or Pashtun
spaces (1.3.2-.3).
•	 Warlords may not select Pakistan (1.4.2).

PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction places
1 of its Available Guerrillas or replaces 2 of its Guerrillas with 1 of
its Bases, within stacking (1.4.2). If the space already has at least
1 of that Faction’s Bases and, for the Warlords, is a non-Pashtun
space, the Faction may instead either:

7

•	 Flip all its Guerrillas there Underground (1.4.3) OR
•	 Place a number of its Guerrillas up to the sum of its Bases there
plus the space’s Population value (1.3.2-.3).
The Taliban in 1 Taliban Base space selected for Rally may also conduct Sharia (6.4.2) to build Opposition (unlike in the Support Phase,
regardless of Control). The Sharia costs 1 Resource per Terror marker
removed and level shifted, even if the Rally operation was free.
NOTE: Taliban can Rally at a Base but place or flip no pieces in order
to buy Sharia; they can place a Base and immediately buy Sharia.
3.3.2 March. March Operations move friendly Guerrillas. Moving
Guerrillas may begin in any spaces. Pay 1 Resource per Province or
City that Guerrillas move into (0 Resources to move onto LoCs). If a
Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving Guerrillas must end in a single
destination space. Warlords may not select Pakistan as a destination
(1.4.2). Players may not March on the final Event card (2.3.8).
PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas
desired into adjacent spaces (1.3.3). Warlord Guerrillas move once
only. Taliban Guerrillas may conduct additional Marches (paying
for added destinations) if the destination was Pashtun. Guerrillas
moving from 1 space to another move as a single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving group to Active (1.4.3) if:

•	 The destination is a LoC, or—for Taliban March—a non-Pashtun
space (1.3.2-.3), or—for Warlord March—Pashtun, AND
•	 The moving group’s number of Guerrillas plus the number of
enemy Guerrillas and, for Taliban March only, cubes in the destination space exceeds 3.
EXAMPLE: Two Underground Taliban Guerrillas March from
Ghazni to Bamian, where there are 1 Warlord Guerrilla and 1 Police
cube. The destination is not Pashtun and the total of 4 relevant pieces
exceeds 3, so the Taliban Guerrillas flip to Active.
DESIGN NOTE: The Taliban were Pashtun based, the Afghan warlords mainly Tajik, Uzbek, and other non-Pashtun ethnicities.
3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces;
particularly successful attacks augment friendly Guerrillas (by
capturing enemy weapons, equipment, rations, or recruits). Select
any spaces where the executing Faction has at least 1 Guerrilla and
1 enemy piece; pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less than
or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas there
(whether or not they began Active), remove up to 2 enemy pieces
(executing Faction’s choice; may include Underground Guerrillas).
The 2 pieces may belong to different Factions.

•	 Insurgent Bases cannot be removed before all that Faction’s
Guerrillas in the space.
•	 Coalition or Government Bases cannot be removed before all
cubes (of either Faction) in the space.
•	 Remove Government cubes before Coalition cubes.
•	 Place any Coalition pieces removed by Attack into the Casualties
box.
CAPTURED GOODS: If the roll was a “1”, place 1 of the executing
Faction’s Available Guerrillas (1.4.1) there.

3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Provinces or
Kabul affect Support and Opposition (1.6) and
place Terror markers that hinder future efforts

A Distant Plain

to influence it. On LoCs, they place Sabotage markers that block
Government Resource earnings (6.3.1) and Transport (4.3.2). Select
any spaces where the executing Faction has at least 1 Underground
Guerrilla; pay 1 Resource per Province or Kabul (0 for LoCs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 friendly Underground Guerrilla in each
selected space.

•	 If the space is a Province or Kabul, place a Terror marker. If
Taliban, shift 1 level toward Opposition (1.6). If Warlords, remove
any Support or Opposition (set to Neutral).
•	 If the space is a LoC without a Sabotage marker, place a Sabotage
marker.
•	 Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on the
map. (There are 30.)

4.2.2 Air Lift. Air Lift moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move any Coalition Troops and up to 3 Government
Troops among any 3 spaces (not Pakistan, 1.4.2).
4.2.3 Air Strike. An Air Strike destroys exposed Insurgent units.
It may only accompany a Patrol, Sweep, or Assault (3.2.2-.4) and
take place in up to 3 spaces other than Kabul.
PROCEDURE: In each space, remove 1 Active Guerrilla or, if the
targeted Faction has no Guerrillas there, 1 of its Bases. If any of
the spaces are in Pakistan, shift Islamabad 1 box toward Sponsorship (6.6.1).

4.3 Government Special Activities

NOTE: Several Terror markers may occupy a Province or Kabul,
only 1 Sabotage per LoC.

The Government chooses from Govern, Transport, or Eradicate Special Activities.

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General

4.3.1 Govern. Governing adds returning refugees to a space’s Population or extracts Patronage. It may only accompany Training or Patrol
(3.2.1-.2) and take place in 1 or 2 COIN-Controlled spaces—Provinces
or Kabul—that have either Support or 0 Population.

•	 As with Operations, the executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or pieces affected and the order of actions and must have
enough Resources to pay any costs. A Faction may execute its
Special Activity at any one time immediately before, during, or
immediately after its Operation.

•	 Place an available +1 Population Returnees marker (+1
Pop). There must not yet be a +1 marker in the space.
Once one of the six +1 markers is placed, it is no longer
available.
•	 Transfer the Population value from Aid to Patronage (to a maximum of 40) and set the space to Neutral. There must be no Coalition Base there.

When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes
an Operation in at least 1 space (3.0), it may also execute 1 type of
its Special Activities (exception: Limited Operations, 2.3.5). Some
Events grant free Special Activities (3.1.2, 5.5).

EXAMPLE: The Taliban with 0 Resources Extort enough to pay for
the necessary accompanying Operation thereafter (4.1.1).
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity,
the 2nd Eligible will have the option of executing the card’s Event
(2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities either must occur or may not occur where
their Accompanying Operations occurred. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operations and take place
in any otherwise valid spaces.

4.2 Coalition Special Activities

The Coalition may choose from Surge, Air Lift, or Air Strike
Special Activities.
4.2.1 Surge. Surge brings Coalition forces into or out of Afghanistan
and can add to Aid to the Government (1.8, 6.2.1) or Resources to
the Warlords. It may only accompany Training (3.2.1) and take place
in up to 3 spaces that include Kabul or any Provinces with COIN
Control (never Pakistan, 1.4.2).
PROCEDURE: Move any Coalition pieces desired among the 3
spaces and the Coalition Available Forces box. Then, if desired,
roll a die and distribute that number (fully) among Aid and Warlord
Resources.

DESIGN NOTE: The Coalition must use a Special Activity to add or
remove its foreign forces from the map. The die roll represents the
uncertain outcomes of donor conferences and the like. The Coalition
sometimes paid warlords for local security.

PROCEDURE: In each space, choose one of the following.

NOTE: The Government may Govern benignly and thus attract
more population to control, or less benignly to divert more Aid to
Patronage.
4.3.2 Transport. Transport moves Troops, such as to gain rapid
control of the countryside.
PROCEDURE: Select 1 space and move any Government Troops
from there onto 1 adjacent LoC, if desired. They may continue to
move along adjacent LoCs or through Kabul and then, if desired,
into any 1 adjacent destination (not Pakistan, 1.4.2). Troops must
stop at any Sabotage. Government then transfers 1 Resource to
Warlords (if it has any) for each space entered (LoC, Province, or
City) containing any Guerrillas (regardless of whose).
DESIGN NOTE: Warlord forces, for payment, provided counterinsurgent route security.
4.3.3 Eradicate. Eradication destroys rural Warlord Bases and earns
Aid and Patronage. It may only accompany Train, Patrol, or Assault
(3.2.1,-.2,-.4) and take place in 1 or 2 Provinces (not Kabul) with
COIN Control, Government cubes, and at least 1 Warlord Base.
PROCEDURE: For each space, boost Aid by +3 and Patronage
+1, remove 1 Warlord Base there (regardless of Guerrillas there).
Then:

•	 Shift the Province 1 level toward Opposition (1.6.1), if
possible.
•	 If Pashtun, place a Taliban Guerrilla.
DESIGN NOTE: Farmers tend to resent government destruction of
their crops. The ability to eradicate selectively or falsely can provide
opportunities for corruption.

4.4 Taliban Special Activities

The Taliban choose from Extort, Infiltrate, or Ambush
Special Activities.
4.4.1 Extort. Extortion enables the Taliban to gain Resources from
regions or highways that they dominate. The Taliban may Extort in
any spaces with at least 1 Underground Taliban Guerrilla and more
Taliban than enemy pieces.
PROCEDURE: For each space, Activate 1 Underground Taliban
Guerrilla there (1.4.3). Add +1 or—if an unSabotaged LoC, its Econ
value—to Taliban Resources (1.8). If any Warlord Base there, instead
transfer 2 Resources per Warlord Base from Warlords to Taliban.
4.4.2 Infiltrate. Infiltration replaces Government or Warlord pieces
with Taliban Guerrillas and siphons Patronage. It may only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2). It may occur in any 1 space with at
least 1 Underground Taliban Guerrilla.
PROCEDURE: Remove 2 non-Coalition pieces from the space or
replace 1 there with a Taliban Guerrilla. Government or Warlord
Bases cannot be removed before all Government cubes or Warlord
Guerrillas in the space, respectively. Then reduce Patronage by –1
per Government piece that was removed, if any.
NOTE: Coalition Troops do not protect Government Bases from
Infiltration.
4.4.3 Ambush. Ambush enables the Taliban to ensure the success
of up to 3 Attacks. It must take place in spaces selected for Attack
(3.3.3, not yet resolved) and that each have at least 1 Underground
Taliban Guerrilla (1.4.3).
PROCEDURE: Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3), the
Attacks in those spaces each Activate 1 Underground Guerrilla
only and automatically succeed (do not roll; remove the 2 enemy
pieces normally). Place an Available Taliban Guerrilla in each space
(Underground, 1.4.3) as if a “1” had been rolled.

4.5 Warlords Special Activities

The Warlords may choose from Cultivate, Traffic, or Suborn
Special Activities.
4.5.1 Cultivate. Cultivation adds a new growing area. It may only
accompany a Rally or March Operation (3.3.1-.2). The location
must be a Province selected for Rally or as a March destination,
with Population greater than 0, and with more Warlord Guerrillas
than Police.

9

Guerrilla from the space, or flip any or all Guerrillas there Underground (1.4.3). (Suborn may remove cubes or a Base, not both.)
DESIGN NOTE: Warlords influenced security forces via both ethnic
ties and corruption.

5.0 EVENTS

Each Event bears a title, italicized flavor text, and Event text. Flavor
text provides historical interest and has no effect on play.

5.1 Executing Events

When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally (sometimes involving actions or decisions by other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction makes all
selections involved in implementing the text, such as which pieces
are affected. Some Events with lasting effects have markers as aids
to play.
5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence.
However:

•	 Events never place pieces that are not available (1.4.1); they
remove rather than replace if the replacement is not available.
•	 Events may not violate stacking (1.4.2). They may not place
non-Taliban forces in Pakistan. “Replace” never affects Taliban
in Pakistan.
•	 Events may not raise Aid or Resources beyond 75 or Patronage
beyond 40 (1.8).
•	 Events never allow a Faction to execute a type of Operation or
Special Activity available only to other Factions (3.0, 4.0).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence. EXAMPLE: “MANPADS Scare” could result in Air
Lift even if “Sandstorms” was in effect.
5.1.3 If even per the above not all of an executed Event’s text can
be carried out, implement that which can.

5.2 Dual Use

Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The
executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text
to carry out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the
Counterinsurgents, a player may select either text option regardless of Faction.

PROCEDURE: Place 1 Warlord Base in the space (within stacking, 1.4.2).
4.5.2 Traffic. Trafficking provides immediate Resources from Warlord Bases. It must accompany a Rally or March Operation (3.3.1-.2)
and may occur in any or all spaces with 1 or 2 Warlord Bases and
no Coalition pieces.
PROCEDURE: For each selected space, add +1 Warlord Resource
per Warlord Base. If the space is Taliban-Controlled, also add +1
Taliban Resource (total per space). If the space is COIN-Controlled,
also add +1 Patronage (to max of 40).
4.5.3 Suborn. Suborn neutralizes enemy units or hides Guerrillas
but cost Resources. It may occur in any of up to 3 spaces.
PROCEDURE: For each space, reduce Warlord Resources –2 and
remove up to 3 Government cubes, a Government Base, or a Taliban

DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of the
same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject to
alternative historical interpretation.

5.3 Capabilities

Dual-use Events marked “COALITION
CAPABILITIES” or “TALIBAN CAPABILITIES” have lasting effects that either
help or hurt that Faction. When executing such an Event, place
the corresponding marker on the appropriate side (unshaded is
pro-Coalition, shaded pro-Taliban) in the corresponding Faction’s
Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the rest of the game.
PLAY NOTE: If desired, set out executed Capabilities Event cards
as added reminders.

5.4 Momentum

Event text (unshaded, shaded, or both) marked “MOMENTUM”
also has lasting effects. When executing such text, place the card in
view near the draw pile. The effects last until the next Propaganda
round’s Reset phase (6.6), when the card is discarded. NOTE: Any
number of Momentum Events can be in play.
MARKERS: Place the appropriate “Talks” or
“Tribal Elders” markers on the corresponding
Event card (numbers 24 and 70) to record which
use or which Faction applies.

5.5 Free Operations

Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate
Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual sequence of
play and typically is free: it bears no Resource cost and does not
affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other aspects remain unless
trumped by Event text (5.1.1).
EXAMPLE: Free Suborn (4.5.3) would cost 0 Resources and not
affect Warlords Eligibility. Free Traffic (4.5.2) could not occur in a
space with Coalition unless Event text so specified.

6.0 PROPAGANDA ROUNDS

Conduct a Propaganda Round in the sequence of phases below as
each Propaganda Card is played. The Sequence of Play sheet and
board also list this sequence.
Exception: Never conduct more than 1 Propaganda Round in a
row (without at least 1 Event card in between)—instead, additional
Propaganda cards are played without a Propaganda Round. If final
(2.4.1), end the game and determine victory (7.3).

6.1 Victory Phase

If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends (exceptions: Non-player option [1.5]; 1-player [8.9]). See Victory (7.0)
to determine winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue with the
Propaganda Round. After conducting the final Propaganda card’s
Round (2.4.1), determine victory per 7.3.

6.3 Resources Phase

Follow these steps to add to Factions’ Resources to a
maximum of 75 (1.8).
6.3.1 Sabotage. Sabotage (3.3.4) each unSabotaged LoC
where the number of Taliban Guerrillas exceeds non-Taliban pieces.

6.3.2 Government Earnings. Add Aid plus the Economic value
(1.3.4) of all LoCs that have no Sabotage (12 minus the Econ value
of any Sabotaged LoCs) to Government Resources.
6.3.3 Insurgent Earnings. Add to Resources:

•	 Taliban–The number of their Bases on map.
•	 Warlords–The number of their Bases on map plus the number of
their Guerrillas on unSabotaged LoCs.
6.3.4 Casualties and Aid. Finally, subtract from Aid 3 times the
number of pieces in the Casualties box (3.3.3).

6.4 Support Phase

The COIN Factions then the Taliban may spend Resources to affect
popular Support and Opposition (1.6).
6.4.1 Civic Action. The Coalition and then the Government may
spend any number of Government Resources to build Support in
Provinces or Kabul City if the space has COIN Control, Troops, and
Police. Every 3 Resources spent removes 1 Terror marker or—once
no Terror is in a space—shifts it 1 level toward Support. The Faction
that has the most Troops in the space (Coalition if equal number)
decides how much Civic Action is bought.
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police together provide the security needed to make gains in popular support. See also Training,
3.2.1.

6.4.2 Sharia. Taliban may spend Resources to encourage Opposition
in Taliban-Controlled spaces (1.6). Every 1 Resource they spend
removes 1 Terror marker or—once no Terror is in a space—shifts
it 1 level toward Opposition.

DESIGN NOTE: Taliban administration of Islamic law (sharia)
could help resolve local disputes. See also Rally, 3.3.1.

6.5 Redeploy Phase

Redeploy forces as follows without adjusting COIN or Taliban
Control until afterwards.
6.5.1 Desertion. Each space, the Government must select and
remove 1 in 3 of its cubes (round down) to its Available Forces.
NOTE: Two Government cubes alone are unaffected.
6.5.2 Redeploy. The Coalition may move any of its Troops on LoCs
or in Provinces without COIN Bases (only) to COIN-Controlled
spaces (1.7) with COIN Bases or to Kabul. Then the Government
must do so with its Troops.
6.5.3 The Government may move any Police to any LoCs or COINControlled spaces (1.7).

DESIGN AND PLAY NOTE: While Troops are the Counterinsurgents’ main means of establishing presence in the countryside, Police
are the main means of staying there over time.
6.5.4 The Taliban next must move any of their Guerrillas on LoCs
or in Provinces without Taliban Bases to spaces with Taliban Bases
and under Taliban Control (1.7) or to Pashtun spaces in Pakistan.
(Guerrillas in Kabul stay.)
DESIGN NOTE: Many Taliban fought seasonally.
6.5.5 Control. Now adjust COIN and Taliban Control (1.7) to reflect
the above moves.
6.5.6 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.1), end
and determine victory (7.3).

6.6 Reset Phase

7.2 During Propaganda Rounds

Prepare for the next card as follows:

•	 Casualties. Remove all Bases and 1 in 2 Troops (round down)
in the Casualties box from the game. Move the remaining Troop
Casualties to Coalition Available.
•	 Islamabad. If the Islamabad marker is Hard, flip it over. If not,
shift it 1 box toward “Backing” (6.6.1).
•	 Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
•	 Remove all Terror and Sabotage markers (3.3.4).
•	 Place any cards in the Momentum holding boxes onto the played
cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
•	 Flip all Guerrillas to Underground (1.4.3).
•	 Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s
new top card (2.3.8).
6.6.1 The Islamabad Track. The Islamabad track
shows Pakistan’s posture toward the Taliban and
corresponding effects.

•	
•	
•	
•	

11

•	
Hostility. No Taliban Rally (3.3.1) in Pakistan.
Taliban Guerrillas in Pakistan are always Active (1.4.3).
Pressure. No Taliban Rally in Pakistan.
Tolerance. No effect.
Backing. Taliban Rally in Pakistan and March (3.3.2) to or from
Pakistan spaces cost 0 Resources.
Sponsorship. Taliban Rally in and March (3.3.2) to or from
Pakistan spaces cost 0 Resources. Any Taliban Limited Operations (2.3.5) may occur in multiple spaces (as if a normal Op
only [2.3.3], no Special Activity). (See also Non-player Taliban,
8.7.6.)

ISLAMABAD SHIFTS: Immediately shift the Islamabad marker right
or left on the track as the following apply (as noted on the track).
•	 Events. Several Events shift Islamabad.
•	 Air Strike. Whenever an Air Strike (4.2.3) includes one or more
spaces in Pakistan, shift 1 box toward “Sponsorship”.
•	 Reset. Each Reset phase (6.6), either flip the Islamabad marker
if Hard (below), or shift it 1 box toward “Backing” if not.
HARDENED POSTURE: If any of the above would
shift Islamabad beyond either end of the track, instead
flip the marker to (or keep it at) “Hard”.

NOTE: The marker at Hard shifts normally, except
during Reset.

Check victory at the start of each Propaganda Round (6.1), comparing the positions of the various victory markers (1.9) and the
Warlord Resources cylinder to the thresholds marked on the edge
track. Victory conditions are:
•	 Coalition—Total Population in Support plus the number of pieces
in the Coalition Available Forces box exceeds 30.
•	 Government—Total COIN-Controlled Population plus Patronage
exceeds 35.
•	 Taliban—Total Population in Opposition plus the number of
Taliban Bases on the map exceeds 20.
•	 Warlords—Total Uncontrolled Population within Afghanistan
exceeds 15 and Warlord Resources exceed 40.

7.3 After Final Propaganda

If the final Propaganda Round (2.4.1) is completed without a victory
check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory margin wins.
A victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or short of its
condition set forth in 7.2.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
•	
•	
•	
•	

Coalition: Total Support + Available Coalition pieces – 30.
Government: COIN-Controlled Population + Patronage – 35.
Taliban: Total Opposition + Taliban Bases – 20.
Warlords: Lower of Uncontrolled Afghan Population – 15 or
Warlord Resources – 40.
Victory Deception Option: For less knowledge of how close
Factions in 3- or 4-player games are to winning, each player at
start blindly draws 2 Deception markers. Set aside the rest; they
may not be inspected. Players may reveal any of their Deception
markers only as they use them:
Empty Threat: No effect (reveal at game end).

Hidden Agenda: Permanently add +1 to the holding player’s
victory margin (7.3).

Hidden Asset: Convert any 1 LimOp option (2.3.5) into a full
Op & Special Activity Option.

STOP!

7.0 VICTORY

Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Faction aid sheets.

You have read all rules needed for 4 players or the no Non-Player
option (1.5, recommended if playing the first time).

7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties

If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2), all
players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player does so or if
none does by game end, the Faction that reached the highest victory
margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd-highest comes in 2nd place,
and so on. Ties go to Non-players (8.0), then the Warlords, then the
Government, then the Taliban. (See also 1player victory, 8.8.)

8.0 NON-PLAYER FACTIONS

This section governs actions by any Factions beyond those represented by a player. See also the Playbook’s 1-Player Example of
Play.

•	

NOTE: Non-player Factions may not act only in their own direct
interest. Like players, they sometimes help, sometimes harm, one
another.

•	

8.1 Non-Player Sequence of Play

•	

The Sequence of Play aid sheet summarizes the following rules in
gray text.

•	 Event or Ops? Except as specified below and in any special Event
Instructions (8.4.1), a Non-player Faction when given the option
(2.3.4) chooses the Event.
•	 Capabilities/Islamabad. Non-player Warlords only opt for
Capabilities Events (5.3) or those that would affect the Islamabad
Track (6.6.1) if the Taliban are a Non-player. Non-player
Government only does so if the Coalition is a Non-player. Nonplayer Taliban and Coalition opt for Capabilities Events only on a
die roll less than the number of Propaganda cards left in the deck.
•	 Ineffective Events. Regardless of the above, Non-player Factions
opt only for Events that would have an effect (something happens,
including Capabilities, 5.3) and for Momentum Events (5.4) other
than “Mullah Omar” only when the next card showing is not
Propaganda.
•	 Operations Not Limited. Whenever a Non-player Faction is to
execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5), it instead executes a full
Operation and Special Activity. Ignore the Final Event Card
restriction (2.3.8).
•	 Low Resources. When a Non-player Insurgent with 0 Resources—or the Government with fewer than 3—is to execute
Operations, it Passes instead (earning Resources, 2.3.3). NOTE:
A Non-player Coalition can Operate even when the Government
is out of Resources.
INEFFECTIVE EVENT EXAMPLE: Non-player Warlords are 1st
Eligible for “Change in Tactics.” No Capabilities markers are yet
in play. The Event would have no effect, so the Warlords execute
Operations and a Special Activity.
8.1.1 Operations, Special Activities, and Events. To execute a
Non-player Faction’s Operations and Special Activities or a specific Event, see the Non-Player flow charts and the relevant rules
below.
GUIDELINES: Unless otherwise specified, carry out whatever actions apply to the maximum extent (such as with the most pieces
allowed and only as long as needed pieces and Resources are
available). Normal Resource costs, requirements, and procedures
still apply.
EXAMPLE: Non-Player Terror requires Activating an Underground
Guerrilla and costs 1 Resource per Province, per 3.3.4.
8.1.2 Procedure Guidelines. Unless otherwise specified, once
spaces involved are selected, Non-player Factions:

•	 Target or remove enemy players’ before Non-players’ assets
whenever possible.
•	 Remove enemy Bases before other pieces, Underground before
Active Guerrillas, and Police then Troops evenly (each space);
otherwise select randomly among enemy Factions. Remove pieces

•	

to be replaced even if no pieces are available to replace them
(1.4.1).
Place friendly Bases whenever possible. Exception: Place no
more than 1 Government Base per space. Remove friendly Active
before Underground Guerrillas. Place or remove friendly Police
and Troops evenly, Police first.
March so as to get as many Underground Guerrillas as possible
to the destination (3.3.2). Within that requirement, March Active
Guerrillas first.
Do not move a piece out of a space if that would place or remove
Control there (1.7). Exception: Surge (8.8.2).
Voluntarily transfer nothing (1.5.1).

MARCH EXAMPLE: Non-player Warlord Guerrillas are Marching
into an empty Pashtun space. If any were Underground, only 3 of
them would move, first those Underground.
PLAY NOTE: Players may transfer (1.5.1) to Non-player Factions
normally.

8.2 Random Spaces

If several candidate spaces have equal priority for a Non-player
Operation, Special Activity, or Event, select a Province or Kabul
using the Random Spaces table:

•	 Roll the three dice and refer to the table: tan indicates column,
black indicates row of space trios, and green indicates the space
within the trio (unless Kabul).
•	 If the resulting space is not a candidate, move down the column
until one is reached. Follow the arrows, moving from the bottom
of one column to the top of the next and from Kandahar to
Balochistan (or just follow the arrows on the Random Spaces
Map).
•	 Carry out as much of the action as possible in the candidate
reached, then roll again to select another, if needed.
PLAY NOTE: If players agree, choose among a few spaces by equalchance die roll instead.

8.3 Random LoCs

If only LoCs are candidates, choose:

•	 First that with the highest Econ.
•	 Then with an equal chance die roll.
Sabotage only unSabotaged LoCs.

8.4 Non-Player Events

NOTE: Events will not always benefit the executing Non-player
Faction directly.
Halo

8.4.1 Event Instructions. Whenever any Non-player Faction is to
execute an Event and that Faction’s symbol on the card has a gray
halo, first check any special instructions for that Event at the bottom
of that Faction’s sheet.
8.4.2 Dual Use. Non-player Warlords and Taliban executing a
Dual-Use Event (5.2) use shaded text, Non-player Government and
Coalition use unshaded, unless Event Instructions note otherwise
(8.4.1).

© 2013, 2015 GMT Games, LLC

A Distant Plain
8.4.3 Placement. Place, remove, or relocate as many pieces (per
8.1.2) as the Event, availability (1.4.1), and stacking (1.4.2) allow.
8.4.4 Who and Where. Unless otherwise specified:

•	 When there is a choice of who gets Event benefits (such as placing
pieces or free Operations), select the executing Faction, then
another random Non-player Faction.
•	 For free Operations or Special Activities, use that Faction’s
priorities (8.5-8.8).
•	 Select Event spaces to ensure that as many Bases then other pieces
as possible are placed, removed, or replaced, then for the greatest
change in Total Support/Opposition.
•	 Otherwise, select spaces randomly (8.2.3).

8.5 Non-Player Warlords Actions

NOTE: It is not necessary to master the rules below for
specific Factions because they are summarized on the Non-player
foldout.
8.5.1 Rally. If at least 6 Warlords pieces are available, Rally in up
to 3 Provinces:

•	 First, flip Guerrillas Underground in any non-Pashtun Provinces
where Warlord Guerrillas are all Active and there is a Warlord
Base and a cube.
•	 Then, place Bases where there are at least 2 Warlord Guerrillas
and room.
•	 Then, place Guerrillas, first, where Warlords have Bases but no
Guerrillas; then, where they have Guerrillas but there are no Bases;
then, if no Cultivate yet possible, in 1 Province where Cultivate
could then place a Base (4.5.1); finally, in other random Provinces.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.5.4.
IF NONE: If no such Rally is possible, instead March as below.
8.5.2 March. If Rally conditions (8.5.1) are not met and the sum
of Warlord Resources plus Warlord Bases on the map is 50 or less,
instead March. March from all adjacent Provinces or Kabul, without
moving the last Warlord Guerrilla from a space with a Warlord Base
(nor adding any Control markers, 8.1.2):
•	 Onto 1 empty LoC (high Econ first, 8.3) with 1 Guerrilla.
•	 Next, with all possible Guerrillas (per 8.1.2) to all spaces where
their arrival would remove Control, first to highest Population.
•	 Then, with all possible (within 8.1.2) into 1 random Province,
first a Province in which Cultivate could then place a Base.
Then execute a Special Activity per 8.5.4.

13

or, if that not possible, Suborn. If they executed Terror, Suborn.
CULTIVATE: Cultivate to place a Base in a random eligible space
(4.5.1), if possible, a space that already has 1 Warlord Base. If none
or no Base available, instead Traffic as follows.
TRAFFIC: Unless Warlord Resources would reach 75, Traffic in all
spaces with Warlord Bases and no Coalition pieces (4.5.2). If they
would reach 75, or if there are no such spaces (or only 1 Warlord
Base with “Counter-Narc” in effect), instead Suborn.
SUBORN: Suborn (4.5.3) in up to 3 spaces.

•	 First, remove Government or Taliban pieces—Government Bases
if possible—so as to remove either COIN or Taliban Control where
possible to do so in Afghanistan.
•	 Then, remove Taliban Guerrillas if the Coalition is a Non-player,
otherwise Government pieces, from random spaces, LoCs first
and spaces in Pakistan last.
If no such Suborn is possible (the Warlords have fewer than 2 Resources or “Local Truce” is in effect), execute no Special Activity.

8.6 Non-Player Government Actions

8.6.1 Momentum. For the following Event in effect (5.4)
with a Non-player Government:

•	 Tribal Elders—If executed by Government, always set to Support,
unless that would raise Coalition’s victory margin (7.3) above
Government’s, in which case set to Neutral.
8.6.2 Train. If at least 15 Government pieces are available or Govern
could add Patronage at this moment (4.3.1), Train in these spaces:

•	 First, in 1 Province that has at least 3 Government cubes, no COIN
Base, and room for one, replacing the 3 Government cubes with
an available Base.
•	 Then, to place from Available up to 6 cubes each (4 if shaded
“Night Letters” in effect, 5.3) among Kabul and up to 3 COIN Base
spaces, first in 1 space as needed to enable any Civic Action per
below, then where the fewest Government cubes (and per 8.1.2).
If no Base placed, in any 1 of these spaces where Civic Action is
possible (3.2.1) and there are no Coalition Bases (if any), shift as
far as possible toward Support.
GOVERN: Then Govern in up to 2 COIN-Controlled spaces (4.3.1).
First, where Support and no Coalition Base, transfer Patronage from
Aid (if any) and set to Neutral. Then, where 0 Population (and COIN
Control), add a +1Pop marker (if any available). Finally, wherever
else possible, add +1Pop.
•	 If no such Govern possible, instead Transport.

IF NONE: If not possible, Terror per below.
8.5.3 Terror. If neither Rally nor March conditions above are met,
execute Terror (with an Underground Guerrilla, 3.3.4) in 1 space:
•	 If the Coalition is a Non-player, where Opposition.
•	 If the Taliban are a Non-player, where Support.
•	 If neither applies or is possible, in a random Support or Opposition
space.
Then Suborn per 8.5.4.

IF NONE: If no such Terror is possible, instead Rally per 8.5.1 or,
if that not possible, Pass.
8.5.4 Special Activities. If Non-player Warlords executed Rally or
March, next Cultivate if possible per the following, otherwise Traffic

TRANSPORT: First, find a COIN-Controlled space that has the most
Government Troops in excess of those needed to maintain Control
(1.7). Transport those excess Troops—leaving at least 1 Govt Troop
even if excess—to a Province that has Police but no Troops nor
COIN Base, if possible. If not, Transport them to the space where
they would add the most COIN-Controlled Population (more than
0), if possible by replacing Taliban Control.
•	 If not possible, execute no Special Activity.

IF NONE: If no such Training possible, Patrol.
8.6.3 Patrol. If Training conditions (8.6.2) are not met and Taliban
Guerrillas on an LoC or in Kabul exceed non-Taliban pieces, Patrol.
Move cubes to equal Taliban Guerrillas, if possible 1 Police per LoC
and Kabul, the rest Troops. Take each Police or Troops cube from a

City or Province with the most that can reach the destination LoC.
Assault on a LoC to remove the most Taliban possible.

•	 Finally, buy Sharia (8.7.7) for the greatest possible shift in 1 of
the above Rally spaces.

IF NONE: If no such Patrol is possible, Sweep.

EXTORT: Then Extort any unSabotaged 3Econ and 4-Econ LoCs
possible.

•	 Then Govern or Transport as above (8.6.2).

8.6.4 Sweep. If neither Training nor Patrol conditions (8.6.2-.3) are
met and Assault per 8.6.5 (with Eradicate) would remove neither a
Base nor at least 2 Guerrillas, Sweep 3 spaces to Activate Taliban
then Warlord Guerrillas:

•	 First, in the highest Population space possible, move in enough
Troops to add COIN Control, from any spaces that can reach it.
•	 Then, without moving, to Activate the most Underground Taliban
then Warlord Guerrillas possible, Kabul first if tied.

•	 If not possible (4.4.1), instead Infiltrate.
INFILTRATE: Infiltrate (4.4.2) to replace a piece with a Guerrilla,
or, if no Guerrillas Available, to remove 2 enemy pieces. Target Government first. Infiltrate on a LoC, if possible; otherwise to remove
a Government Base, if possible; then the last Police from a space,
if possible; otherwise in a random space.
•	 If no such Infiltrate targets, Extort everywhere possible; if none
possible, no Special Activity.

Then Transport per 8.6.2.

IF NONE: If no such Rally possible, March.

IF NONE: If no such Sweep possible, Assault.

8.7.3 March. If Rally conditions (8.7.2) are not met and Support
spaces and LoCs have neither Underground Taliban Guerrillas nor
at least 4 Taliban Guerrillas total, March from all Taliban Control
spaces that have at least 2 Taliban Guerrillas (and per 8.1.2).

8.6.5 Assault. If neither Training nor Patrol conditions are met
and Assault with any Eradication would remove a Base or at least
2 Guerrillas, Assault up to 3 spaces:

•	 First in spaces to remove the most Taliban Bases, then to remove
the most Taliban then Warlord Guerrillas possible, on LoCs
last.
•	 In each space, target Taliban then Warlords.
ERADICATE: Then Eradicate in 1 or 2 eligible spaces (4.3.3),
first where there is Opposition, then in nonPashtun spaces, then at
random.
•	 If no Eradication possible, Transport per 8.6.2.
IF NONE: If no such Assault possible, Pass.
8.6.6 Civic Action. During the Support Phase or Events, buy Civic
Action (6.4.1) to remove all Opposition possible. Then, if this Propaganda Round is not the final one (2.4.1), add Support to spaces
without Coalition Bases (only).
8.6.7 Redeploy. Ensure COIN Control of Kabul (without losing other
Control, 8.1.2), then keep Government Troops spread evenly (6.5.2).
Redeploy Police (6.5.3) to maintain Control (such as where Troops
left), then to have 2 Police on each 3- and 4- Econ LoC, spread as
evenly as possible among Provinces and Kabul.

8.7 Non-Player Taliban Actions
8.7.1 Momentum. If in effect (5.4):

•	 MANPADS Scare. Non-player Taliban with Resources pay to
cancel any Air Lift or Air Strike (4.2.2-.3) on a die roll of 1-4.
•	 Tribal Elders—If executed by Non-player Taliban, always shift
to Opposition.
8.7.2 Rally. If Taliban have at least 15 pieces available or at least 15
Guerrillas Active, Rally in these eligible spaces (3.3.1):

•	 First, in up to 3 with Taliban Guerrillas all of which are Active,
a Taliban Base, and any cubes, flip the Guerrillas Underground.
•	 Then, where at least 3 Taliban Guerrillas and room, replace 2
Guerrillas with a Base.
•	 If there is no Underground Taliban Guerrilla in Kabul, place a
Guerrilla there.
•	 Then place Guerrillas, first to add Taliban Control to 1 space
that does not have it yet, then in 1 space that has 1 or 2 Taliban
Guerrillas, then at all Taliban Bases.

•	 First, enter all unSabotaged LoCs and then Kabul adjacent to
such spaces, until Taliban exceed non-Taliban by 1 piece, to at
most 2 Taliban Guerrillas per space. Then enter 2 Provinces that
have neither Opposition nor Taliban Control, from such origin
spaces.
•	 Finally, March from such origins toward and then into 2 other
Provinces with neither Opposition nor Taliban Control and
reachable via Pashtun spaces, with up to Guerrillas needed to
add Taliban Control. Select lowest-cost route (closest origins
first). Pashtun destinations above or along the route become
origins—March Guerrillas from there also.
•	 Leave 1 Taliban Guerrilla at each origin, if possible one that is
Underground (and March only per 8.1.2, losing no Control).
Then Extort or Infiltrate per 8.7.2.
IF NONE: If no such March is possible, Attack.
NOTE: Unless “Sandstorms” is in effect (5.4), Taliban Guerrillas
in Pashtun spaces can March even if they just Marched (3.3.2). If
Islamabad is at Backing or Sponsorship, March via Pakistan spaces
costs less (6.6.1).
8.7.4 Attack. If neither Rally nor March conditions (8.7.2-.3) are
met and Total Support plus Available Coalition pieces is 20 or less,
Attack (3.3.3) in 3 spaces (LoCs last, 8.2) where Taliban could
Ambush—first to remove at least 1 Coalition piece. Then Attack
in each other space with at least 4 already Active (1.4.3) Taliban
Guerrillas and a Coalition piece. In each space, remove Coalition
first if possible, then Government, then Warlords.
AMBUSH: Ambush (4.4.3) in the 3 spaces with the fewest Taliban
Guerrillas. If tied, choose first where a Coalition piece then a Government Base could be removed. If shaded “Car Bombs” in effect (5.3),
use an Active Guerrilla in a space with no Underground Taliban. If
no Ambush possible, execute no Special Activity.
IF NONE: If no such Attack possible, instead execute Terror or, if
that not possible, Pass.
8.7.5 Terror. If neither Rally nor March conditions (8.7.2-.3) are
met and Support + Available is above 20, instead execute Terror
(3.3.4) to Sabotage all LoCs and shift as much Support/Opposition
possible.

15

EXTORT: Then Extort (4.4.1) everywhere possible. If none, execute
no Special Activity.

COIN Control to 1 space, first where Taliban, then at the highest
Population.

IF NONE: If no such Terror possible, instead Attack per 8.7.4 or,
if not possible, Pass.

•	 If no such Air Lift is possible, execute no Special Activity.

8.7.6 Islamabad. If Islamabad is at Sponsorship (6.6.1), Non-player
Taliban stay Eligible (2.3.1) after executing Events (including an
Event that just obtained Sponsorship).

IF NONE: If no such Training possible, Sweep.
8.8.3 Sweep. If 4 or more Taliban are with COIN pieces and Assault
per 8.8.4 (even with Air Lift or Air Strike) would fail to remove any
Base or at least 4 Taliban pieces, Sweep all spaces with Coalition
pieces in place to Activate Taliban then Warlord Guerrillas:

8.7.7 Sharia. Non-player Taliban conduct all Sharia (6.4.2) they can,
first for the greatest shift, then where Support, then where fewest
Terror markers, then randomly. Remove Terror only if a shift would
be achieved.
8.7.8 Redeploy. Keep Taliban Guerrillas (6.5.4) spread as evenly as
possible, with odd Guerrillas in Afghan spaces if possible.

8.8 Non-Player Coalition Actions
8.8.1 Momentum. If in effect (5.4):

•	 Tribal Elders—If executed by Non-player Coalition, always shift
to Support.
8.8.2 Train. If spaces with COIN (Coalition or Government) pieces
have fewer than 4 Taliban pieces among them, Train in up to 3
spaces:

•	 First, if Patronage exceeds 20 or Government has less than 3
Resources, Train in Kabul to transfer exactly 3 Patronage to
Government Resources; then place Available cubes there as
possible.
•	 If not (or if less than 3 Patronage), Train to buy Civic Actions
per 8.8.5 in 1 space—2 spaces if unshaded “PRTs” is in effect
(5.3)—where Civic Action could achieve a shift (3.2.1). Then
place as many Available cubes as possible into the space(s).
•	 Finally, at Coalition Bases without more than 6 Government pieces
beyond those needed for COIN Control, place Available cubes;
once no more Available, take Police from spaces with the most
to add up to 3 per Training space.
•	 If Training occurred and unshaded “Village Stability Operations”
is in effect, place 1 Police where Coalition Troops and fewest
Police, if needed from the space with the most Police.
SURGE: Then Surge in COIN-Control spaces:

•	 Unless the next Propaganda Round will be final (2.4.1), roll a die
and place 1 Base each into up to half that roll (rounded down)
of spaces that have no Coalition Base yet and have the highest
Population, those without Government Bases when tied; then
place up to the same die roll of Troops from Available as evenly
as possible into those and other spaces totaling up to 3, first where
Taliban.
•	 If the next Propaganda will be final, instead remove to Available
all Coalition Troops from 1 space (even if Control lost, 8.1.2), if
tied, a space with the least Population.
•	 In either case, add a die roll in Aid.
If no pieces can thus be placed in or removed from such spaces,
Air Lift instead.
AIR LIFT: After Training without a Surge, Air Lift from 2 COINControlled spaces that have the most Coalition Troops in excess of
those needed to keep Control, with as many Coalition and Government Troops as possible without losing that Control or removing
the last Coalition or last Government Troop. Move them to add

•	 If Air Lift into a space before Sweeping would Activate the last
Underground Taliban there (that otherwise would not be), first
Air Lift into such a space that would Activate the most. If not (or
if shaded “ISR” is in effect), Air Strike.
•	 If unshaded “ISR” is in effect, Activate Taliban, first on a LoC,
then the last Underground Taliban in an Afghan space, then at
random.
AIR LIFT: Move as many Troops as possible—selecting 2 origin
spaces as in an Air Lift after Training (8.8.2)—to the Sweep or
Assault space.
AIR STRIKE: Target Taliban, first Bases, then where possible the
last Taliban in a space, then most Guerrillas. Among those, select
Pakistan first if Islamabad is at Sponsorship and Hard (6.6.1). If
unshaded “Predators” is in effect, select first 1 Pakistan space with
the fewest Guerrillas, removing 1 piece there per 8.1.2.
•	 If not possible, execute no Special Activity.

IF NONE: If no such Sweep is possible or would Activate any
Guerrillas, Assault.
8.8.4 Assault. If Assault with Air Lift or Air Strike would remove
a Base or at least 4 Taliban pieces, all Coalition Troops Assault to
remove Taliban then Warlords:

•	 If Air Lift into a space before Assaulting would remove at least
4 Taliban pieces or a Taliban Base that would not be removed by
Assault plus Air Strike, first Air Lift per 8.8.3 into such a space
to remove the most Taliban pieces. If no such Air Lift possible,
Air Strike per 8.8.3.
•	 Assault first in spaces to remove the most Taliban Bases, then the
most Taliban Guerrillas, then where highest Population.
•	 Pay to use Government cubes only in the first space where they
increase removal, plus wherever needed to remove a Base.
•	 If shaded “Accidental Guerrillas” is in effect and Assault plus
Air Lift or Air Strike would remove just 1 Guerrilla total, instead
Pass.
IF NONE: If no such Assault is possible, Pass.
8.8.5 Civic Action. Non-player Coalition buys all Civic Action that
it can (3.2.1, 6.4.1), first for the greatest shift, then where Opposition,
then where fewest Terror markers, then randomly. Remove Terror
only to achieve a shift.
8.8.6 Redeploy. Non-player Coalition Troops Redeploy when able
(6.5.2) only from spaces that have no Police, to eligible spaces with
fewest Coalition Troops.

A Distant Plain

8.9 1-Player Victory

A 1-player game ends during a Propaganda Round Victory Phase
(7.2) only after the 1st Round and only if the player (Coalition or
Taliban) has a victory margin (7.3) less than that of at least one other
Faction. To succeed, the player must avoid that situation through
each Propaganda Round and have the highest margin after the final
Round. If not, the Non-player with the highest margin (ties to Warlords, then Government) wins Afghanistan:

•	 If Warlords—Feudal Patchwork! Afghanistan returns to its
primordial normal, a region of fiefdoms rather than a nation.
Opium production flourishes.
•	 If Government—Pashtun Dictatorship! Karzai successors
consolidate control—loyal to themselves rather than any
international norms or bonds. Peace with the warlords and Taliban
is shaky, human rights off the agenda.
•	 If Non-Player Taliban—Extremist Return! The central
Government falls in the face of Coalition withdrawal and Pashtun
yearning for Taliban stability. Years of Coalition effort have left
Afghanistan as it was before 2001.
•	 If Non-Player Coalition—Fundamentalism Denied! The invaders
have exhausted the Taliban, reduced to negotiating their place in
an Afghanistan ruled by laws of man not God.

PLAYER VICTORY: If the player does survive to the final Round
with the highest victory margin, subtract the highest Non-player
margin from the player’s to find the degree of success:
•	 1 to 5—Stalemate! While no Taliban takeover is in immediate
prospect, neither is stability nor good governance. The Coalition
withdraws with Afghans’ future still in doubt.
•	 6 or more, Player as Coalition—Surge Vindicated! Confounding
the skeptics, well-resourced counterinsurgency has enabled
modern Afghan institutions to gain popular support. National
reconciliation is underway.
•	 6 or more, Player as Taliban—Glory to the Jihad! In the great
tradition of the Pashtun warrior, the foreign infidel is once again
evicted and true Islam restored to the land.
EXAMPLE: A solo Taliban player avoids Non-player victory over 4
Propaganda Rounds. At game end, with COIN Control + Patronage
at 34, Govt has a 1 victory margin—the highest of the Non-players.
Opposition is 9 and Taliban have all 12 Bases out, so the player’s
victory margin is +1: 2 above Govt’s for a “Stalemate”.

do not place removed Capabilities into effect.

•	 Split remaining Event cards into the number of roughly (or, if
desired, exactly) equal piles specified. Shuffle 1 Propaganda
card into each pile and stack 1 pile onto the other to form a
face-down draw deck in easy view of all players (set aside any
remaining Propaganda cards).
