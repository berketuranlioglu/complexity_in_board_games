1. Roll Dice
On your turn, you can roll the dice up to
three times. You can stop rolling any time.
On the first Roll, roll the 6 black dice (and
1 or 2 green dice if you have a Power card
that lets you roll them). For your
second Roll, if you like some
of your results, you can set
them aside and only roll the
ones you don’t like again.
For your third Roll, if you
change your mind, you can
roll any dice you set aside
again, along with any you
still don’t like.
