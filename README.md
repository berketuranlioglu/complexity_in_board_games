# complexity_in_board_games
UniMi Information Retrieval project that aims the measure the complexity of the rulebooks and predict the difficulty level of board games.

In this project, rulebooks of various games were analyzed and their text complexity measured over simple metrics. Then, these complexity metrics
were used to calculate its own difficulty measurements with "Linear Regression with OLS" method. These measurements were then compared
to actual weights of the games.
